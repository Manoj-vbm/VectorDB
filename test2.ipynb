They really found religion around software is magic. The things that people can create now that we've done this BASIC interpreter and these machines are cheap and plentiful.

The computer science department there was really good. There were great people. Steve Russell had come out there. There was real talent, and they were churning out graduates out of the U-Dub that would go on to populate Microsoft for decades to come.\n",

The reason they were coming around to this was because they knew from Xerox PARC just as well as Apple did, and they were rapidly trying to figure out how to get All of that Xerox PARC-iness into their product line, too.

By 1984, it's an aging set of technologies. It debuts with 128K of memory, which basically isn't enough to create any interesting applications. Developers are ignoring it as an interesting platform to develop on. Within 12 months, they figure it out and come out with a better version that's 512K.

What ends up happening is Apple's really trying to promote the sales of this machine. They view Excel and PageMaker as the killer apps, as reasons that people should buy this thing, because once you run through a lot of the demo apps and the stuff that Apple built, you're like, okay, what else is here?

They don't want to miss the next wave. Meanwhile, also in the applications group, Charles Simonyi has written Word. This is about a year before in 1983. Microsoft Word comes out for DOS.\n",

But I can imagine how useful the mouse is going to be in a word processing environment. They actually ship a mouse tied to the application that's not a part of DOS. This is how early we were in figuring out what the split between applications and platforms were at this point in history.

It was not overlapping Windows that you can drag around and have one over the other. When you opened a program in Windows 1.0, the system created a literal window of it on your screen, and then it dynamically resized the windows as you open other applications. Nothing could ever be on top of each other. As you open more and more stuff, the windows get smaller and smaller and smaller. It's very bizarre.\n",

Let's just do what users love and see what happens. Let's just do what technology enables us to do and see what happens. That's the opposite of IBM's culture at this point.

Do you really think that these companies want to keep a whole separate ledger of what machines they shipped DOS on or Windows on versus what machines they shipped period? Wouldn't it just be easier if once a month or once a quarter, they could just report to us their total shipments like they have to report to their investors anyway, and then we'll just send them an invoice for all their machines?\n",

It was going to take a long time to sell and deploy, and it was going to have really strict requirements for what it could work on because it's a power hungry operating system built for enterprise IT administrators.

Yes, an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others sheds light on the DRG (Developer Relations Group) strategy. We got to go out and be massive evangelists, and everyone in the systems group is looking over at the apps group going, did you see that? Bill Gates just said our strategy is Windows.

Is it just that software was such an unbelievably good business model compared to everything else that existed? They didn't need a lot of working capital, everything was high margin, they could grow really fast. Or it was just an era before much competition. They didn't need to out-raise their competitors.

Unless you are in a transformational moment in terms of a new technology came out that enables something that wasn't possible before that's going to rearrange the whole value chain and open up new markets, it's pretty hard to go challenge an incumbent. No one was going to challenge IBM really until the microcomputer, even the minicomputer people. Did DEC really challenge IBM? Not really. It never made a dent.\n",

What I'm referring to in this particular example is despite all of the dethroning that we just talked about, Microsoft would not eclipse IBM in revenue.

I'm sure there was a better story there, so there's a multiple that comes out of the story. I'm sure there are lots of good reasons why Microsoft became more valuable than IBM very early, but IBM's revenue did not peak until 2012. What?\n",

(1) We laid out principles for product and then pushed responsibility down. Developers were often their own PMs. There's this idea of once you got the principles, we don't need to write a zillion specs, design something three times, and pass it through three functions. You know the principles, make great software that follows the principles. (2) He said that everyone felt personally responsible for the product, and it really showed.\n",

It meant that every time they shipped software, they had to make it globally ready quickly. That meant that if there was any network effects to your software, anything becoming a standard, Microsoft was just way better positioned to become the standard than anyone else was.\n",

They would think about it as lesser than the US market. They just did a good job at localization. They just cared. They thought of it as this is a strategic pillar that in every country, everyone experiences our software to the same quality because it's our brand everywhere. I don't know.

      "     <p>\n",

They had no shame in doing that. They had their eyes everywhere looking for good ideas, they had reverence for the good ones, and then they would just incorporate them.\n",
      "     </p>\n",
      "     <p>\n",

In broad strokes, you can say that's what Microsoft strategy was with applications over the years, but the Microsoft versions never actually won until there was a platform shift that they could take advantage of to beat the incumbent.\n",

      "     <p>\n",
      "      The nuance to me is yes, but it's more like with the resources of Microsoft and the timeframe that Microsoft can afford to have, they can afford to start building the application, start building the product, getting into market, start learning, be positioned that then when the paradigm shift comes, leap ahead.\n",

People were really generous with their time, pointing us to different resources, explaining their recollection of history as it happened. Being in Seattle, active in the venture community here, both through PSL and David, you're in my shared history at Madrona, me working at Microsoft, a lot of good opportunities to learn what really happened from folks.\n",

It's so great to get his perspective, especially about the early days of Office and the applications group. Very helpful. Similarly, Pete Higgins worked closely with Mike. Pete, I think, ran Excel for a long time and oversaw a lot of the different stuff in the applications group, and I believe also ran Office.\n",

      "      It's funny how many different people picked up the mantle over time as these things traded around groups. But frankly, I think that's a huge part of the Microsoft story.

      "     <p>\n",
      "      Ben: And how different the go to market motions were for Windows and Office. I think Terry was the one that gave us the insight of Windows, especially in the early days. It was basically an OEM game, small group doing an OEM thing.\n",

It was very fun seeing after spending some time talking with Brad and texting a lot with him to see the end of the Windows 95 announcement after Bill and Jay Leno are done for Brad to come out and finish it off. It's fun. It's like watching a time machine, watching that thing is really cool.\n",

There's nobody including Bill Gates that bleeds Microsoft more than Steve Ballmer, and his just unabashed pure pride in what they built is infectious.\n",

      "Microsoft. After nearly a decade of Acquired episodes, we are finally ready to tackle the most valuable company ever created. The company that put a computer on every desk and in every home. The company that invented the software business model. The company that so thoroughly and completely dominated every conceivable competitor that the United States government intervened and kneecapped it…  yet it’s STILL the most valuable company in the world today. This episode tells the story of Microsoft in its heyday, the PC Era. We cover its rise from a teenage dream to the most powerful business and technology force in history — the 20-year period from 1975 to 1995 that took Bill and Paul from the Lakeside high school computer room to launching Windows 95 alongside Jay Leno and the Rolling Stones. From BASIC to DOS, Windows, Office, Intel, IBM, Xerox PARC, Apple, Steve Jobs, Steve Ballmer… it’s all here, and it’s all amazing. Tune in and enjoy… Microsoft.‍\n"

      "David:  What were you listening to before we hopped on to your walkout music?Ben: The new Beyonce.David: The new Beyonce, I haven't heard it yet. How is it?Ben: I really like it.David: Nice.Ben: I think it is reductionist to call it country.David: I was appropriately enough listening to Start Me Up through the ages.Ben: Of course you were. But I feel like a David Rosenthal move is that you might have been listening to Start Me Up whether we were doing Microsoft or not. That's a very squarely in your genre song.David: The Stones though, man, it's crazy. They're in their 70s–80s.Ben: Amazing.David: Man, I hope we're in our 70s and 80s dancing on stage.Ben: Season 126.David: Yeah.Ben: All right, let's do it.David: Let's do it.Ben: Welcome to season 14, episode 4 of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. I'm Ben Gilbert.David: I'm David Rosenthal.Ben: And we are your hosts. We often remark that selling software is the best business model of all time. Today, finally, we tell the story of the company that created that business, Microsoft.David: Finally, we're 10 years into Acquired. We're finally doing it.Ben: It's been daunting. We wanted to do it for a while, but it takes some chutzpah to tackle Microsoft.David: I'm so fired up. We're ready. It's time.Ben: Listeners, Microsoft today is sprawling and massive. It is the world's most valuable company worth over $3 trillion. They have 49 years of history making software for consumers and enterprises, making hardware, gaming systems, gaming studios, Windows apps, iPad apps, Mac apps, operating systems, mobile operating systems, MP3 players, search engines, cloud computing, services on cloud computing, programming languages, development environments, and the list goes on. But it did not start out that way.Today, we will tell the story of the desktop software company. Before the enterprise, before IT, before the Internet, before being a trusted partner to governments around the free world, and really, before people even knew what to do with personal computers, this is the story of a bunch of ragtag geniuses in their 20s pushing what was possible. Welcome to Microsoft, the PC era.Listeners, if you want to know every time an episode drops, you can get hints at the next topic and follow up. You can sign up at acquired.fm/email. Come talk about this episode with the community at acquired.fm/slack. If you want more from David and I, you should check out our second show, ACQ2, where we interview founders, investors, and experts often as a deeper dive into topics we cover on the main show. Before we dive in, we want to briefly thank our presenting sponsor, JP Morgan Payments.David: Yes, just how we say every company has a story, every company's story is powered by payments. JP Morgan Payments is a part of so many journeys from seed to IPO and beyond.Ben: With that, this show is not investment advice. David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss and likely all of you if you hold any index funds, and the show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. David, where on earth do we start the Microsoft story?David: We're right down the middle on this one. We're going to start in 1955 in Seattle, Washington with the birth of Bill Gates III or Trey as he's known growing up. It's so confusing because his dad is the second, but he goes by Senior, and Bill is Junior/III/Trey. Bill is born in 1955 as the second of three children to Bill and Mary Gates. Bill Gates Sr. (his father), is from Bremerton, the Navy town just across the sound from Seattle, where he grows up in a family that owns and runs a furniture store there, a long way from the software king of the world here.Bill Gates Sr./II, after high school, he joins the Army during World War II, serves during World War II, and then he goes, I presume on the GI Bill to the University of Washington, where he's the first member of his family to go to college. There he gets an undergrad and a law degree in four years, and then decides to stay in Seattle with his new family and become a practicing attorney.I say family because at the U-Dub, he meets and marries one Mary Maxwell. Mary, I don't know how to put it other than that she is a force. Mary's family had founded National City Bank, and her father was a senior executive at First Interstate Bank, which later became a big part of Wells Fargo. Mary, despite being the daughter of a successful business family in that day and age, was not cast aside like so many other daughters we've talked about on the show.Ben: New York Times, Hermes, where it was passed to the son-in-law to continue to run the business. That was not the case with Mary Maxwell.David: No. After she graduates from the U-Dub, she becomes first the president of the Seattle Junior League. She starts joining nonprofit boards in Seattle as a very young woman. She joins the Seattle Symphony Board, the Chamber of Commerce, the Children's Hospital, the King County United Way. She's such a force on these boards that she starts getting asked by her fellow board members to join their company's boards too. The corporate boards were so impressed with her.First, she joins the board of First Interstate Bank, the bank that her family's a part of. Then she joins the board of Cairo Television in Seattle. She even ends up joining the Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Board.Ben: That's right, part of the AT&T breakup.David: Yeah. Eventually, she joins the Board of Regents of the University of Washington and the entire national United Way board. She never works full-time in a corporate setting, but it is not an overstatement at all to say that Mary Gates became one of the most powerful business people in the Pacific Northwest, period.Ben: Absolutely, and Bill Gates Sr. was the prominent attorney in the region, so it's quite the power couple.David: Ben, it's like you're reading my script here. Yes. We don't want to give Bill Sr. the short shrift here either. He becomes a superstar lawyer, and he becomes a co-founding partner of the firm Preston, Gates, and Ellis, which today, I didn't even realize until I dug in the research, that is K&L Gates today, one of the largest law firms in the world.Another fun fact that you probably know about Bill Gates Sr., but we got to, this being Acquired, talk about. Do you know what corporate board he joined later in life?Ben: I do not.David: Costco.Ben: Of course, Bill Gates Sr., we should say too, basically galvanized the entrepreneurial community in Seattle. He started the tech alliance. He was a huge angel investor. He really did organize angel investors, people who want to put high risk capital to work into startups. His heart was there, obviously, through his law practice, long before Bill Gates III became the prodigy he became.David: Totally, and that's the point we want to land here. For young Bill, Trey growing up here, he is growing up in a pretty unique household. He would later talk about being 9 or 10 years old. Most nights at dinner at his house, there would be a CEO, a senator, a governor, or somebody who's just over for dinner, and Bill would sit there and absorb the business conversation. It's like the Hermes family, the Dumas family that we talked about in that episode. This whole thing makes me think of Paul, the main character in the Dune movies in the book. He's bred from birth to be this incredible business mind.Ben: At age 13, with his best friend, who we will talk about very soon, he brought up the idea, I wonder what company I will be the CEO of when I grow up. What industry will I go after? What problems will I tackle? It wasn't a question of if, but which.David: Yes. It just turned out that He would be the CEO and founder of the biggest company in the biggest industry ever to exist. The other thing that we got to say about Bill growing up, he is insanely competitive. He did not and does not like to lose at anything. That is putting it mildly, whether it's sports, swimming, computers, school, or the classroom.There's a quote in one of the books we read from a childhood friend of his who says, \"Everything Bill did, he did competitively and never simply to relax.\" I think this used to be more than today. There's this image of Bill Gates that he was a computer nerd, that he was this shy little skinny kid. The way he looks doesn't help this, but that is not the case at all. This guy had a competitive fire in him, I'm sure he still does like none other.Ben: Both things can be true. He was the number one math student in the State of Washington. He was a nerdy kid, a brilliant kid, and also fiercely competitive. His childhood friend and co-founder of Microsoft, Paul Allen, would say about him, “You could tell three things about Bill Gates pretty quickly. He was really smart, he was really competitive, and he wanted to show you how smart he was. And he was really, really persistent.”David: That sounds about right. Famously, speaking of Paul and where Bill and Paul meet, when Bill is in seventh grade, his parents enroll him at the Lakeside School, which now I think is internationally famous because of Bill. It is a super rigorous college prep school, middle school, and high school. Bill ends up writing the scheduling software for class scheduling that he puts himself in the classes with all the girls. Funny.This Bill, 13 years old, seventh grade, Lakeside, this is when it starts. Obviously, Microsoft doesn't start. But during that year, Bill is 13 years old, the Lakeside Mothers Club raises money to buy the school a teletype, connect it up, and rent computer time from a DEC PDP 10 that is located in downtown Seattle and owned by the branch office there of General Electric.Probably a bunch of you are like, I have no idea what any of those words mean, so we got to set some context. This is 1968, the Beatles, Vietnam, the Summer of Love. This is not the computer age.Ben: 2001, A Space Odyssey had just come out.David: Nolan Bushnell has not founded Atari yet. Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore are only just leaving Fairchild Semiconductor to start Intel. Silicon Valley is still dominated by Lockheed. There is no such thing as a microprocessor.Ben: The United States would land on the moon one year later.David: Totally. The way computing worked back then, it was basically still the ENIAC days. A computer meant two things. It either meant a massive room sized machine that had about the computing power of a calculator, or it meant a human. People talked about computers as humans. Have you ever seen the movie Hidden Figures about the black women who did the calculations?Ben: Yes. Those women were the computers.David: They were called the computers, yes.Ben: Because they would sit there and compute.David: This was a totally different era. The idea that a 13-year-old kid in this high school, this middle school would get access to share computer time, I can't imagine there are many other secondary schools in the country that were doing this.Ben: This is a very early place to make the point. Microsoft is the result of tremendous intelligence, brilliant strategy, fierce competition, and an unbelievable amount of luck. Bill Gates was born in 1955, the same year as Steve Jobs, to come into adulthood just as the personal computer wave is starting.The fact that he was at a middle school and had this much privilege, where he could get access to a PDP-10 at this point in his life to help him understand how important computers would become, there are dozens of people in America who are as well-situated as Bill is, and that might be overly generous.David: He and Paul got a sneak peek into the future there at Lakeside. It's funny, you said the personal computer era. We are so far away from the personal computer here. We got us at the stage. What is computing? I mentioned ENIAC and these room-sized things.Computers did not have screens. You didn't have cursors, you didn't have lights, you didn't have pixels. Everything was done on a teletype that looked like typewriters, and they were wired up remotely either in the same facility or what Lakeside is doing. You could be remote. It's almost the cloud today.Ben: And it called over a phone line. That was the teletype.David: Exactly. Got wired over the phone line, hooked up to these mainframes. You typed commands into this teletype, and then the response came back over the phone line or over whatever cable from the mainframe. It got printed out on a spool of tape on the teletype. But this is power that normal 13-year-olds don't come anywhere near accessing.What is the computing market at this time? It is pretty much—we'll come back to the pretty much in a minute—100% dominated by IBM. IBM, Big Blue, Big Iron is what it was referred to, the products that they would produce, were the industry.Ben: Ben Thompson has a fantastic quote on this. He has an article called, What is a Tech Company? And here's his comment. \"Fifty years ago, what is a tech company was an easy question to answer. IBM was the tech company, and everybody else was IBM's customers. That may be a slight exaggeration, but not by much. IBM built the hardware, at that time the System 360, They wrote the software, including the operating system and the application, and provided services including training, ongoing maintenance, and custom line of business software.”David: Yeah, System 360 was a line of solutions, I would say, offered by IBM. It consisted of the room-sized thing, the mainframe, the software, which was system 360, and the consulting and the implementation. You couldn't just call up UPS and forklift one of these things into a company and expect it to work. No, you got to operate this thing too.Ben: Totally, it's like ASML machines. You don't just ship them off to TSMC and say, good luck making semiconductors. It's a full solution, full service thing. But an important thing that was also happening this year, 1968, was that IBM was undergoing some antitrust scrutiny over that huge bundle that I just told you about.Doesn't it smell antitrust? They do everything from the hardware to the software to the operating system, the service, the support. They are the whole market. They're starting to get concerned. Proactively, they unbundled hardware, software, and services. They started selling those separately for the first time, which was not a problem at first. What it did was it cracked the door for customers to say, oh, I can buy hardware from IBM and software from someone else? Other people were not exploiting this, but it was possible.David: Yeah, interesting. It cracks the door for Microsoft 15–20 years later.Ben: Yes, but this is where the seeds are sown of what is the exploitable opportunity when Bill Gates is ready to do something.David: Interesting. Back to the timing thing for Bill, Paul, and Microsoft. I mentioned when we were setting this up that there's something else to talk about here. IBM was facing a disruptive force at this moment, I think, probably for the first time in its history, certainly in the computing era of IBM's history, and that was the Digital Equipment Corporation or DEC. Noticed when we said earlier that Lakeside is renting computer time from the General Electric computer in downtown Seattle, I said it's a deck PDP-10. It's not an IBM product.What's DEC? They're the \"mini\" computer company. Mini meaning it was the size of a closet, not the size of a room. It's all relative. DEC had been started by this guy, Ken Olson from MIT.What they did, he had this brilliant insight that would play out over and over and over again in technology that I'm not going to go compete with IBM head on, I'm not going to make any act. I'm not going to make mainframes.But computing has advanced enough that there's an opportunity to make something smaller, less powerful, more toy-like, and there's enough demand out there that I think they can find some new markets for people who will buy those types of computers and it’s smaller businesses. But in particular, it's branch offices of the big company.I am sure General Electric bought lots and lots and lots of IBM mainframes and products at their headquarters, but the GE field office in Seattle is not going to truck in a mainframe.Ben: And in 1968, Seattle is a provincial little town. I'm standing here right now. It's a major city and a huge economy in the United States. But at the time, a podunk, forgotten, sleepy, faraway place.David: Totally. Microsoft would go a long way to changing that over time.Ben: We should say this is the classic low-end disruption playbook. This is what Clayton Christensen was talking about. Going from mainframe to mini computers, I'm going to make something that's worse for most things, but better for some new things that new customers and new markets are going to care a lot about. IBM's going to look at it and go, that can't do any of the things that are important to our customers. And that's exactly why it works.David: Specifically, why are they not going to care about it? I don't know exactly what an IBM mainframe system, System 360, 370, whatever cost. I'm imagining tens of millions of dollars all in total cost, maybe hundreds of millions of total dollars to run a system like that and buy it.The first DEC machine, when it comes out, the PDP-1, a few years before this time, was priced at $120,000, so an order of magnitude, maybe two below a system that you would buy from IBM. Obviously still a long, long, long way from the personal computer. People are not buying these things for their houses, but GE will buy one for the field office in Seattle, or universities will buy them for research, for their students, for their professors.DEC creates a new market for computing. Bill, he's so studied in business history, the founder, Ken Olson is Bill's hero. He totally looks up to DEC and what DEC's done. The DEC and minicomputer UI is still the same as the mainframe. You're still using a teletype. There's no innovation in terms of what computing is or how you use it. It's just cheaper and more people have access to it.Back to Lakeside and the Mother's Club raising money for this access here for the school, Bill, remember, he's just started. He's in seventh grade, and Lakeside is a middle school in a high school. The high school is actually in a separate building. The computer room that gets installed with the teletypes was over in the high school, but Bill doesn't care. He gets exposed to it in a math class one day and he's like, oh, I'm hooked.He goes over. He's hanging out with the high schoolers, teaches himself how to program, and pretty quickly he becomes known as one of the very best programmers there. He and three other kids form what they call themselves the Lakeside Programmers Group. One of his buddies who he forms it with is of course the high schooler or I think the 10th grader at the time, Paul Allen.Ben: There is a fantastic photo, listeners, that we will tweet of Bill and Paul sitting in the computer room at Lakeside. Bill, I think he's 13–14. He looks like he's about eight. I think on the wall, there's this almost printed out magazine thing that says the bug slayer that they've hung up over the wall. It's amazing.David: These high school kids, they start the Lakeside Programmers Group. They call it the programmers group because they are programmers. This is another super important thing to learn. To use a computer at this time meant to be a programmer. There was no package software that you bought. The software that IBM was selling was the operating system to make the machines actually function, and it was the programming languages that you could then program on but you weren't clicking around and using Excel or pulling up apps. Everybody who used a computer wrote their own software.Ben: Right. There was not this multi-sided network of you've got developers making applications, and then you've got users of those applications. No, everybody who used a computer was a programmer.David: The goal of the Lakeside Programmers Group, remember Bill is this business prodigy, is to use their very valuable and very rare skills as programmers at this time to make money, do a business.It turns out at the same time—the coincidences here are just crazy—there is a local startup coming out of the University of Washington called the Computer Center Corporation or C-Cubed. The business plan behind C-Cubed was that they were going to get a bunch of DECs, a bunch of PDP-8s, PDP-10s, PDP-11s, whatever, and they were going to be AWS. They were going to just be a computer time-sharing company.C-Cubed hires the Lakeside Programmers Group, these kids, to come in and find and document bugs in the system. They're going to pay them directly in computer time. When they come into C-Cubed, they learn Fortran, they learn Lisp, they learn machine language for the PDPs. Back at Lakeside, they were just using BASIC, the programming language.Ben: Which is reasonably high level in terms of how abstract it is. You're not writing machine language. You don't have to know how to address memory, registers, and all that. It reads English, it knows how to add numbers together. It's not an elegant language, and it's a very verbose language. But if you look at it with your eyes as a person who speaks English and knows basic math, you're like, I understand what this program does. There's a meaningful amount of translation done by a BASIC interpreter that takes you from the BASIC code you have to write to what is actually running on the machine.David: Yes, but BASIC, we don't want to give the impression that it is just basic or just for kids.Ben: No, it's widely used.David: It's going to become hugely, hugely important. It is both the gateway programming language for everybody, but it's a real programming language, and a lot of stuff is done in it.Ben: It's the Python of its day. I think the way Python is now where you joke that Python is so flexible, you can accidentally write a program by writing English, it can forgive a lot of mistakes, and it reads English, it's a reasonable parallel to draw it way back when with BASIC where you say, look, you can understand it as a layman, but also it's used in a broad set of business applications.David: Totally. When Bill, Paul, and their buddies come into C-Cubed, they're now getting access to learn real hardcore systems programming languages, including machine code for the PDP-10. They're becoming pretty prolific engineers here.Ben: They're handwriting assembly code.David: And they're getting mentored. One of the executives at C-Cubed is a guy named Steve Russell. Did you find this, Ben? Do you know about this?Ben: No.David: This is amazing. You're going to die. Steve Russell was the guy who wrote Spacewar when he was at MIT on the first PDP, the PDP -1. He's a computer science legend.Ben: Nolan Bushnell told us about that.David: Yes. Spacewar was the first video game, first computer game ever written. It was written as a fun side project by some MIT engineers in the early days of DEC, and then that became Nolan Bushnell's inspiration for starting Atari and Pong. Steve Russell, that guy, he mentored Bill Gates.Ben: Wow, and he was here at the University of Washington?David: He had come out to the University of Washington, and then left and was part of one of the execs starting this company.Ben: C-Cubed, wow. That's a mile from my house.David: Right? Crazy.Ben: Wow.David: After a little while at C-Cubed, all of this real expertise that these kids are getting leads to another opportunity at another timeshare computing company based down in Portland. They ask the kids to write a real piece of software, to write a payroll billing program for all their clients that are using the timeshare system.Bill now, who's the de facto leader of this group, negotiates a deal with the help of his dad, Bill Gates Sr. prolific corporate attorney in Seattle. Rather than just being paid hourly for their time, they're going to get a royalty on the revenue that their client makes off the software. I can't believe it. These kids are teenagers. They're figuring out the whole software business model here.They end up making at least $10,000 from these royalties, which the average household income in the US at the time was below $10,000. These kids are rolling in money. The next year, Paul graduates from Lakeside and goes off to college at Washington State. He and Bill decide to team up on a new venture that they're going to do together called Traf-O-Data.Ben: They've identified a market opportunity, and that opportunity is reducing traffic.David: Yes. The business plan is that municipalities count cars that go through intersections, use that to make decisions about how they're going to do city planning. Bill and Paul are like, we can take this new thing that's coming out of Intel, a microprocessor, which is promising to be a full computer on one chip. We can use that. We can build a machine that is going to be a computer, and it'll process and analyze that data, and then we can sell it to governments. Great, big market.Ben: Listeners, are you sensing what's happening here? Mainframe, mini computer, microprocessor. We have to keep using smaller and smaller words to represent the fact that the computer is getting smaller and smaller here.David: It wasn't until we started doing research for this episode that I finally realized, oh, microcomputers, which is the original term for the personal computer for the PC. It was called microcomputers before PC caught on. They're called microcomputers because they're based on the microprocessor.Ben: Yes, absolutely.David: It's not just that micro is smaller than mini.Ben: It is funny that it stopped there. The computers that are sitting on all of our desks are microcomputers.David: Right. While they're waiting for the AD08, this new first microprocessor from Intel, to come out, or at least for them to get access to it, they want to get a head start on programming their traffic data machine and programming this microprocessor. Paul's like, I got this. I can find a way to make this happen.He takes the PDP-10 at Washington State and he writes a whole emulator program to mimic the instruction set for the AD08 from the manual. They get a full emulator up and running, and they can code even without the microprocessor actually being there. It's just NVIDIA. When Jensen was like, no, we got to build an emulator and simulate this, and then we're going to ship it sight unseen, they're doing the same thing.Ben: It's funny. In many ways, at this point in history, getting a manual was actually much more valuable than getting the processor itself because the processor would arrive. Unless there was documentation, you would have no idea how to interact with it to take advantage of its power.If you had a manual, sure, you couldn't actually test the stuff you wrote for it on the hardware. But if you wrote an emulator on a bigger, more powerful computer that could mimic the computer that you're actually targeting, you could go years before actually ever running the software on the target device and just work off of what the manual says as long as the manual is correct and matches how it actually works.David: And this is going to become very important to Microsoft in just a second. Traffic data is not a huge success. I think I read a few places, they make about $20,000 in revenue from it. Again, great money for high school and college kids, but not world-changing stuff here. This is not what Bill aspires to for the company he's going to start.Bill and Paul are getting experience with the microprocessor. Bill actually has the idea for Microsoft when they're working with it. He's like, oh, this is a computer, why don't I go off and write an interpreter for BASIC here, and we can sell the BASIC interpreter for the microprocessor and build a big business? The AD08 just wasn't powerful enough yet to do that.Ben: But spoiler alert, that totally becomes Microsoft. The seeds of Microsoft are selling language interpreters for new processors, new hardware, new computers that enable you to write familiar programming languages on that new hardware.David: Yup. Bill and Paul are not the only ones having this insight here, too. Another Seattle guy named Gary Kildall who they had intersected with, who they knew from C-Cubed and the University of Washington, had the same idea here. We're going to bring up Gary and his company, Digital Research, a little bit later.Ben: Yeah, he cared a little bit less about programming languages and a little bit more about operating systems. That's how they diverged for the few years here.David: Bill and Paul absolutely see the vision for what this can grow into and become. Bill has a great quote. \"Paul and I had talked about the microprocessor, and it was really his insight that because of semiconductor improvements, things would just keep getting better. I said to him, oh, exponential phenomena are pretty rare, pretty dramatic. Are you serious about this? Because this means, in effect, that we can think of computing as free. It was a gross exaggeration, but it was probably the easiest way to understand what it means to cut costs like that. And Paul was quite convinced of it.\"Ben: Is this in the Smithsonian interview?David: Yes, so good.Ben: It's so good. This quote is incredible because basically, Paul Allen brings up Moore's Law to Bill Gates; they don't use that language there. But in 1971, that is what's happening. For Paul, this is just an observation of hey, there's an exponential thing happening here, it seems like it's going to keep happening, it's been happening.Bill's shaking and he's like, what? Exponential phenomena don't just happen. That's incredibly, incredibly rare and immediately gets Bill's wheels turning on. What does this mean for the world? If that's actually true, we need to act and do something profoundly different than anyone's ever done before because this enables new things that no one ever thought could be possible.David: This moment is the genesis of the vision for Microsoft. Even though Bill doesn't say the words in this quote, the vision of a computer on every desk in every home, that's the famous part that got left off later when the DOJ started sniffing around was running Microsoft software.But that is the vision here, and it is crazy at the time. A computer on every desk and in every home, Bill sees that this is what this exponential phenomenon, what Moore's law means, that that is going to happen. We're still in the era of teletypes. Nobody else sees this.Ben: And it's also the reason why Microsoft is going to form into such a different type of company that's ever come before it, why they can break all the rules, why they can sell just software, even though that's never been a thing before, why their business model can be so much different than everyone else's business model.In preparing for this episode, we got to talk with Pete Higgins, who ran Excel and was an executive overseeing Office for a long time in the early days. He had this great quote to us, which was, \"Computer on every desk was wackadoo stuff. People laughed at it. It was absolutely wild. People thought, I don't know, maybe 1 in 10 people in their finance group or something will have one at some point. This is the profoundness of an exponential decrease in price or increase in power of computing. It's going to become universal.\"David: All that said, even Bill and Paul know the AD08. It's not there yet. It's not powerful enough to really be a general-purpose computer on a chip, but they know it's coming. In the fall of 1973, Bill goes off to college at Harvard famously. It's funny, at Harvard, like Jim Simons that we talked about at MIT on the RenTech episode. Bill thinks he's going to be a world-class mathematician and set the world on fire.Ben: It's literally a quote from Paul Allen. Bill was the number one math student in the state of Washington. He gets there, and he does this theoretical math class, math 55 and gets a B. Paul says, when it came to higher mathematics, he might've been one in a hundred thousand or better, but there were people who were one in a million or one in 10 million. And some of them wound up at Harvard. Bill would never be the smartest guy in the room, and I think that hurt his motivation. He eventually switched his major to applied math.David: Yes. While Bill's at Harvard, he's also doing a bunch of the typical college kid stuff. He's playing poker, he's cutting classes, he's making friends. One of the friends he makes there is a kid down the hall from him named Steve Ballmer. Everybody knows Ballmer. He's everything that Bill is not. He's super social, he's super outgoing. He's in a final club, which is a big thing in the social scene at Harvard.Ben: He's gregarious. Anyone who's ever met Steve or seen a video of Steve, you are well aware that this man has a presence. But the thing that people don't know about him is he is so unbelievably analytical. Steve is the guy that outscored Bill Gates on the Putnam exam.David: Which is the annual math competition for college students.Ben: Yeah, Steve isn't a programmer, but he is every bit the mathematician that Bill Gates is. That is one of these things where I think when people try to set it up as well, you've got the brilliant programmer genius and the marketing guy, it's just like those are the roles they took. But I think when you're getting a sense of who the original crew was at Microsoft, they were all brainiacs, and they were all wildly analytical.David: Totally. In the spring of 1974, Bill's freshman year, Electronics Magazine publishes big news about a new Intel chip, the next generation, the next turn of the crank on Moore's Law, the 8080. In Bill's words here, all at once, we were looking at the heart of a real computer, and the price was under $200. We attacked the manual. I told Paul, DEC can't sell any more PDP-8s now. It seemed obvious to us that if a tiny chip could get so much more powerful, the end of big unwieldy machines was coming.Ben: Yup. This is really where Bill Gates commits to computers to be his life's work. I think what's often lost in the story is Bill, even though he was good at computers and spent tons of time programming computers, never fancied himself a computer guy until this moment in history. He went to Harvard because he felt, hey, if I ever want to be a lawyer or something else, they've got a lot of great programs there. This was the moment where I think it really clicked for him that I'm just in the middle of the right place at the right time with the right skill set, and this is my way of having the most impact on the world.David: They think, okay, what's clearly going to happen here is all the big computer companies, IBM, DEC, the big Japanese computing companies, they see this. They're going to get into this business, they're going to make machines, and they're going to make microcomputers. Surely, they will jump on this opportunity, right?Ben: If it didn't destroy their existing business model, sure they would.David: Exactly. Bill and Paul are sitting around waiting through 1974 and 1975 being like, hey, when are the 8080 computers going to come out? Where are they? It's just crickets. Paul is so convinced that the revolution is coming that he actually drops out of Washington State, moves to Boston to be close to Bill so that they can be ready when it happens. That summer, they both get summer jobs at Honeywell as programmers. Paul stays on into the next school year when Bill goes back to school. He's just waiting, waiting, waiting.In December 1974, Paul is walking across Harvard Square, and he sees in a newsstand the January issue of Popular Electronics, on whose cover is the Altair 8800, the world's first real honest-to-God commercially available for sale microcomputer. The legend has it that Paul grabs the magazine, runs over to Bill's dorm, throws open the door, throws the magazine on the desk, and is like, it's here. Bill's just says, oh, my God, it's happening without us. We need to get on this right now.Ben: It's so funny he thinks they're already behind because clearly they're not. History would show. I think Bill Gates even says, we might've actually started a year or two too early. The market actually hadn't materialized yet. The funniest thing is, the starting gun went off, Bill and Paul ran, and everyone else is still standing around.David: This is it. This is the moment. The revolution is here. Microsoft is about to be founded. But first, this is a great time to thank our presenting partner this season, JP Morgan Payments.Ben: Just like Bill's vision of Microsoft to put a computer on every desk and in every home, JP Morgan has a vision for making payments real time, 24/7 everywhere and in every currency. JP Morgan has experienced a massive digital transformation, and is now much more than just a global bank. They invest $15 billion a year into technology and R&D. With JP Morgan Payments, you are getting their history of service, stability, and scale, but also innovation and new technology.David: Scale is really the key word here. Every episode, we talk about Hamilton Helmer's seven powers, and boy, does JP Morgan have scale economies. What's unique about their position in payments is that they can make massive infrastructure investments that benefit their customers in the near term, in addition to the long-term technology bets like blockchain or quantum computing. Since they move $10 trillion a day in 160 countries, these investments create a lot of shared value across their large customer base.Ben: Yeah, not to mention the second of the Seven Powers' network economies.David: Yup. If you're a JP Morgan payments customer, whether you're a startup or a Fortune 500, you can access their payments partner network. This is a set of third party integrations across virtually every industry and payment use case. It makes it easy to discover what specific set of tools are best for your business.Ben: It's basically a B2B marketplace that connects their clients with the broader payments and technology ecosystem such as treasury management systems, ERPs, point of sale hardware solutions, payment gateways, and so much more. Given JP Morgan's scale, you can imagine the value that comes with unlocking access to their industry leading partners and technology.David: Let's take Visa, for example, which listeners may remember. We talked a lot on that episode about the power of a network. Visa works with JP Morgan to provide global payment processing services. Now through the partner network, you can easily add Visa as an acceptance method through a streamlined implementation with consolidated reporting. Other companies in the partner network include Oracle, American Express, MasterCard, Accenture, and many more including friends of the show, Modern Treasury.Ben: Across any industry, the most successful companies we've talked about are the ones who think and invest strategically through a long-term lens. Like Hermes, durability and reliability are paramount for building hundred year companies that can reinvent and continue to grow. That is the case for JP Morgan Payments. Their history of trusted solutions and investments in technology bring clients and new fintech companies together to drive innovation and growth for businesses of all sizes.David: Before we jump back into Bill and Microsoft, who essentially wrote the modern playbook on building platforms, be sure to check out jpmorgan.com/acquired or click on the link in the show notes.Ben: David, they're like, it's happening without us. What do they do?David: They do the natural thing that two super excited, ambitious, high octane college kids would do. They call up the main phone number of Altair's manufacturer, a company called MITS and ask for the president, a man named Ed Roberts. Bill and Paul get them on the phone and they say, we have a BASIC interpreter, ready to go, ready to ship, for the 8080 Intel chip, and we want to provide it for you, for your machine.Ben: Of course they don't.David: They don't have a single letter of code written. They don't have anything.Ben: It's a market test. They want to know what's the response if this were true.David: Exactly. Ed's a bit of a character himself. He says, okay, well, guys, a lot of other people are calling me and saying the same thing. What I'm telling them, and I'm going to tell you too, is that anybody who can come here to my office in Albuquerque, New Mexico and demonstrate a working version of BASIC on my Altair will get a contract with us to distribute it when they go on sale. Bill and Paul say, okay, great, we'll see you soon, and hang up. By ‘see you soon,’ they mean, ‘let's go get to work.’Ben: This is a big deal for MITS too if this works, because right now they've just announced a machine for which you can't really do anything on it. The hardware is powerful, but they're not going to have a lot of customers unless there's stuff you can do on the machine. A BASIC interpreter running on it, it's quite valuable to then make the claim you can program BASIC on our computer. They're very excited about this, even though they're playing coy.David: I was going to talk about this in a minute, but let's talk about what the Altair is. What did they just announce in the magazine here? The Altair is the first mass market commercially available personal computer.Ben: Again, no screen or anything.David: Yeah. Does not have a screen, does not have a keyboard, doesn't have a display of any kind. What it does have is it has a set of 16 lights on the front of the machine, Christmas lights and 16 switches. You can flip the switches to flip bits, and then the machine will respond by lighting up different patterns of lights. It doesn't come with any software. There's nothing. That's all it is, 16 lights, 16 switches.Ben: In order to use it, you got to hook up your own teletype, you got to get the manual, you got to hope that the manual is right, and you got to code to the machine instructions, literally the assembly language for the chip inside for the Intel 8080.David: Back to the Traf-O-Data days and Paul writing the emulator for the 8008 at Washington State, Paul's like, we got this. I'll just write an emulator on the Harvard PDP-10 for the 8080 instruction set.Ben: He does the same thing again. They get the manual, they have an emulator, and they write it against an emulator.David: Yup. Bill writes the BASIC interpreter. In a couple of weeks, they've got it working. Ed's like, okay, come on out to Albuquerque. Bill and Paul—remember, Bill still looks he's 12 at this point in time—decide that just Paul should go.Ben: Does Paul have a rocking beard at this point yet?David: Paul is super 70s. He is into it. As we'll see, he's going to fit right in at Albuquerque and MITS. Paul gets on a plane, flies from Boston to Albuquerque. In a total epic legend moment, they didn't have a bootloader written for the BASIC interpreter.They had the BASIC, it was all written, they'd done it on the emulator, and Paul's flying out with the computer tape with the code of the BASIC interpreter on it. He's like, oh, shoot, we can't just feed that right into the machine. There's got to be a bootloader to load up this thing. He writes the bootloader on the plane.Ben: On paper, by hand, he is hand coding octal, not even assembly language instructions. He's hand coding in pure octal the instructions to load their BASIC interpreter program into memory.David: Yup. He lands in Albuquerque, drives out to MITS. They load the bootloader onto the prototype Altair there that loads up the BASIC interpreter, and it fails. It doesn't work. Paul's like, oh, shoot, let's try it again. Let's try it again. They try it again. This is how early computing is. It works the second. Who knows what the bug was the first time. They didn't change anything, it just didn't work the first time, and it worked the second time.It loads up, Paul writes in the instructions, print two plus two. It spits out four—by spits out, I mean the lights light up and say four. Both he and Ed, their jaws are on the floor. Paul's like, oh, my God, the BASIC works. Ed's like, oh, my God, the Altair works. Neither of them believed this was actually going to work.Ben: Ed actually has more eggs in this basket than he let on because when Bill and Paul call and say, hey, can you give us the teletype instructions, he reveals they're actually the only ones who called about that. Everyone else who said they were writing a BASIC never got far enough to ask, how do we actually interact with your computer?David: Yes. Now is the time to say a few words about Ed and MITS. What is this company? Bill and Paul originally thought that it was going to be the IBMs, the DECs, the Japanese companies who are going to make the first microcomputers. MITS is about as far away from IBM as you can possibly imagine. MITS basically was a model rocket company.Ben: Which, Albuquerque is a great place to do that.David: Ed Roberts, the founder, had been in the Air Force and stationed in Albuquerque. That's how he got involved in model rocketry. The reason that they're introducing the Altair and they made this big Splash in the magazine was this is a last ditch gambit to try and save the company. You got a bankrupt model rocketry company.Ben: Their little gambit worked and got a couple of college kids to pounce.David: Totally. Why did it work? They had two things going for them that really, Ed, I think probably personally made happen. (1) They got this splashy popular electronics magazine cover that was through a relationship that Ed had. (2) The sticker price was $397, which is about $2300 in 2024 dollars. Yes, that's a lot of money, but the next cheapest computer that anybody could buy at this point in time was a DEC, a $120,000 mini computer. The idea that somebody could buy a computer for $400, I don't care who's selling that thing, I want that.Ben: What did they get, some sweet deal from Intel?David: Yes. This is all Ed's doing. The list price from Intel for the 8080 chip was $360. I think this is part of what was deterring the market of how would anybody sell a kit that was affordably priced when so much of the cost of goods would go to Intel with the processor deal. He managed to negotiate a volume deal with Intel to get 8080 chips at $75 a pop. That was the key unlock.Ben: That's a 5X price reduction.David: Totally. I wasn't able to find how that negotiation went down or why Ed Roberts in Albuquerque, New Mexico got this sweetheart deal from Intel.Ben: Either the list price is wildly wrong, or they were cutting deals all over the place. One thing it could have been is just that, and I'm totally speculating, but chips are the ultimate high fixed cost investment, low marginal costs next to software.You could imagine maybe Intel had already put all the money into the fixed costs of spinning up the fabs and was expecting a certain amount of market demand, and they weren't seeing it. They were like, crap, we've got to recoup our investment. I don't know, lower the price, let them just sell. Maybe we'll make it up in volume.David: I like that. I have no idea, but that's a totally viable train of thought here. Either way, he gets the sweetheart deal. Not only does it make computer history and enable and create Microsoft, it saves the company of MITS.They were on the edge of bankruptcy. After the popular electronics article comes out, they get 4000 pre-orders in the first month or two, which is $1.5 million in revenue, cash paid upfront. That is pure cash hitting the bank account.Ben: That will save a company.David: And also just proves 4000 people just paid cash sight unseen for 16 lights and switches. There's a lot of demand for a home computer here.Ben: At decent margins too, if they're getting the processor for $72, and they're selling it for what did you say?David: $397.Ben: Everything else in there is much cheaper than the processor, so I don't know. Depending on how much they have to give to the sales channel they're selling through, if it's retail or distributors.David: I think they're selling direct. I think people are just sending money orders.Ben: It's a decent margin business. Unlike what the PC business would become over time, they managed to have nice margins.David: Paul and Ed hit it off. Paul decides to move out to Albuquerque to be close to the action here. He actually joins MITS as their vice president of Software. He's vice president of a software department of one. He is the software department here.Ben: Yeah, software department of one, but he's got his buddy Bill Gates who is not employed, but Bill's definitely working on software for the Altar as well.David: Yes. Bill stays at Harvard, but keeps cranking on enhancing the BASIC interpreter and adding more functions and functionality to the version of BASIC that they had just written for the Altair. Once the school year is over, he comes out to Albuquerque for the summer.The Altair is getting ready to ship with the Microsoft BASIC included in it. Bill and Paul need to set up a company, but Paul is an employee of MITS at this point, so what did they do? They set up a partnership. The founding of Microsoft, at this point Micro-Soft, is a two-person partnership between Bill and Paul.Ben: As we record this, that was 49 years and one day ago. We are sitting here on April 5th recording. That was April 4th, 1975. It is very funny to look back at some of the original signatures when Bill writes on letters. It's Bill Gates, the general partner of Micro-Soft, which is great. I think it's actually a Paul Allen name where he wants to put together microcomputer and software. Bill's like, that's perfect, we're immediately just going to run with it. As it was a partnership, originally, they were going to call it something like Allen and Gates, and then they ultimately are like, no, Micro-Soft is perfect.David: Microsoft has become Kleenex. Microsoft means microprocessor software.Ben: I will say it's a nice clarifying North Star because it really draws the line in the sand and says, we're in the software business. Gates makes this really clear to Paul Allen, who is often tempted to do hardware stuff. Bill is very hardcore about saying, no, what we're uniquely good at in the world is software and we should stick to that.I also suspect Bill is starting to realize that there's an amazing business model here if we can pull it off, where we don't have to make the hardware, and we can charge for every copy of the software sold. But that insight, I would say, has not yet fully materialized.David: Let's talk about business model here in one sec. First though on the partnership. Again, we've been saying all along that Bill is clearly the leader here. They set up the partnership. Initially, it's 60/40 ownership, Bill is 60%, Paul is 40%. Later, it gets changed to Bill is 64% and Paul is 36%. Yup, Bill is the leader here.Ben: Bill's case that he makes on that to Paul is, hey, you took a job and you were doing this on the side, I was all in. Paul's an agreeable guy, and 36% is still a nice percent, so he says, sure.David: In the long run here, everybody gets nuts. It's all a rounding error, but to that point back to the business model. Once the partnership is set up, they sign an exclusive licensing arrangement with MITS. This is super important. This is a big lesson that young Bill and Paul are going to learn here.MITS gets exclusive license to the BASIC interpreter to the BASIC as they call it for the 8080. MITS is the one that can then decide whether to sublicense the BASIC out to other companies or not.Essentially, this is a distribution deal with MITS, where MITS becomes the exclusive seller and distributor of Microsoft's BASIC. Microsoft doesn't have any direct sales control here, and it's going to become a big, big, big issue. The terms of the deal are Microsoft is to get $30 for each copy of BASIC that MITS sells plus 50% of the revenue that comes from the sublicensing deals that MITS may or may not do with other companies who want to use the BASIC.Ben: Why would they ever do any sublicensing deals? Why would you give it to your competitors?David: That is a really good question, Ben.Ben: Let's just round that part of the revenue to zero.David: Yeah. This is a big, big, big divergence of interest between Microsoft and MITS. The kicker on this contract is that the total amount of lifetime revenue that Microsoft can make from the BASIC from MITS is capped at $180,000. Ed admits really has the upper hand in this deal.Ben: Or phrased another way, we will give you $180,000 for you to hand over exclusive rights to all that cool BASIC stuff you just wrote to us. But if we sell fewer than X machines, we're actually going to pay it out to you on a prorated basis at $30 a pop rather than giving you the full $180,000.David: That is another way to frame it. Definitely, a great deal for MITS. On the other hand, what are Bill and Paul going to do here?Ben: Right, a great deal for them too given the position they're in.David: Right, MITS is the industry. There is one very, very important clause in the contract though, protecting Microsoft's interests. That clause is that MITS must use its best efforts to license, promote, and commercialize the BASIC broadly in the marketplace. Any failure to do so by MITS would be grounds for termination of the contract by Microsoft.Ben: Thank God, Bill's dad is a lawyer.David: Indeed. The Altair comes out for sale later in 1975. Microsoft does $16,000 in revenue that year from their $30 a pop, the BASICs that are getting sold with the Altair, which is great, especially the first year that they're starting.The next year in 1976, everybody's so excited about this new market, the vision that's happening, the demand, the Altair, the sales that Paul Allen resigns from MITS to join Microsoft full-time. Bill drops out of Harvard officially. He moves to Albuquerque. They're all in on this. But for the year in 1976, Microsoft's revenue is still only $22,000. It was $16,000 the year before, $22,000 in 1976.Ben: Not a high growth company.David: This is less than they were making in high school. What is going on here? (1) MITS is the one at the controls of sales, not Microsoft. (2) MITS is selling a thousand computers a month. This is taking off. This is creating a new industry. Despite MITS selling thousands of computers a month, only a few hundred copies of BASIC are selling per month. What's going on? People are pirating the software. This is the discovery of software piracy.Ben: This is a pretty interesting time to pause and say, are they pirating software?David: That's a good question.Ben: This is 1975. Piracy implies that you are running afoul of some particular legal protection for the good. You might say, well, with today's legal frameworks in hindsight, you would say, of course, if they're copying the software and not paying the money for it, it's piracy. That was actually not established yet. This is the craziest thing. Bill basically has an opinion that it's piracy, and he writes letters to the computer community.David: He writes an open letter to hobbyists.Ben: Yes, and tries to basically guilt trip people. He tries to use that as a recruiting method and say, if you're so excited about pirating our software, maybe you should just come work with us. Nothing would make me happier than making the best software in the world, and please join us on this mission. But ultimately, the legal standing that he has to say, hey, what you're doing is illegal, is not fully established.It would actually take a couple of years for the courts to look at software and say, what about this is protectable? If you think about it, it is a little bit weird. You've got source code that looks like English, BASIC, it's letters and numbers. It gets translated to machine code. That machine code ends up running, and it's basically electrons. It's voltages that are flipped up and down. What about that are we trying to protect?Ultimately, the way it gets litigated through some case law from court cases is that the source code is a copyrightable, creative work that is expressed through some tangible medium. That's the important thing about copyright law. It's a creative work expressed through a tangible medium. A book, the creative work is the words and the tangible medium is printed on paper.With software, it actually took until 1980. Congress changed the law. We'll put a link in the show notes to the literal congressional change that happened. It is in Title 17, Copyrights Chapter 1, Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright. In 1980, they include a defined term, which is a \"computer program is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.” Once you have that passed by Congress codified into law, you now have the standing legal framework that all the whole computer industry used going forward, in particular, the software industry, a computer program is copyrightable work.David: Wow, I didn't know all, that's awesome.Ben: It's totally crazy how recent that is. But when you think about it, why would that have any legal…? Software is such an abstract idea. Before, the whole business model of computers was good luck just replicating an IBM PC and everything that comes with it. You don't need any legal standing. But if you're going to pursue this software only business model, what's the protection around your abstract product?David: That's exactly what I was going to say here. This is the other element of what's going on. This is the first time software has ever been sold. Other than the IBM accounting machinations to protect themselves from antitrust, which was just accounting, nobody had ever sold software before. This is the first time.Ben: Certainly to build a legitimate business around it. The other thing that's useful to know is when you're selling an IBM PC, you're literally selling a PC to a customer the same way that when I'm selling you this glass. From crate and barrel, I am selling you the glass, and the glass is now yours. I've transferred property to you.Software is not that, so the whole world of software is built on a license agreement. The source code that computer program the actual right of that is retained by the creator, and you license the copyright to your customer to be able to use that on their machine.There's this dual idea that computer software is copyrightable, and you can grant a license under certain conditions for customers to use it. That is the legal framework for which the next 50 years of technology at large would operate under.David: For the moment though...Ben: They have a piracy problem.David: Right. The law isn't going to change until 1980. Microsoft would be dead if they didn't figure out a solution to this before 1980. This is when Bill ultimately realizes, shoot, we did the wrong business deal with MITS here. MITS has to sell, and customers have to make the decision buy our BASIC. It's a key critical part of the value of the computer. It's the whole thing.Ben: It makes that machine useful.David: Without it, it is not useful. It's totally setting up the wrong incentives and value equation that customers should be buying this themselves. It should be included by the hardware OEM in the machine that they are selling and in the total purchase price. If that happens, We no longer have a piracy problem because we're just getting paid as part of the purchase of the machine.Ben: Right, it should be a royalty.David: Right. The problem is that is not the deal that they had with MITS.Ben: Right, or framed differently. Instead of saying, hey, consumer, do you want to buy something else too and make a new purchase decision, they should be saying, hey computer manufacturer, we make your thing actually useful, so pay us for it.David: Yes. During 1975 and 1976, MITS pretty much had this new microcomputer market all to themselves. There were a couple of other competitors who sprung up, but nothing made. The Altair and MITS was the microcomputer company.All that changes, though, in a big way in 1977, when what Byte Magazine calls the 1977 Trinity hits the market. That is three machines, the Tandy/RadioShack TRS-80, the Commodore Personal Electronic Transactor, or the acronym PET, and the Apple II. All three of which machines were like the Altair, low cost, mass market.Unlike the Altair, they were not kits. They were fully assembled, fully functional, right out of the box, and they each had their own major distribution advantages. In Bill's words, these three machines, the 1977 Trinity, ignite volume in the market. Bill loves these really dramatic verbs like we attacked the manual, they ignite the volume in the market.Ben: The press just latches on to him. Whenever Bill has a leaked memo or something where he talks about all this war terminology, those all become headlines.David: It's so great. Earlier, during 1976, Microsoft had started getting approached by a few of the bigger computing companies NCR (National Cash Register), GE, Control Data Systems. I want to license Microsoft BASIC for the 8080 microprocessor here so that we can experiment with these things. Each of these deals would have been revenue to Microsoft of $100,000-ish.Ed and MITS, they keep dragging their feet on negotiating these. They've got the exclusive license. Everything's got to go through MITS. Most of them are turning down because Ben, you said, they don't want anybody to come in and compete with them.Ben: Yup, there's the misaligned incentive.David: There's the misaligned incentive. There is the clause that Bill and Microsoft, and I presume Bill Sr. put in the original agreement—is MITS is using its best efforts to commercialize the BASIC and gain adoption in the market? You can make a pretty strong argument that they're not.Ed, though, unbeknownst to Bill and Paul, has another reason that he's dragging his feet on these deals, which is that he's about to sell the company. In May of 1977, MITS gets acquired by the tape drive manufacturer, Pertec, for $6.5 million. Ed rides off into the sunset.Pertec knows about this dispute with Microsoft, and they come in and they figure, who is this Bill Gates? He's a 21-year-old kid, a college dropout, we're a big company, we can deal with this. Robert says an amazing quote later. He says, \"Pertec kept telling me they could deal with this kid. It was a little Roosevelt telling Churchill that he could deal with Stalin.\"Ben: Oh, my God.David: I also don't think they realized that this kid's dad is one of the best corporate attorneys in the country.Ben: Bill Gates was just constantly underestimated, which worked to his advantage in those early days.David: Totally.Ben: This is the thing about Microsoft. People forget how insanely young Bill was. He was just 20. To put that in context, he's only 7 years older than Jensen Huang, but they feel an entire generation apart since Microsoft was started almost 20 years before NVIDIA. When you start bending your mind around like, oh, Bill Gates is still pretty young, considering what an institution Microsoft has become in the world.David: Right. Microsoft next year is going to have its 50th anniversary. I believe that'll also be the same year that Bill turns 70. That's wild.Ben: Yeah.David: That fall in 1977. The dispute between MITS/Pertec and Microsoft goes to arbitration in Albuquerque. The interim months while this arbitration is happening are the only moment in Microsoft's history where cash gets tight. They're running out of money because they can't really make any sales here.Ben: They don't control their destiny.David: People aren't paying MITS for the BASIC. They're \"pirating\" the software. They can't do deals with all the other computer companies that want to come licensed directly, so things get a little tight. Microsoft ends up winning the arbitration, I believe, in maybe November 1977, meaning they are now totally free to license BASIC to anybody who wants to buy it on any terms that they want.They turn around. They immediately license it to Trinity, Apple, Commodore, Radio Shack, and Tandy. They license it to all the big companies, the GEs, the NCRs, who want to experiment with microcomputers.There's a really funny story with Apple that apparently, Woz had more or less written 95% of their own BASIC. But it didn't have floating point numbers, it only had integer numbers. Jobs is totally writing Woz. He's like, the BASIC is really important. Can you just finish it? Can you do floating point? Woz just doesn't do it, so Jobs has to go license Microsoft's BASIC. Amazing.Ben: That's the first deal that happens between the companies. There's so many deals done, both directions, commercial deals, equity deals, legal disputes in both directions. This is the very first time that they do something together.David: Yup. Bill, Paul, and Microsoft, do all these deals. They do them all as cash upfront, fixed cost, all you companies, you're going to pay us. You include the BASIC in the machines that you're selling, and we're going to get all the money up front. Super presciently, though, Bill does not value maximize on these deals.The Apple deal is $31,000 for eight years of access for Apple for the Apple II Microsoft's BASIC. They're not price gouging here because Bill sees, he's like, the play here is we want to make it a no brainer for everybody who's selling a microcomputer to have Microsoft's BASIC on it, because we want to set the standard.If we are the standard programming environment that anybody who's using these computers—and again, anybody who is using these computers is programming them, they're used to the Microsoft version of BASIC—we're going to have so much power that it'll become a self-fulfilling prophecy. All of our competitors will just wither away. Nobody will want them because it's not going to be compatible with the language everybody knows. Once people start trading and then ultimately developing and selling software that they've written, it's only going to run on our BASIC interpreter, not anybody else's.Ben: Fascinating. I actually didn't know that it started this early. One correction there, you don't know for a fact it's only going to run on Microsoft's BASIC interpreter, but you do know for a fact that it will run on Microsoft's BASIC interpreter. If it's cheap enough, why would you take the chance on a clone that might have one or two things wrong with it?David: Yes. Basically, his vision is, I want to remove any oxygen from any argument anyone could have about not using Microsoft's BASIC on a microcomputer. He thinks about this concept as a positive spiral that he really in his mind is the reason for Microsoft's success.He says, “Success reinforces success. In a growing market, one way of doing something gets a slight advantage over its competitors, this is most likely to happen with high technology products that can be made in great volume for a very little increase in cost.” If you get that slight advantage, it'll compound, and this is what he's playing for here.Ben: It's interesting. In the earliest days, what was stopping someone else from writing a BASIC interpreter and licensing it to Apple or RadioShack? Nothing. There were other smart people out there. It was just a very good business decision to say, we got to close that door. We just got to make this a no-brainer for people to buy from us, because if we're value maximizing and it's starting to feel expensive, they're going to turn elsewhere until we get a lead.David: The Apple story is the perfect example. The Woz thing is cute, it makes for a good story, and oh, he didn't finish the BASIC. But when Microsoft sold them the BASIC, which was already getting established as the standard for $31,000...Ben: Sure. Why not?David: No brainer. Apple could have gone out and hired another programmer to finish the BASIC. They're like, wait, we could do that, or I could just get the standard one for $31,000. I'm going to do that.Ben: Just because it's important to establish there are trade offs for everything, if you're running a startup right now, you might think to yourself, oh, great. I'll just run that exact strategy. The important thing here is (a) Most of the work was already done for the original BASIC. (b) Bill was doing it himself, Bill and Paul, so the importance of technical co-founders. Their overhead was crazy low.They could do these deals where they don't make very much money. I think at the end of 1977, there were five employees. Their overhead was just so unbelievably low that they could take a really long lens.David: Even though it takes until the very end of 1977 when the MITS dispute gets resolved and Microsoft can actually make money again, they end 1977 with $381,000 in revenue, despite zero for the first 11 months of the year. They're just rolling in cash. This is when Bill famously goes out and buys a green Porsche 911 and is motoring around Albuquerque, getting all sorts of speeding tickets and hilarious stuff.Ben: This is when he got his mugshot, right?David: Yeah, I think that's right.Ben: This is the classic Bill Gates holding up the...David: Yes. Amazing.Ben: He got, I think, three speeding tickets in one day, two of which were from the same police officer.David: Yeah, and there are funny stories of the Albuquerque police thought, how is a kid driving a Porsche 911? He must be a drug dealer or something.Ben: Even when he was 20–21, he looked 17.David: Right. It's like, do you even have a driver's license?Ben: Wild.David: Back to what you're saying, it's a really, really important point. To make this dynamic work, you need to be able to afford the investment in the fixed cost for the software, for the technology to make it that little bit superior, like Bill's talking about, the slight advantage over the competitors. At this moment in time, the industry is completely brand new. The software industry is brand new.The amount that that fixed costs takes, the cost is quite low. Really, it's just Bill and Paul's time and dedication to this industry that nobody else is making that investment. You can't run this playbook today because in any market, even a brand new market, even a speculative market, the minimum viable fixed cost is billions of dollars.Ben: Right. Yeah, that's interesting. I also think this moment galvanized something important, which is Bill and Paul could look around and see that there is going to be so much value created by microcomputers and by software. They really found religion around software is magic. The things that people can create now that we've done this BASIC interpreter and these machines are cheap and plentiful. The magic will take care of itself as long as we ensure this industry can just exist and do its thing.They flipped from this mode of we need to bite and scratch and claw, and make sure that we win in deals to, huh, how can we enable software as a thing to thrive? I'm sure we can position ourselves well to capture some or a lot of that. I think they became almost stewards of the software industry and evangelists from this point forward.David: Yes. They also do another really prescient thing the next year in 1978, which is they go global.Ben: Yes.David: Nobody else is going global yet, and the way that this happens is so fun. Bill gets a call one day.Ben: Also, how crazy is it? You've got five people, you're operating out of Albuquerque, you just finally expanded from having one customer, and you're like, you know what we should do this year? Let's open in Japan and become an international company.David: Yes. The way this happens is one day, Bill gets a call from a guy named Kazuhiko Nishi, or Kay Nishi, who's a computer enthusiast in Japan, has gotten a hold of Microsoft BASIC, and totally shares the same vision as Bill and Paul. He doesn't have a Paul nor is he technical himself.He's like, I'm going to bring you guys to Japan. I'm going to bring you to all the big computer companies. They agree that Kay will become Microsoft's exclusive distribution partner in Japan. By the next year in 1979, half of Microsoft's revenue is coming from Japan, which is wild.Ben: It's unbelievable, and it stayed at that very high run rate of an international being a huge chunk, close to half always basically forever. This is a huge cornerstone of Microsoft's success that they were an international company from year three of their existence.David: Totally. Revenue in 1977, that last month of revenue was almost $400,000. 1978 revenue is $1.3 million.Ben: They have 13 employees at this point.David: In 1979, revenue is $2.4 million. At the end of that year, they're like, all right, we got to get out of Albuquerque.Ben: They've got 25 employees, I believe, at that point.David: Yeah, something like that. This is when they moved to Seattle. It's interesting to hear Bill talk about this. He actually really liked Albuquerque. Specifically, there weren't any distractions there.Ben: No distractions, weather was great.David: Everybody was happy there, but the big problem was recruiting. He's like, if we're going to build this into the opportunity that I see, the vision that I see and that Paul shares with me, there's no way we're going to do that in Albuquerque. We got to move to a hub.Ben: He's got three reasons for why Seattle in particular. By the way, it worked. Every single person except for his secretary did make the move. (1) He grew up in Seattle. He's like, I just want to go home. He justifies it in two other ways, which I found pretty fascinating. This is from an interview in the early 90s that he did.He said it basically came down to Seattle or Silicon Valley. In Silicon Valley, it's hard to keep secrets because there's a rumor mill. In Seattle, we can be a little bit more removed, and we can announce things when we want to announce them.(2) In Silicon Valley, people switch around companies. I don't want that. I want people to just work at Microsoft. There was a disadvantage to not being able to recruit from your competitors, but for a while, they were really the only game in town in Seattle.David: But not really, though, because pretty quickly, Microsoft is such an important part of the industry. They recruit from Silicon Valley, too. We're going to talk about some of the people who come up. You're totally right, people stay at Microsoft. They don't leave. This continues right through to this day.The other thing that I think is really important to say that makes it work for Seattle in a way that I don't know that this could have worked in too many other places in the country is the University of Washington. The computer science department there was really good. There were great people. Steve Russell had come out there. There was real talent, and they were churning out graduates out of the U-Dub that would go on to populate Microsoft for decades to come.Ben: Bill, of course, reinvested in that flywheel, donating tons of money to the university. There are buildings, there are whole new schools.David: Yes, absolutely. They played right into it.Ben: Today, it's always a top 10, if not top 5 computer science program in the country. But unlike other top computer science programs, it's a state school, so it just has huge volumes. I think more students come out of the University of Washington and go to big tech than any other program in the country. That has stayed this amazing advantage.David: Yeah. I think the only thing even close to it is Berkeley in the Bay Area with a lot of the same dynamics. But there's Stanford there too, so it's a dual university system in the Bay Area. You cannot overstate how important the University of Washington was to this decision and an ultimate success of coming to Seattle.This brings us to 1980 in the beginning of the year when they move to Seattle, just in time for, I think you can make a very strong argument, the single most important deal ever done in the history of technology. It's crazy to even say it now, the Microsoft-IBM PC partnership.Ben: It's crazy. You have this absolute behemoth partnering with someone that's not really relevant. If you're standing here today, it sounds like I'm talking about Microsoft partnering with IBM. At the time, it was IBM partnering with Microsoft. It was the only computer company that mattered in the entire world, got themselves into a particular situation where they came to Microsoft looking for help. It's the craziest set of events that made this possible, and I can't wait to dive into it.David: Me too. Before we do, this is the perfect time to talk about another one of our favorite enterprise software platforms, ServiceNow, who is one of our big partners here in Season 14.Ben: ServiceNow is the AI platform for your enterprise, helping automate processes, improve service delivery, and increase efficiency. Over 85% of the Fortune 500 runs on them, and they have quickly joined the Microsofts and the NVIDIAs as one of the most important enterprise technology vendors in the world.David: Just like those companies, ServiceNow has AI baked in everywhere in their platform, and they're also a major partner of both Microsoft and NVIDIA. I was at NVIDIA's GTC last week, which, by the way, was insane. I felt like a VIP at a Taylor Swift concert, it was crazy. Jensen brought up ServiceNow and their partnership many times throughout the keynote.Why is ServiceNow so important both to NVIDIA and to Microsoft? AI in the real world is only as good as the bedrock platform infrastructure it runs on. For enterprises around the world, ServiceNow manages that infrastructure.All the AI applications for enterprises, whether that's supercharging developers with generative AI, empowering and streamlining customer service, allowing HR to deliver better employee experiences, ServiceNow has already done the hard technical work to make rolling them out not just possible, but easy and fast.Ben: Employees can get answers quickly with smarter self-service like changing 401(k) contributions directly through AI powered chat, or developers can build apps faster with AI powered code generation, and service agents can use AI to notify you that someone's product needs replacing before they even chat with you about it. With the ServiceNow platform, your business is 100% ready for AI. Simply turn it on, and it all works.David: They've built AI directly into their platform, so all the integration work to prepare for it that otherwise would have taken you years is already done. If you want to learn more about the ServiceNow platform and how it can turbocharge the time to deploy AI for your business, go on over to servicenow.com/acquired. When you get in touch, just tell them that Ben and David sent you.The IBM PC. Why is IBM getting into the personal computer here in 1980? A fun quote we heard in our research was that IBM was the sun, the moon, the stars of the computing industry. That meant the hardcore enterprise mainframe computing industry.Ben: David, are you going to attribute that quote or are you going to leave listeners just hanging?David: All right, I think it's time. We talked to probably 10 early Microsoft people in research and preparation. One of those folks was Steve Ballmer himself. He used those words in describing IBM.Ben: And it's hard to imagine a better person to get their perspective on what IBM meant to the world at this point in time, because 1980 was also the year that Steve joined Microsoft. Literally at the same time in 1980, you've got the management team coming together with Steve, Bill, and Paul Allen, and you've got the IBM thing going on, and you've got them moving to Seattle. We haven't even talked about Charles Simonyi yet, but this was the year he joined.David: This is the year. Every year for Microsoft until this point is the year, but 1980 is big.Ben: Okay, so why is IBM the sun, the moon, and the stars of computing? Why are they getting into this PC? It's way cheaper than anything else they sell. It seems to be a totally different business strategy, a different customer set. What's going on?David: All the early microcomputers we were just talking about, the Altair, the Apple II, the TRS-80, are all 8-bit machines. They're running the Intel 8080 processor or a competitor making a similar 8-bit processor. The problem with an 8-bit processor is that the maximum data size for a given instruction cycle in the processor—this is called a data word in computer science terminology—is 256, 28. You can't represent any number greater than 256 in any given CPU clock cycle in an 8-bit machine.Ben: It's effectively a bandwidth limitation, where if you're in a single clock cycle trying to do some particular instruction, it's a very, very small amount of data that you can move through the arithmetic logic unit or that you can move through the processor in that clock cycle.David: Totally. You could think of it as an hourglass or something. There's all the data sitting there in memory at the top of the hourglass, and then there's this small little funnel that it goes through. That's the processor, and then it comes out.Ben: That's a good analogy. It's going to take forever.David: Yeah, into the application of the software that the user sees. You just are not really going to process it that fast.Ben: Very primitive machines.David: Yes. For a company IBM, they eclipsed the 8-bit computing cycle a long, long, long time ago. Mainframes, even minicomputers with DEC, all these machines are at least 16-bit, if not 32-bit computing machines. 8-bit is just not interesting.Ben: Which is why they only cost $375 or whatever for an Altair.David: Right. In late 1979, Intel announces that they're coming out with the 8086 processor, which is a 16-bit microprocessor. With 16 bits, you can really start to do some damage here in terms of the applications that you could put on this thing to eat into business software use cases.Ben: In 16 bits, you can represent numbers up to 65,536, so that's two to the 16th. You can do interesting things passing 16 bits around at once.David: There are some really, really fun aspects to this. If you look at pictures of these processors, what did the 8080, the 8-bit processor look like? And then you look at what the 8086, the 16-bit processor, looked like? You can see this.In the 8008 processor that's only eight bits, you see only nine pins coming off of the little chip. There's the eight pins for the data bits, and then I think there's one more control pin. If you look at the 8086 processor, it's a much longer rectangle with 16, 17, maybe 20 pins coming off of it. You see this physically represented in the chip.Ben: The further we get in the computing world, the more abstract stuff becomes. It's always fun to go back in history when these concepts were so grounded in our physical reality that's easily observable since everything was so much bigger too.David: Yeah. Back in 1980, the 8086 has been announced, 16-bit microprocessor is coming. IBM has already lived through missing a computing expansion era once with DEC and the minicomputer. They just let DEC take that market. Of course, that didn't really hurt IBM, but man, it would have been nice to also have that market too.Ben: The thing that they're observing about the microcomputer market is it's exploding. People in our industry know about DEC, people in the broader world never knew about DEC. But I think it's a very different rate of adoption and rate of demand with microcomputers where IBM started to look at and go, oh, this might be a really big computer market for people.David: They're finally observing the same thing that Bill and Paul did all the way back in the Traf-O-Date days of this is an exponential cycle. Moore's law, this is exponential, and exponential gets real big very quickly once you get a few years in.Ben: Yup.David: The mini computer cycle never was that. It's hard to remember today, but just to underscore this again, in 1980, IBM was the most valuable company in the entire world, the highest market cap company, bigger than all the oil companies in 1980.Ben: The sun, the moon, and the stars.David: Yes. Do you know what their market capital was?Ben: In 1980, $150 billion?David: You are almost an order of magnitude off $34 billion. That was the most valuable company. It is wild what a different world we live in today.Ben: Yeah, even inflation adjusted, it's interesting that the rate of growth of the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap has far outpaced inflation.David: That company, the most valuable in the world, they're going to tiny little Microsoft that's just moved to Seattle for this partnership. What's going on here? This is just so amazing. They deserve so much credit here. They got the Clay Christensen disrupt yourself, disruptive technology thing intuitively decades before Clay writes any of this stuff.The way that they decide to compete is all the things that Clay wrote about are working against us here. What we need to do is we need to create essentially a skunk works division, just our Lockheed episode. We need to do something outside the company, completely removed from the politics, sure, but the business incentives not to disrupt ourselves, and create a new division they called the entry level systems division. Actually, it may have existed before, but they repurpose it.Ben: This is in Boca Raton?David: In Boca Raton, Florida. Very nice place. We were just there a couple of months ago, but not a technology hotbed in the world. They create a secret project called Project Chess, secret from the rest of the company, the whole world. The goal is to develop the IBM microcomputer or the personal computer, as people are starting to refer to microcomputers.This is wild. They're going to do it in secret with a small team with no other IBM resources. That means this small team, the only way they can do it is to use all off-the-shelf components from technology providers, basically play on the same level playing field as all the other microcomputer manufacturers out there.One more thing, IBM leadership tells this team in Boca, they have to ship the PC to customers within one year.Ben: It's a crazy constraint.David: It is a total crazy constraint. A couple of quotes on this. Don Estridge, who is one of the leaders of Project Chess, would later say that the company realized that if you're going to compete against people who started in a garage, obviously a reference to Apple here, you have to start in a garage yourself. Lou Gerstner, who later would take over IBM, would describe this whole Boca project as, \"The way you get an elephant to tap dance.\"Ben: The question is, are they playing from behind and thus have to adopt a flawed strategy, or is this strategy of assembling with all off-the-shelf components actually a good strategy if it works?David: Let's tell the story and then come back to it.Ben: Great.David: Okay. What do they do? The hardware aspect of this is trivial, basically. Ed Roberts could put together the hardware to sell a microcomputer and do this deal with Intel. I think IBM can do a deal with Intel, not necessarily trickier but the more important part is the software. Thanks to Bill's genius strategy about be the volume player, don't optimize on per unit price, set the standards out there.Ben: They were the world's leading provider of programming language interpreters, right?David: 100%. There is one game in town and one game in town only, and that is Microsoft in Bellevue, Washington at this point in time.Ben: Now, interpreters are notably different from operating systems, but Microsoft definitely has raised the flag. Everyone could see, if I want to go buy software for my computers, broadly, they're an interesting group to talk to.David: Yeah. Obviously, operating systems are going to become really, really big here in just a sec. Again, the 8-bit generation operating systems weren't that important because people were writing their own software. The standardized software, packaged application software doesn't happen until the 16-bit era and doesn't really, really happen until the 16-bit era and the IBM PC. That's why BASIC the interpreter is so important.What happens? IBM calls up Bill Gates. By August, 1980, the two companies are in serious talks to partner and work together on the IBM PC. We referenced Steve Ballmer a minute ago. The timing is just crazy. Steve had just joined the company in June of 1980.Ben: He's employee number 30.David: The Microsoft team of 30, which the whole company of Microsoft pivots to work on the IBM PC partnership, is bigger than the Project Chess team in Boca.Ben: It's amazing.David: Wow. Okay, Bill has just convinced Steve to drop out of business school at Stanford and come help him and Paul run the company. Microsoft at this point in time is still a partnership. Steve is the first person besides Bill and Paul to get equity in the company when he joins. It's 8.5% and it's a handshake deal at this point.Ben: Bill really, really wanted to bring Steve on. He knew him from the Harvard days, knew what an asset he could be.David: He is the Yin of Bill's Yang.Ben: Yes. Frankly, 8.5%, it's a big grant. Who's out there running a 30-person company, and you're giving away 8.5% slugs? That just doesn't happen. Those are founder shares. This is really a reflection that the way that Bill thought about Steve was as a founder.In fact, it created some tension with Paul Allen, where Bill asked Paul, if they could go to 5%, Paul said, sure. And then Bill actually offered him 8.5%. Paul got upset and Bill said, I'll eat the 3.5%. It can come out of my share because I want him that bad.David: He's the perfect person for this point in time. Bill was the only salesperson doing these OEM deals. Now they're dealing with IBM. They're entering the enterprise world. This needs to be a real business.Back to the IBM negotiations, obviously Microsoft is very interested. IBM is not just very interested in working with Microsoft. They have to work with Microsoft. They're the only game in town.Ben: Specifically, they asked Microsoft for programming languages. They're like, we're making this great PC, we're going to need a BASIC. We think you guys are working on a COBOL. We'd like some COBOL.David: Yeah, Fortran. Give us the whole thing. There's some debate on whether it was the Microsoft side or the IBM side that really saw the vision of, hey, the 16-bit generation is going to enable real business software use cases on the personal computer, but it doesn't matter. That's the plan here, and that is absolutely what happens.These initial discussions are for the programming language. Microsoft doesn't make an operating system at this point, because in the 8-bit generation, the operating system, I think, was a glorified bootloader to just get into the programming environment so that you could either write or load up the BASIC programs that Microsoft was going to interpret and then run.In the 8-bit generation, most, if not all hardware providers of microcomputers just wrote their own operating systems. It just wasn't a big deal. Now, there was one off-the-shelf operating system out there from a company called Digital Research, which was run by Gary Kildall, who, I think as we talked about earlier, Bill and Paul had actually intersected with back in Seattle.Ben: Yup. I think they were reasonably friendly.David: Yeah, I think they were quite friendly because they partnered. You needed the operating system to get into the programming environment. It wasn't that big of a deal. Whenever anybody needed one off-the-shelf, Bill and Microsoft would just refer people over to Digital to get it.Ben: Yup. CP/M, right?David: Exactly. CP/M, which I think is maybe Control Program for Microprocessors, I think, is the abbreviation there.Ben: God, they were so bad. Every single thing that's been named to this point, except for the company Microsoft, was a horrible name. The processor is 8008, and now it's 8080, but the machine is 8800, that the processor is inside. Give me a break, everyone. It's horrible naming.David: Bill and I'm sure Paul too, but Bill is the only person in this industry that has the vision for what this can become, even Intel. Bill talks about this. He doesn't think that Intel even realizes what's happening here. They're just like, oh, we're just making more chips, and people use them for stuff.Ben: It does seem like very few people are thinking about their products as something they really need to build a brand around with consumers, hence the naming schemes.David: The IBM, Microsoft discussions are going along. IBM's like, oh, hey, yeah, we need an operating system. Bill, I think from everything we've read and folks we've talked to, in good faith just does the standard thing he's always done in these situations. He's like, oh yeah, go talk to Gary, go talk to Digital Research. He can probably do that.Ben: Right. We don't have an operating system, this guy does.David: What happens next is unclear. But what is clear is however it goes down, this is one of, if not the biggest business blunder in history. IBM, that team from Project Chess, flies down, I think, directly from Seattle and talking with Bill and Steve to Monterey, California, where Digital Research is based at this point, to meet with Gary and his wife, Dorothy, who run the business together. Bill's called them. He's like, hey, I got a big OEM client coming down, needs an operating system.Ben: He signed hefty, hefty NDAs. He cannot say who it is, but he's like, you really should take this seriously.David: Right. The team comes down. Obviously, they show up there from IBM. There's a big snafu where Gary does not attend the meeting. There are conflicting reports about what happened.Ben: Was it one of them that he's out flying an airplane?David: Yeah. I'm pretty sure he was flying his personal airplane while this happens. Some reports are he was just out joyriding and missed it. Some reports are no, he was on a business trip, knew it was happening, but he had another important business meeting. He didn't know that this was IBM that was coming. Regardless, it doesn't really matter because IBM just wants the operating system.Dorothy does meet with them. She's unwilling to sign their NDA. There's a lawyer from Digital Research who gets involved, and he doesn't really understand what's going on.The punchline is that IBM leaves this interaction with the belief that Gary and Digital Research aren't up for working with them and aren't capable of producing here. Producing is important because it's not like the existing CP/M OS that they made would work here. They would have to write a new version, a 16-bit version, and they hadn't done that yet.Ben: In particular, they would have to do some customizing. But part of what IBM wants is a customized version of an operating system for the IBM PC. They don't want this to be fully off-the-shelf.Just to add one more stir the pot of history here, there is another version of this story where Gary does actually have a conversation with IBM, and it blows up over licensing terms. What Gary really wants is a significant royalty of every IBM PC sold, and IBM walks over that. Whether that happened or whether it's just an NDA issue, either way, I think we all know the IBM PC did not end up running the CP/M operating system.David: That's amazing. I didn't know that. We'll talk about that when we get to the business terms of the Microsoft IBM deal in a minute. But for the moment, there's no deal yet because an operating system needs to be provided here.IBM goes back to Microsoft and they're like, hey, this guy you referred us to ain't going to work. The way that I read some quotes from the IBM people here were like, we just threw the problem back in Microsoft's lap of you guys deal with this, you source an operating system.I'd like to say that Bill, Steve, and Microsoft, you don't need to give them an opportunity twice. In this case, you did need to give them an opportunity twice because they almost flubbed it and sent IBM down to see Gary. This time they don't flub it. They're like, okay, we'll get you an operating system.Ben: Enter Seattle Computer Products.David: Yes. It just so happens that right down the road from Microsoft in the Seattle area—I think despite being named Seattle Computer Products, I think this company was actually based in Tukwila, Washington—a programmer named Tim Patterson had just written a 16-bit operating system for the 8086 that Intel had just announced, and he was calling it the Quick and Dirty 16-bit Operating System or QDOS for short, and had it ready to go.Why had he written this? What was this company, Seattle Computer Products? Why did they have an operating system? They were a component provider to microcomputer manufacturers. They essentially made motherboards. When Intel now has announced this new 16-bit processor generation that they're coming out with, Seattle Computer Products want to sell motherboards and have them ready for 16-bit.They need to test and play around with these things, and their customers are asking for it. They had been going to Kildall and Digital Research too and badgering them to like, hey, write the 16-bit version of CP/M. Gary just didn't, so Tim's like, fine, I'll do a quick and dirty version myself, and thus DOS is born.Ben: Incredible, which of course later, they would drop the Q and call it DOS, the Disk Operating System. Something about dirty didn't have a ring to it when you're selling it to IBM.David: No. Bill, Paul, and Microsoft have learned about this. They know Seattle Computer Products, they know Rod Brock, the guy who owns the company. They get in touch with him and they say, hey, can we license QDOS from you and Tim? We've got a big OEM customer that wants a 16-bit operating system. They work out a deal whereby Microsoft pays Seattle Computer Products $25,000 for the rights to adapt and sell QDOS to the one unnamed original equipment manufacturer who they're working with.Tim, actually, is jazzed about this. He ends up leaving SCP computer products and joining Microsoft. With the rest of the team, he's part of building DOS, taking his initial work and turning it into real DOS. Later on, before this all gets announced and the PC ships, Microsoft would pay Seattle computer products another $50,000 for full rights to own 86 QDOS, sell and license it to anybody else indefinitely. I believe the total amount of dollars that changed hands here is $75,000.Ben: Unbelievable.David: This is DOS. One programmer wrote a \"quick and dirty\" operating system, and Microsoft bought the license to that and adapted it into DOS. Tim, when he was at Seattle computer products, definitely did not write DOS as DOS. It's not like Microsoft bought all of DOS for $75,000. They did a lot of work on it, but this is how it all goes down.Ben: Microsoft would eventually generate billions of dollars on DOS-based products. You're exactly right in the same way that Instagram today is a much different code base than Instagram and much larger code base than Instagram when it was purchased, but my God, $75,000 to buy DOS to get this whole thing started. Until Windows 95, all of the Windows operating systems were DOS-based.David: It's just crazy. It really illustrates how fast things were moving, how much all this was getting invented and discovered in real time that even to this point, Bill Gates isn't thinking that operating systems are that important. This is just a shortcut to get the deal done with IBM to make it happen.Ben: Also, David, I got to say, I just looked it up. The address of Seattle Computer Products, on the original business card for Seattle Computer Products where I presume QDOS was written, the space is available, so I know where our next studio needs to be.David: It's in Tequila?Ben: It's in Tequila.David: All right. The rent can't be that expensive then, so let's do it.Ben: Correct.David: Hell, yeah. We've been joking for years about making the Acquired Museum. We might have a location.Okay. Now they've got the operating system, they've got QDOS or DOS in place to license the IBM. The only thing that is left to formalize the partnership is the business terms.Ben, if what you said is right about the Gary Kildall IBM negotiations, this is just a master stroke from Bill here in the licensing with IBM, because there are two really, really big levers that it looks like Bill is giving big time on one of them, but he is winning big time on the other one.Ben: What are they?David: The one that it looks like he's giving on is he does another fixed cost OEM deal with IBM.Ben: This is in Paul Allen's memoir. IBM paid Microsoft $75,000 for testing and consultation, $45,000 for DOS, and $310,000 for an array of 16-bit language interpreters and compilers. All told, bundled together, that is $430,000 fixed that IBM paid Microsoft with no ongoing obligation.David: Yes. No per copy royalties. Every copy of DOS that IBM sells is either included as part of systems that they're selling, or they're free to charge independently for DOS, whatever amount they want, Microsoft gets $0. If it's true that this is where things fell apart with Gary Kildall, crazy that Bill is willing to do this.Ben: You might say, what? Didn't Bill learn his lesson? Why would he ever agree to this?David: On the one hand, this is what he was doing with Apple and others. He was doing these fixed cost deals. He would think, man, IBM, this is the time. People aren't going to pirate IBM software. Now's the time to really grab the money bags.Ben: But Bill saw something that no one else did.David: I don't know if it was directly in exchange in the negotiations, but the other lever that he saw, that he pulled was Microsoft retained the rights to own DOS and to own their languages and license it and them to anyone else they wanted at any price on any terms.Ben: It's so interesting, because what ended up happening that Bill Gates masterminded was once we distribute our operating system through IBM's PC, that's going to become the thing everyone buys. Now, in the 16-bit generation, when there are people building programs for computers, not just developers, once those application developers who are writing programs are targeting an operating system, then that is the operating system that every other OEM, every other computer maker is also going to want and really need, and we're going to be the ones that they have to come to to buy it.I can't figure out, did IBM miss this fact? Or did they know it? Basically, what IBM did was they were the one place where every business needed to go for their computer needs. What they did in this negotiation was they actually handed that over to Microsoft. They said, we are going to become a commodity, just like every other hardware manufacturer, and you are going to be the point of integration for the whole ecosystem. You're going to be the linchpin that everyone has to target for their applications.David: I think there are two things going on here, one small and one big. The small thing is actually related all the way back to the beginning of the episode, what you said, Ben, about the antitrust concerns within IBM. To hear them say it, they actually didn't want ownership of the software. They wanted it to be separate because it would look better.Ben: Because then they have the plausible deniability of, how could we possibly have a monopoly? We're buying off-the-shelf...David: Part of an ecosystem, blah-blah-blah. Yeah.Ben: Yeah. From a vendor who can sell to anybody else. We have no lock in.David: That may well be true. I think the bigger thing that just wasn't in their consideration or mindset was they (I think) assumed that once they entered the PC market, IBM was going to be the dominant player, so it didn't matter. Once IBM is selling PCs, who's going to buy a PC from anybody else? IBM is going to win this market.Ben: Just like they have in every other line of business they've been in.David: What Bill saw was he really made a bet that the same dynamics that played out with the Altair were also going to play out with the IBM PC. There would be a million hardware manufacturers, flowers blooming here.Ben: Building to the same spec.David: Building to the same spec.Ben: Using the same processor.David: Which of course, they could because it was all off-the-shelf components. IBM either didn't see or didn't believe that that would actually happen.Ben: IBM failed to see the value of software, and they certainly failed to understand what a software platform business model would be.David: Which makes sense. Why would they? They are the computing company.Ben: Yes. Their experience in selling mainframes with everything bundled in was the wrong experience to go off of in understanding the way the future would unfold. Bill's very modest experience watching the Altair and all these Altair clone type machines, or even if they're not Altair clones, just more microcomputers that need more software, actually was the useful experience to pattern match off of of what does the world of microcomputers look like, and how is that fundamentally different than the world of mainframes.David: Totally. In a way that the mini computer generation, like we've been saying, it was like a half generation. It wasn't actually fundamentally that different other than DEC gained a foothold.Ben: The deal that Bill Gates made with IBM for the IBM PC is the greatest deal in at least computer industry history, if not all business history, full stop.David: Let's say a little bit about why. It's obvious, but here now is IBM, most valuable company in the world. They're going to come out with the PC platform. They are going to build the market. Microsoft is going to own the linchpin, in Hamilton Helmer terms, where the power is in the market, and they're going to be free to license it at whatever terms they want to any other player who wants to enter.They signed this agreement in November 1980. The IBM PC ships in August 1981. Just incredible, almost exactly a little more than a year from the time Project Chess starts to when they actually ship the PC.Ben: Truly incredible, they pulled it off.David: Truly incredible. It changes the world. That's such a trite thing to say, but everything that everybody's imagining happens.Ben: IBM was right that it was by far in a way the most successful personal computer on the market as soon as they released it.David: Totally. They sell 13,500 IBM PCs within the first couple of months after they announce it. Over the next two years, they sell half a million of them, makes them unquestionably the largest personal microcomputer manufacturer/market leader. Everybody at IBM is celebrating. The clones haven't arrived yet, and maybe they won't. It'll play out like they think. Not exactly.Before we talk about the clones, this is really just a footnote because of course all the incentives are aligned for IBM to push DOS as the operating system for the PC. They've done this whole deal with Microsoft. They have a royalty-free deal with them.When they launch the PC, customers actually have a choice of which operating system they want on their IBM PC. They don't have to go with DOS. Consumers can choose between DOS, 16-bit CP/M. By this point in time, Gary and Digital Research have gotten their act together. They've written a 16-bit version of the CPM operating system. Or another 16-bit operating system called Pascal that came out of the University of California at San Diego.The price sheet for the operating system option is Pascal is an extra $450 with your IBM PC. CP/M is an extra $175 with your IBM PC, and DOS, which was developed specifically for the PC is the best way to run it is only $60. IBM is making $60 of full 100% margin on top of their hardware for the PC by selling DOS because they don't have to pay Microsoft any of that, and they've set up the incentives that obviously everybody's going to choose DOS.Ben: It's fascinating. And you know what? To give them a little bit more credit too, they did try to enforce that there's some amount of lock-in to the IBM PC. They did that in two ways. One is we're simplifying calling it DOS. It was PC-DOS, which is different than MS-DOS, which would get licensed to other computer makers. I don't know exactly what happened, but it basically seems like it just wasn't different enough to be meaningful to application developers. That's one piece of it.The second is IBM did actually have proprietary BIOS. That was another part where they thought that that might provide them some protection, where they could stay a linchpin in the ecosystem. It wasn't just all off-the-shelf. They actually did have something that was theirs that was proprietary.David: It just turned out that the effort required to reverse engineer the IBM BIOS was trivial, basically.Ben: Do you know the story of the Compaq BIOS?David: I know the Compaq story, but I don't know the story of the BIOS specifically. Enlighten us.Ben:  It is basically why Compaq worked is what it comes down to. Compaq was formed basically to clone the IBM PC. They saw the market opportunity, and they realized they could buy from all the same equipment vendors. Let's go eat their margin is basically the plan.However, the one thing that was not off-the-shelf is the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), which is effectively the thing that decides to load the operating system when you turn the machine on. There's some proprietary magic that happens to call upon the operating system to do its thing. Compaq reverse engineered the BIOS. The way that they did it was very similar to Trip Hawkins and the story that he told us about his reverse engineering at Electronic Arts.David: Of the Psychogenesis.Ben: Yes. Compaq had two engineers. One engineer went in and fully dissected the code for the IBM PC BIOS, basically saw all the proprietary calls that it made, and documented each of those calls without writing the implementation steps. Then he handed, hey, here's what the BIOS needs to interface with, over to the other engineer. The other engineer, on their own, just went through and thought of an implementation.They have no idea if it's the same implementation, so it's not breaking any infringement. They're basically saying, I'm just seeing the requirements for this product, and I'm coming up with my own implementation of that product. They basically figured out how to exactly clone the IBM PC and buy the very same operating system.To go back to quoting Ben Thompson because this is from his great piece again, \"The result was a company that came to dominate the market. Compaq was the fastest startup to ever hit $100 million in revenue, then the youngest firm to break into the Fortune 500, then the fastest company to hit $1 billion in revenue, and by 1994, Compaq was the largest PC maker in the world.\"David: The Compaq story is amazing. The three people who start Compaq in 1982 are actually Texas Instruments engineers who left, and they wanted to start a company. I believe as the legend goes, they were trying to decide what to start. They were considering a restaurant chain and a bunch of different business ideas. The IBM PC comes out at the end of 1981 and they're like, oh, we can clone this and do everything, the story you just told. It's wild. They start the company in 1982. Within the first year, they do $111 million of revenue of selling IBM PC clone hardware.Ben: And is it just cheaper? Basically this is the IBM PC, but for less money?David: Yes, exactly. Same thing, cheaper.Ben: So begins the race to the bottom of PC hardware. Completely undifferentiated, all the value accrues to the software layer.David: Totally. Compaq went public the very next year, in 1983 well before Microsoft, which is funny. Compaq, all these other clone companies that get started. Microsoft licenses DOS to all of them importantly, critically, on a per-machine-sold basis. This is when they grab the money. The operating system is so deeply embedded and needs to get shipped with the computer itself.Consumers can go buy operating systems to upgrade and whatnot, but no hardware manufacturer is going to ship a 16-bit PC without an operating system. Piracy is not an issue here. Microsoft can now do a per-copy-sold, per-machine-sold license with all these clones. My God, it's just a geyser of money.Ben: Microsoft used IBM to generate demand for their software, and then they used every other PC manufacturer to capture the value that all that demand created.David: Yeah. I think I have these numbers and timeframes right. I believe that for calendar year 1982, Microsoft's revenue was $25 million. I think this must have been when they switched to fiscal year end and June 30th. Microsoft's fiscal year end starting then and up through now is June 30th.They're fiscal 1984. The year ended June 30th, 1984, so 1983 midpoint to 1984 midpoint. Microsoft does $98 million. In an 18-month period from the end of 1982, they go from $25–$98 million. It's all on the back of the clones. Unlike Compaq that they did $111 million of revenue their first year, they're selling hardware which has serious cogs associated with it. Microsoft, 100% essentially, gross margin, software revenue, more than doubling year on year. It's the best business of all time.Ben: Yes, and they combined two magical principles together. This infinite replicability, zero marginal costs of software, and becoming the linchpin of the ecosystem. They are now the software that everyone needs to target, which gives them pricing power. That pricing power raises your top line, and you have no costs. It's unbelievable.David: Meanwhile, in the computing industry background, while all this is going on with the launch of the IBM PC and then the clones, Apple had gone public at the end of 1980 in I think, the biggest and most successful IPO of all time at that point. Remember we talked about Genentech on the Novo Nordisk episode. They went public right before Apple, and then Apple was bigger. They're valued at $1.8 billion at IPO. Steve Jobs is this multi hundred millionaire, media darling, all this stuff.The next year in 1981, Microsoft reorganizes from the partnership between Bill and Paul with the handshake deal that Steve's going to be cut in on the partnership into a stock company, a C-corporation. As part of doing that, the venture firm, Technology Venture Investors (TVI) invest $1 million, I believe, for 5% of the company. This is crazy. That's a $20 million post money valuation.Ben: It's a 1-on-20 post when Microsoft is doing how much in revenue?David: That year, they did $17 million in revenue, and they're about to do the IBM deal. This is absolutely absurd.Ben: It says a lot about this period of time that you could do a 1X revenue deal in a high-margin software company. I actually don't think this shows a weakness in Microsoft. Oh, they didn't have leverage or something that. That wasn't it at all, it was just the deals sucked.David: Venture capital sucked back then. There's no other way to put it.Ben: It's only 5%, so good on Microsoft. Spoiler alert, this is the only dilution that they would ever take. That's also extremely different than today, but a $20 million valuation at this stage is frankly ludicrous.David: Even among people who should be in the know, the beauty of the software business model still is something people don't understand.Ben: That's exactly right.David: The hotness is the hardware. It's like Apple just IPO'd. Apple's worth $1.8 billion. Like, ooh, that's the industry, ooh, it's IBM, et cetera. When Microsoft itself would go public a few years later in 1986, they actually go public the same week that they moved to the big campus in Redmond, where they are to this day. Their market cap at IPO is only $750 million despite having done $200 million of very high margin software revenue in the trailing 12 months up to that, growing 100% year over year. It's insane.Ben: Hey, that's 4X multiple expansion off the last time they raised money.David: Right? It's just crazy that people don't yet appreciate the power.Ben: Bill Gates and Warren Buffett did a conversation at the University of Washington in 1998. This is as late as 1998. This thing that we're talking about, the magic of the software business model and how it should be reflected in a company's valuation especially when it's a high-growth company was still not understood even by Bill Gates himself.Here's the quote. Bill Gates says, \"I think the multiples of technology stocks should be quite a bit lower than the multiples of stocks like Coke and Gillette because we are subject to complete changes in the rules. I know very well that in the next 10 years, if Microsoft is still a leader, we will have had to weather at least three crises.\" Bill Gates is essentially making an argument. Granted, this is in the middle of all the antitrust stuff, so he's very prime for this.David: And the Internet.Ben: And the Internet. He's basically making the argument that disruptive forces come at you so fast in the technology industry that even though you can grow extremely fast, it's this extremely scalable thing, distributing software at zero distribution costs, and even though the margins are unbelievable because you have zero marginal costs, they still shouldn't be valued as highly as a CPG company, which is so different than the way that people think about it today.David: It's funny. I've thought about this a lot, and I actually watched that interview years ago. It's so good. There are elements of truth to this too. I think it's that for most technology companies, that is totally true. For a few technology companies that have true power and true scale, the exact opposite is true. Microsoft is still the most valuable company in the world today.Ben: Companies that are less susceptible to disruption, more predictable in terms of high growth, high margin revenue deserve a premium. But Gates is basically arguing, everyone else doesn't.Let's flash all the way back to 1981 and talk about this venture capital investment, this 1-on-20 that TVI does.David: Good work if you can get a man.Ben: How does this come to be? Even a whole year before in the fall of 1980, Dave Marquardt, one of the partners and the founders at TVI, flies up to Seattle not to meet Bill Gates, but to meet Steve Ballmer.David: Because they were classmates at GSB, right?Ben: They weren't quite classmates, but because I think they were two years apart, so they didn't overlap, but they had some of the same social circles. Steve was effectively the screener for anyone who wanted to come and talk to Bill and try and invest in the business.TA Associates had been up, Sutter Hill had been up, Hambrick and Quist had been up, Xerox Ventures, and all of them only ever got to meet with Steve Ballmer and never got passed on to Bill Gates. Steve would basically just bounce them off. I know all this because there's a great oral history from the Computer History Museum, where this whole thing's in a transcript with an interview with Dave Marquardt recalling the whole thing.Dave flies up to meet with Steve. Steve says, you're asking really interesting questions. You're thinking about our strategy the right way. You don't just want to do a transactional deal. You really think this is something special. Why don't you meet with Bill? Bill, of course, doesn't have any extra time in his schedule. He says, but I am going to the U-Dub Arizona football game at Husky stadium. Why don't you come and talk to me there?Of course they go, Bill doesn't pay attention to the game at all. He's just laying out the strategy, grilling Dave, and talking about software the whole time. This is fall of 1980. That's a whole year before the deal gets done. Dave's remarking at this point in 1980, they're doing $5 million in revenue, $2–$3 million in profit. They don't need VC money, and yet he was able to get in.Here's the quote. \"I was just helping them out with the business. In the venture business, you're buying and you're selling at the same time. You're trying to figure out, are these guys crazy? Are they ever going to do anything really interesting? If so, how do I get myself positioned to be able to help them do it? So I spent a lot of time up there helping recruit people. I helped to recruit Charles Simonyi, who was an early key guy.\" Charles Simonyi would go on, this is an aside, to write Microsoft Word. Charles was at Xerox PARC inventing the GUI.David: We're going to talk about Charles in just a sec.Ben: Yes. He says, “And I was working with Steve on business strategy. They had these OEM customers, the PC manufacturers, and they had started to engage with IBM on this operating system. Are we just going to become a low-cost contract programming shop for IBM, an outsourced sweatshop? Or is there some way we can build a business out of this?Which led to the fixed fee to IBM, the retention of the code, which then we could sell to other people. That's what created the PC industry basically.” That is his recollection of the whole thing, that he was very helpful in this transformative time for the company. At the same time, you have to look at everyone else's incentives.David: How can I be helpful, Ben?Ben: Dave is only 29 years old, but everyone else is 23. He actually is adult supervision. At the same time, the partnership was still just a partnership, and there was a handshake deal for the equity. If you're Steve Ballmer at this point in history, it would be nice to have a forcing function to actually turn this into a corporation so that we can get some shares granted here. There's a little bit of incentive to say, hey, if we take on an outside investor, we're going to have to restructure.David: That's what I had always read about the TVI investment. Obviously, Microsoft didn't need the money. They like Dave, but also a big part of it was this was a catalyzing function to do the conversion into a C-corp.Ben: Yes. This would create a little bit of board and governance, so it's not just Bill all the time. Bill, of course, I think is still the controlling shareholder just by the amount of stock that he owns. But there's a board. It's Bill, it's Dave, and it's Kay Nishi. It's a three-person board.David: Yeah, we should say-to-vis a vis Paul, tragically, and I believe it was 1982-1983, he's diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. He ends up taking a leave and then fully leaving the company. I think he did go on and off the board at various points in time.Ben: That's true.David: But he's no longer a full-time member of the company after his diagnosis.Ben: Yup. On this venture investment, it's pretty fascinating. None of these are terribly compelling reasons other than, I guess, it would be nice to have a little bit of capital associated with us formalizing the corporation, but they don't need money at all. They're printing cash. They've been printing cash ever since that one tight period in Albuquerque. Dave charmed them. I think that's the answer.David: I've always heard wonderful, wonderful things about Dave, and I think everybody really did love him and see his value. But man, to be a venture capitalist in the 1980s and 1990s, oh, man, you couldn't lose.Ben: It's pretty crazy. I think part of it too had to do with the fact that Microsoft was up in Seattle. The VCs just weren't traveling. Dave was young and he was single.David: Don Valentine famously had the rule. They didn't invest in any company that you couldn't bicycle to from Sand Hill Road.Ben: It's crazy. Dave Marquardt, I think most weekends, is flying up to Seattle to hang out with Bill and Steve. It was a real sell. He says, I was young, I was single, I had nothing better to do, and it was really fun and intellectually interesting, so I did it. That resulted in, depending how long TVI held, one of, if not the best venture capital return in history.David: Hard to argue with that one. Okay, back to the story. There are a couple more really, really key things that happened in the PC era. Particularly now, once we're into the IBM PC era and the clones, the 16-bit era. Let's start with applications.Like we've been saying all along, the 8-bit era, applications, package software aren't really a thing. In 1979, at the tail end of the 8-bit era, two programs come out for the Apple II, VisiCalc and WordStar. VisiCalc is the first software spreadsheet application, and WordStar is a word processor. These applications by today's standards are super simple, stone age–type stuff, but they're the first of their kind, particularly VisiCalc and the spreadsheet. They established the potential for business applications on personal computers.There's a joke at one point in the industry that the Apple II was a \"VisiCalc\" accessory for small businesses. I think that is part of what IBM is seeing and why they're deciding to now get into the industry with the personal computer. Around this time, Microsoft starts the \"Consumer Products Division\" to compete and make application software themselves.Ben: It's quite telling it's called the Consumer Products Division to make applications. Even though they're competing to make these applications that today we would view as business tools, spreadsheets, and word processing, that is not how they referred to it.David: Right. One of the first people that they hire into this new division to get it going is an engineer, Ben, who you referenced just a minute ago, named Charles Simonyi. They poach Charles, perhaps with Dave Marquardt's help, away from the legendary Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC). I think this is one of the great misconceptions in technology history. Hopefully we can set the record straight a little bit here.Ben: Yes. If you ask anybody in our ecosystem, save for the 1% of people who actually know this, what happened at Xerox PARC? They will tell you they invented the mouse, they invented the graphical user interface, and then Steve Jobs walked in, he saw it all, and he said, oh, my God, we have to have it. He went off and he made the Lisa, which had a graphical user interface and a mouse. That failed, but what succeeded was the Macintosh, and it's a wholesale ripoff of Xerox PARC that lives on today in Apple. That is the story that you will hear from basically everyone.David: I've heard it characterized as something like Xerox hosted a picnic in Silicon Valley, and Steve Jobs attended and dined lavishly at the feast.Ben: All of this is true.David: Which is true. That is true. All of that is true.Ben: But it's half the story.David: He was not the only person who dined lavishly at the feast. Microsoft did just as much directly from Xerox, and Charles was one of the main vectors by which this happened.Here is the list of things that were invented or basically invented at Xerox PARC. The graphical user interface, the desktop, the mouse, object-oriented programming, ethernet, laser printing, along with a whole host of other things. This is everything about modern computing, invented there.Who are the people who were at Xerox PARC? There was Alan Kay, there was Bob Metcalfe, who would go on to found 3Com. He invented ethernet, Metcalfe's Law.Ben: Yeah, the value of a network scaling proportionally to the square of the number of inputs.David: Yeah. Bob Metcalf, Xerox PARC, Larry Tesler, who would join Apple, John Warnock, who started Adobe, Eric Schmidt worked at Xerox PARC. Everybody was there. It was a lavish picnic.Ben: And Charles Simonyi.David: And Charles Simonyi. The thing about PARC and the computer that they built there to instantiate all these concepts, which was named the Alto, is it really was a research center. The Alto, go look it up on Wikipedia, go look at pictures. It's the Mac. The Alto is the Mac.Ben: It's the Mac with the monitor turned on its side.David: Yes, it's a vertical Mac.Ben: It's a 3x4 display, not a 4x3 display.David: They start making it in 1973. You might be like, wait a minute, what's going on here? The Mac doesn't come out till 1984.Ben: 11 years earlier.David: How on earth is Xerox making the Mac in the pre 8-bit era, the pre-microprocessor era? It's not a microprocessor. The Alto is not a microprocessor architecture. It's a mini computer. What you see when you look at photos of the Alto is you see the Mac. What you don't see is under the table or behind it is a mini computer.Ben: I never realized that.David: It is not a personal computer architecture at all. It is a 16-bit, essentially mini computer, that costs tens of thousands of dollars to make each one of them. It's a science project.Ben: You should have a little bit more generosity for the East Coast management at Xerox for failing to commercialize this.David: Totally. The time was not right. It was not possible. It wasn't even conceived of in the microprocessor architecture, because the microprocessor basically didn't exist when they made it.Ben: Interesting.David: In 1980, again, this year for Microsoft, same year Microsoft joins, same year they signed the IBM partnership, Charles Simonyi comes up from Xerox PARC. He's of course bringing all this same knowledge, all this same experience that Steve jobs is bringing into Apple. He's bringing all that right into Microsoft too.The first thing that he gets tasked with is working with this new consumer products division to build application software to compete with VisiCalc and WordStar to compete with spreadsheets and to compete in word processing. He leads the teams that create Word and MultiPlan, Microsoft's first spreadsheet. Remember, we're still at the end of the 8-bit era. The graphical user interface doesn't exist yet other than on the Alto in Xerox PARC.Ben: No, these are DOS applications. It's all character mode.David: Yes, it is command line interface. The vector that they think they're going to compete, at least in spreadsheets with VisiCalc, is that they're going to be on every platform out there. VisiCalc, I believe, was more or less basically only on the Apple II. That doesn't end up working too well.The next generation, the IBM PC era, they make the same mistake. The application business stays focused on being on lots of machines, making software that's compatible with everything. A new company pops up called Lotus. Lotus makes the radical decision that they are going to make a spreadsheet only for the IBM PC.This was genius. This is the 1-2-3 spreadsheet. It goes on to become, at that point in time, the most successful software ever. This is wild. I can't even believe I'm about to say this, and it blew my mind when I found it in research. There are a couple of years in the late eighties, where Lotus has more revenue than Microsoft and is valued higher.Ben: Yup. In fact, the year that Microsoft went public, Lotus had more revenue than Microsoft at the IPO.David: Yes. Wild.Ben: it's crazy. Lotus 1-2-3 had some graphics, but it was still in character mode. It was a powerful spreadsheet that could start to do some graphics, even though there wasn't actually a GUI operating system yet, which is interesting. Lotus 1-2-3 was faster, it had bigger spreadsheets, and it was just more powerful. Microsoft Multiplan was still targeting the older 8-bit.Multiplan, despite Microsoft's best efforts, is completely left in the dust. Microsoft's trying to figure out, what should we learn from this? In talking with Pete Higgins and Mike Slade, who were both early leaders in the development and the marketing of the applications division, actually, Mike Slade went on to work directly for Steve Jobs at NeXT and Apple for many years.In chatting with both of them, what basically became apparent Microsoft learned, with our applications, we should not be targeting the current platforms at all. The lesson to learn is never leave yourself open to the next generation of technology. They're learning the Moore's Law lesson again.David: Yes, and how it applies to applications. Yes. You always got to target the next platform.Ben: Right, even if that platform is not the one you own. That's the interesting thing about when they're evaluating Multiplan and they say, how do we not get Lotus 1-2-3 again, basically, the applications team gets the freedom to look around and say, okay, no matter what our overall company strategy is right now, or no matter what the systems division is doing, what is the most cutting-edge platform that is going to be so interesting to people that we can develop the most envelope-pushing technology for it? That becomes the mandate for applications.David: This is the dawn of horizontal software. You can have a whole company or a whole division of a company, in Microsoft's case, that makes this tool. That tool will be so much better than anything that even the largest companies can have their own software developers write. General Electric isn't going to write a better spreadsheet than 1-2-3. I think that the technology complement to this law is the killer app.Ben: You have to counter position. If 1-2-3 is the best spreadsheet out there for the current technology generation, you just can't compete with them. You need to wait for the next big leap forward in order to find a new competitive vector.David: You need to be the killer app on the next platform, and that's what Lotus 1-2-3 did with the spreadsheet on the IBM PC and IBM compatible PC. That's what Microsoft decides, hey, we got to do this in the graphical interface.Ben: Who's about to come out with the very best instantiation of a graphical user interface? Apple computer.David: That would be Steve Jobs.Ben: Yes. The next chapter of our Microsoft story is the Macintosh in 1984.David: It's so fun.Ben: Before we do that, this is the perfect time to talk about another one of our favorite companies and longtime Acquired partners who are back, pilot.com. For startups and growth companies of all kinds, Pilot handles all of your company's accounting, tax, and bookkeeping needs, and is in fact now by far the largest startup focused accounting firm in the entire US.David: Also, we have to give our good buddy and Pilot CEO, Waseem Daher, a special shout out here because I think he is now the only Acquired sponsor CEO, who is also a source for an episode, because back when Waseem was a student at MIT, he interviewed Bill Gates for the school paper. He dug up the PDF and sent it to us. We're going to link to it in the episode sources.Ben: Yes. Very fun. Back to Pilot, and speaking of incredibly successful Seattle business people, we talk all the time on Acquired about Jeff Bezos' AWS-inspired axiom that startups should focus on what makes their beer taste better, i.e. only spend your limited time and resources on what is actually going to move the needle for you, your product, your customers, and outsource everything else that you need to do as a company but doesn't fit that bill.Accounting is example number one of what he's talking about. Every company needs this, but it needs to be done by a professional. You don't want to take any risk of something going wrong. But at the same time, it actually has zero impact on your product or your customers.David: So enter Pilot. Pilot both sets up and operates your company's entire financial stack, finance, accounting, tax, even CFO services like investor reporting from your general ledger, all the way up to budgeting and financial sections of your board decks. They've been doing this now for years across thousands of startups in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. There's nobody better who you can trust to both get finance right and make it easy and painless for your company.Ben: These are now companies like OpenAI, Airtable, Scale, as well as large ecommerce companies. It's not just that they have the experience across startups, they can also keep working with you as you scale to the growth phase and beyond. If your company wants to go back to focusing on what makes your beer taste better, go on over to pilot.com/acquired and tell them that Ben and David sent you.All right, David, why are we talking about the Mac?David: Because I think it's fair to say that the Mac made Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Office made the Mac. I don't think that it's actually a controversial statement, although it probably sounds crazy to many of you listening.Ben: Totally. Far and away the first thing to point out is the first version of Microsoft Excel was for the Mac. It's especially crazy for all the finance people today who are like, oh, Mac Excel isn't real Excel. Excel has to happen on Windows.David: No, Excel was on the Mac. That was it.Ben: Yes. The logic basically was Microsoft was really coming around to the idea that the next big thing in computing was the graphical user interface. The reason they were coming around to this was because they knew from Xerox PARC just as well as Apple did, and they were rapidly trying to figure out how to get All of that Xerox PARC-iness into their product line, too. That's the other half of this untold Xerox PARC story.One of the first ways that they see to bring the graphical user interface to their products is launching Excel for the Mac because they basically see, the way that we got destroyed with Lotus 1-2-3, we can't compete with lotus on the IBM PC, so we're going to shelf Multiplan start over, and Excel is going to come out in the graphical user interface. We're going to try to be first and best on the GUI.David: One thing just to underscore here, Excel is the world's first graphical spreadsheet program. That's why it wins, and that's why it's so important. Imagine trying to use Excel in the command line interface. That's what VisiCalc was, that's what even 1-2-3 was. Yeah, useful, better than nothing, but graphical charts, cells, visual relationships, this is so important. Excel is where it all starts.Ben: Yup. Of course, Apple loves this. The Macintosh came out in 1984, and everybody remembers the great intro video and the hello script. I've watched that Steve Jobs keynote because of course, I have, and it's this magical moment in computing history where finally something that's insanely great comes out. It's the beginning of Steve Jobs' unbelievable presentation prowess. It's so fun to watch it. It's, of course, a product that eventually people really loved. But at first...David: It doesn't have the killer app.Ben: No, it's a product that was supposed to ship in 1982. It didn't, it shipped in 1984. At the time, what they were targeting for 1982 was a pretty great set of technologies. By 1984, it's an aging set of technologies. It debuts with 128K of memory, which basically isn't enough to create any interesting applications. Developers are ignoring it as an interesting platform to develop on. Within 12 months, they figure it out and come out with a better version that's 512K. That's the version that people now really think about.David: That gets re-christened as like, that's the original Mac. The original original is the Mac 128 or something that.Ben: Exactly. But in the meantime, Microsoft, the applications group is working their ass off to make something really great for the Macintosh, and they come up with Excel. What ends up happening is Apple's really trying to promote the sales of this machine. They view Excel and PageMaker as the killer apps, as reasons that people should buy this thing, because once you run through a lot of the demo apps and the stuff that Apple built, you're like, okay, what else is here? It's crickets.David: Right. Writing hello in script is cool, but like a lot of VR stuff, you're like, oh, that's a cool demo, but you're going to do that every day? No.Ben: I'm not sure this has ever been publicly disclosed before, but Apple spent just as much marketing Excel as Microsoft did. They matched Microsoft's marketing spend with their own campaign for it and split the bill.David: That's amazing.Ben: You've got a couple of concurrent things going on in applications land. You've got Excel coming out for Mac to take advantage of the GUI. This strategy is just all over the place, I think that's an interesting thing to underscore about Microsoft in this era. They're trying a ton of stuff because they're paranoid. They don't want to miss the next wave. Meanwhile, also in the applications group, Charles Simonyi has written Word. This is about a year before in 1983. Microsoft Word comes out for DOS.David: Right, and they ship it with a mouse.Ben: Yes. This is like, okay, we see the Xerox PARC stuff coming out in the Mac. Great, Excel will be for that. We want to develop Word. We're going to do that for DOS. But I can imagine how useful the mouse is going to be in a word processing environment. They actually ship a mouse tied to the application that's not a part of DOS. This is how early we were in figuring out what the split between applications and platforms were at this point in history. Microsoft thought maybe a mouse makes sense just for this one application, even though it doesn't do anything else for the rest of the command line interface.David: It was all being figured out. I think it is also really fair to say that Microsoft was right there with Apple in the Mac development phase. Obviously, they're working on Excel, working on other what would become the Office Suite applications together for Mac.Steve Jobs shows Bill Gates the Mac project in 1981, three years before it ships. Microsoft and Apple signed an agreement to work together on applications for it in 1982. They were very deeply embedded on this, which is going to make the lawsuit and what comes up in a minute here all the more funny.Ben: The decision for the Excel team is to focus on GUI. The whole marketing message is Excel on a Mac is better than Lotus 1-2-3 on a PC. You're starting to see truly divergent cultures at Microsoft between the systems group, which is currently making DOS.We'll soon make Windows, soon partner with IBM, or soon do something else that we're getting into here in the next chapter of the story, and the applications group, which is also currently a bunch of disparate applications and teams targeting disparate platforms, but is also about to become unified in their next chapter. Within the applications group, that next chapter is Microsoft Office.In 1985, in January, the bundle is released. It was originally called the Business Pack for Microsoft. It started on the Mac.David: It really rolls off the tongue.Ben: Totally does. They haven't acquired PowerPoint yet or forethought as we talked about eight years ago on Acquired way back in history. There's no PowerPoint, it's not part of the bundle. What you've got here on the Mac and the first version of Office is Word, which they've developed in house, File, Chart, and Multiplan. This first notion of a suite, so today we're very familiar with suite—Creative Suite over at Adobe. Software is sold this way. This was the first time.What was actually happening is all of the bundling was happening in pricing, in marketing, and in manufacturing. You had a single box that they would ship with the different applications by 1988 or 1989. It was Word, Excel, PowerPoint. They're very different things, but they're getting bundled together in a way to be sold to customers, but there's no product integration.You don't have the ability to do this very nice copy-paste from an Excel table and just paste that into Word. That whole idea is pretty far away. In this earliest Microsoft Office, it was just, how can we bundle something for a cheaper price if you buy all three and make marketing easier for us to have this unified message?David: Soon to come—and we'll get into Windows here in a second—one of the big killer app for productivity in particular for business productivity with a graphical user interface like Windows and true multitasking, you can get copy-paste from Excel into PowerPoint. Lotus and the world back in the command line interface where you've got these programs running on top of DOS, that is a completely foreign concept.Ben: Right, none of those verbs exist.David: Exactly. We've now set the stage of Microsoft's doing a lot of stuff. They're hedging a lot of bets, they're not totally sure which strategy is going to win out, they're not sure which platform is going to win out. They're not sure if they're more of a systems company or an application company, but what they are unified on is we make great software for personal computers. I think anything that fell into that purview, they were willing to explore.They didn't really have hard boundaries between, we'll do anything to make our operating systems great, or we'll do anything to advantage our applications. Even we think we're an enterprise company, we think we're a consumer company. They just didn't have well formed opinions yet. It was just we make software for personal computers.David: At this point in time, the actual boundary between an operating system and an application is very fluid.Ben: You've got a mouse that works for one program.David: Totally. Lotus would really go down a dead end evolutionary path with Notes later in its life and its final chapter, where the application was going to be the operating system.Ben: Right. Lotus Notes was crazy. It was a word processor, an email service, and it was a platform on which you could write other applications.David: Yes, and it itself was an application.Ben: It's crazy.David: Not an operating system. It was all dynamic. Speaking of though, Microsoft here is in bed with Apple, working on the Mac. Bill and the company are big believers in the future of the graphical user interface. Starting in 1983, they're like, we got to do our own graphical operating system or at least user interface. This is the origins of the Windows product. They actually announced it in November, 1983, before the Mac ends up shipping, which their partner, Apple, is of course not happy about.Just development of the Mac was rocky, development of Windows was super freaking rocky within Microsoft, too. This is around that same time when Paul Allen gets Hodgkin's disease and leaves the company. His presence as great technical leader is very much missed, but they bring in someone from Xerox to manage the development of Windows.That person ends up not working out, he gets fired. Steve Ballmer gets drafted to come in and be the dev manager for the final push to release Windows 1.0, which is hilarious. You can find amazing YouTube videos from the launch and all joking about how non technical Steve coming in to Save the day and dev manage windows to launch.Ben: Which is so funny. I don't think at this point in history, the lines were clearly formed among the executives yet. Steve wasn't running the global sales force, and Microsoft wasn't an enterprise company.David: No, we're going to get to that later.Ben: Steve was one of the smart executives, they were a software company, and someone had to manage getting the software out the door. Windows 1.0 comes out. It's bad.David: It's bad. November 1985, Windows 1.0 is a very, very different thing than you imagine a graphical user interface is today or what you know of as Windows. It was tiled. It was not overlapping Windows that you can drag around and have one over the other. When you opened a program in Windows 1.0, the system created a literal window of it on your screen, and then it dynamically resized the windows as you open other applications. Nothing could ever be on top of each other. As you open more and more stuff, the windows get smaller and smaller and smaller. It's very bizarre.Ben: Yeah. The idea of windows overlapping on top of each other, that was a uniquely Mac thing and a thing that smart engineers at Apple figured out how to do that in a performant way that offers good user experience. I would classify Windows 1.0 as a half step between command line and an actual graphical user interface.David: Yes, 100%. I believe Microsoft and Apple actually did a licensing agreement while they were working together during this time that said, hey, Microsoft can use a lot of the stuff that's being developed for Mac for Windows 1.0.Ben: Yes, that's right. Apple does do a deal to license a lot of \"their intellectual property\" which of course came from Xerox, to Microsoft. Apple, I think, was under the impression that it was just for Windows 1.0, but the actual terms of the agreement are this and all future versions of Windows, which comes back to haunt Apple later. But yes, they totally get the license.David: Also, by the time that this agreement actually happens, I think Steve Jobs has been ousted, so it's Scully who does this agreement. People in Apple would look back on this for years and be like, this was a huge error.The other important thing about Windows during this awkward teenage phase is it's not an operating system. It's just a graphical interface on top of DOS.Ben: Yes.David: The original name for Windows was Interface Manager.Ben: Isn't it crazy? In all of their early marketing, they referred to it as Windows, a graphical operating environment that runs on the Microsoft MS-DOS operating system. Actually, it was not until Windows 95 that Windows was its own operating system. It was in Windows 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups. It was a graphical operating environment.Here's the question. Why is Microsoft doing Windows? Obviously here, Microsoft knows they need to evolve DOS. They need to figure something out for the graphical world. David, are you telling me that Windows is the widely agreed upon future of the company and that's just a straight line?David: Obviously that's a setup there. Here's the other thing that's happening in the company at this time, and it's the bigger thing. It's the next phase of the IBM relationship. Windows, the Mac, all of this, are hedges for the company. Microsoft and Bill, in particular, were masters of hedging their bets in an uncertain technology future.He was so great. The company was so great at making sure that whichever way the apple fell from the tree, as Jetson Huang put it to us in our interview, Microsoft was going to be positioned to catch it. A lot of people, including Bill and Microsoft themselves, believe that the way that apple was going to fall from the tree here was IBM and OS/2.Ben: The IBM PC was such a big deal last time around. You would think that whatever IBM wants to do next is a pretty good way to ally yourself.David: What's going on here? IBM, obviously the PC was a huge success, but losing dominance of the ecosystem to the clones, this was bad. IBM wants to find a way to evolve the PC ecosystem back to being more IBM proprietary. They're going to make Microsoft come along for the ride here.The way that they're going to do this is with the next generation of the PC ecosystem, they are going to make a whole new modern operating system. They're going to get rid of DOS. They're going to make this operating system in partnership with Microsoft, and it's going to be called, fittingly, OS/2. They are going to lock Microsoft up that they can't license it to anybody else. OS/2 is going to be proprietary to IBM hardware, just like the Mac operating system is proprietary to Apple hardware.As powerful as Microsoft's become here, they're still the little brother to IBM. This is not great news for Microsoft. On the other hand, it's much better for them to be on the inside here with IBM working in bed with them than it would be to be on the outside looking in if IBM's vision comes true and they recapture control of the PC ecosystem.Bill, Microsoft, the company, and Steve too as the manager of the account with IBM, commit themselves to Microsoft is all in on this vision of the future of OS/2, and IBM is our horse in the race.Ben: This is such a crazy part of the story to me, because we just talked about how Microsoft discovered this amazing business model. With everyone needing to license DOS from them, they're taking over the world, and they're becoming the standard development platform. Why on earth, if all that is true, are they going to develop some software that's going to be locked to IBM computers?David: This is a recentralization attempt. Ballmer has this great, great, great quote about it. He says, \"This,” the IBM partnership at this time, “was what we used to call riding the bear. You just had to try to stay on the bear's back and the bear would twist, turn, and try to throw you off. But we were going to stay on the bear because the bear was the biggest, the most important. You just had to be with the bear. Otherwise, you would be under the bear.\" That was IBM at this point in time.Really, I think it was IBM essentially putting a gun to Microsoft's head and being like, well, you can be in bed with us on this future that we're going to re-centralize everything, or you can be everybody else and not be, and you'll lose.Ben: Even though Microsoft's doing all these little hedges, Windows, this tiny little team that's 30 people or something, it's not the most prestigious place at the company. The people in the applications division may as well be on another planet by this point from the systems division. They're trying all kinds of crazy stuff. The company motto at this point is the next big thing is OS/2 and IBM, and we are the software vendor for that.David: Certainly Bill and I think Steve, too, they needed to tow the party line politically of expressing that, nope, OS/2 is the future. What we're doing with Windows and with the Mac is those are small things within the company. It's a super bizarre period in history, but IBM had also made a bit of a power play too with the later generations of the 16-bit era product they called the PC/AT. They used the Intel 286 chip instead of the Intel 386 chip. The 286 chip—this was an intentional decision on IBM's part—was good, but it wasn't great.Ben: You say it was good, but not great. Bill Gates said it was brain dead.David: Yes. Bill Gates called it a brain-dead chip.Ben: I think you might be being charitable.David: I think it certainly was more powerful than the 8086, 8088, but it was nowhere near what the 386 could do. There's a bunch of technical aspects to this, but the most important takeaway is that the 286 was not really powerful enough to do a graphical user interface or to power true multitasking in a way that the 386 and then later the 486 would be.A big part of actually the Compaq story about how Compaq and the clones leap ahead of IBM is they're not deterred from coming out with 386 machines, which are way more powerful, can run Windows, can do all this stuff. That's how they start to separate from IBM.Ben: That's right. That was a bet that company move where Microsoft was like, hey, Compaq, go make 386 stuff because we're going to make a really great 386 software. We need someone to be all in on that because IBM's not.David: This is the thing. Bill, Steve, and the company, they're having to tow the party line of expressing commitment to IBM, but really they're like, no, Compaq, go do the 386, we're going to do Windows.Ben: Right, they're riling up the rebels.David: Exactly. They are the rebels versus the empire here. Anyway, IBM, of course, sees all this. They made the decision not to go to 386 and to discourage it in the marketplace because they didn't want PCs to start creeping into the core enterprise mainframe IBM workloads, their core business. If that was going to happen, they wanted it to be IBM proprietary closed system. I think that was a big part of the impetus for this OS/2 initiative.Ben: I see.David: This is the empire strikes back here.Ben: They're basically trying to coop the PC movement back into IBM proprietary land.David: Exactly. When OS/2 finally does come out in December 1987, predictably, as you can imagine here, it's not very good. The market does not like it. Thank God for Microsoft. Again, this probably was Bill's strategy all along that they hedged with Windows, with the Mac. That's clearly the future. The market is not going to accept OS/2 and a recentralization on IBM. Microsoft's just crushing it on the revenue side, even though OS/2 is a failure.Ben: DOS and the applications were both great businesses by 1987.David: Yes. Fiscal 1987, Microsoft does $350 million in revenue. Fiscal 1988, they do $600 million in revenue. Basically, none of this is from OS/2 and the IBM world. Towards the end of 1988 is when the wind starts really blowing away from IBM here.In June of 1988, Microsoft hires Mike Maples, who is IBM's director of software strategy away from IBM to come head Microsoft's application software. What is Microsoft's application software strategy right now? It's the graphical user interface. It's everything that IBM isn't. The writing is starting to be on the wall here that divorce is coming between IBM and Microsoft.Finally, a year-and-a-half later in 1990, Windows 3.0 comes out. This is when they get it right. This is when there's enough installed base of 386 and 486 machines out there in the open PC ecosystem that you can have a really good, true multitasking, good UI, graphical user interface running on top of DOS.Windows 1.0 and Windows 2.0 only ever achieved 5% penetration of the DOS installed base. Windows 3.0 doubles that in the first six months. PC Computing magazine writes about Windows 3.0. May 22nd, 1990 will mark the first day of the second era of IBM compatible PCs. Microsoft released Windows 3.0.On that day, the IBM compatible PC, a machine hobbled by an outmoded character-based operating system and 70s style programs, was transformed into a computer that could soar in a decade of multitasking graphical operating environments, aka everything OS/2 is not. Windows 3.0 gets right what its predecessors got wrong. It drives adequate performance, it accommodates existing DOS applications, and it makes you believe that it belongs on a PC.Ben: That's awesome.David: That's what the press thought. Ben, I know you talked to a really important person in the Windows ecosystem and Microsoft internally at this time. What do you have for us?Ben: We have to thank Brad Silverberg for helping us with this section. Brad led the Windows 3.1 team. He came in right after the 3.0 release and would eventually go on to lead the Windows 95 effort as the VP of the Personal Systems Division.Brad comes in, Windows 3.0 has just shipped. The first thing that is super, super obvious is as Brad observed everything going on with OS/2 land and everything going on with the core Microsoft culture, it was a complete clash. It was impossible for the pace of Microsoft. This is a super young group, all in their 20s. Some people in their 30s, but mostly 20s who just want to push the cutting edge, ship stuff.Think about Google in the early 2000s, just hire all the smartest people you can, set them loose, have creativity, and bump up against the edge of what's possible, both in terms of pushing the hardware, but also pushing even laws as we would later see. Let's just do what users love and see what happens. Let's just do what technology enables us to do and see what happens. That's the opposite of IBM's culture at this point. There's this huge cultural rift between what IBM needs and who Microsoft is at this point.What ended up happening with 3.0, it was unexpectedly loved. Microsoft was not really prepared for how much people were going to love the GUI, and with 3.1 it got really good. There was a small off site of the executives, and Bill and Steve basically decided that it was time to bet on Windows. That was the new strategy. Windows had always been plan B, and now suddenly it was plan A.When I say plan B, I don't mean thought they had a prayer of being plan A. It was 65 people that shipped windows 3.1. These were the misfits. It was not prestigious. The prestigious thing to work on at Microsoft was OS/2 and eventually Windows NT. But the Windows team in the Windows 3.0 era is almost the Mac team over at Apple. They were flying the rebel flag, they valued creativity over bureaucracy, even if it meant they weren't working on the prestigious thing.Suddenly, there's this huge strategic opportunity to become the standard independent of IBM if the platform is good enough, and then boom. The early reception to Windows is so good, it gives this glimmer of, that may seem really ambitious, but that opportunity is actually ours if we want to go seize it. Everyone took a big gulp and said, the GUI's the next big thing, users love this, let's take the ragtag group and promote them.David: This was, I think, the moment when Microsoft started to believe in themselves, really. If you look at the facts as we told the story, it was like, Bill did this great business deal with IBM, anticipated the rise of the clones in the first PC, won, and then Microsoft now was the thing, and IBM was the old thing. It wasn't until this. In this whole OS/2 thing, I think you can see, they felt like they were still little brother. They had to go along with what IBM dictated. Now they're like, whoa.Ben: Why do we again?David: Yeah, we're in control.Ben: The press is making a big deal out of Bill Gates. Boy Wonder, he's the youngest ever billionaire at age 31. By the way, when Bill Gates became a billionaire, there were not lots of billionaires, there were 50 billionaires. All this lore around the company, it's like they can do no wrong. But inside the company, I think they're like, we don't know the future of technology. Any wave could break against us at any moment, and this is all tenuous. I think that chasm kept getting wider and wider and wider of internally feeling like they're screwed and externally it's seeming this is the next great thing.David: Totally. I've got some fun stats on money and revenue around all this. In fiscal 1990, the year that Windows 3.0 shipped, Microsoft does $1.2 billion in revenue, making them the first software company ever to pass a billion dollars in revenue. Fiscal 1991, they do $1.8 billion. Fiscal 1992, they finally win the Apple copyright lawsuit around the GUI.Ben: By the way, the way that they won that, a judge basically looked at the paper and said, Apple, you totally said in all the future versions of Windows, they can use your UI paradigms. For most of the counts, they're covered. For these other things that you're trying to ask them about, those are not actually defensible. It's just widely accepted that these are UI paradigms now, and you can't enforce any ownership over those. It basically got thrown out. Apple tried to appeal all the way up to the Supreme Court, who said no.David: That's right. Like we've been saying too, they both stole from Xerox.Ben: Yes.David: Fiscal 1992 though, this is when Microsoft just blows the doors off. They do $2.8 billion in revenue in fiscal 1992, up from $1.8 the year before. That year, 1992 in October is when Gates finally passes John Kluge—Acquired OG fans, back to the LVMH episode—Gates passes John Kluge of Metromedia fame, media mogul to become the wealthiest person in America. Everything you're talking about, all the press comes around that.In January 1993, the crowning moment happens. Microsoft passes IBM in market cap. They have inherited the earth. They have inherited computing. Supposedly. I don't know if this is 100% true. This is written in one of the books I read. I read this. The folks involved will have to confirm or deny.Supposedly, the next month after Microsoft passes IBM in market cap—we're now in February 1993—the IBM board is in disarray. The empire is going down. They fired the CEO. Tom Murphy of Capital Cities fame who is on the IBM board, supposedly comes out to Redmond to sit down with Bill and personally ask him to come and be the next CEO of IBM.Ben: No way.David: Yes. This is what I read. I don't know if this actually happened, but this is what I read.Ben: Is that in Hard Drive?David: That's in Hard Drive, yeah.Ben: Wow. Listeners, there are some unauthorized biographies that we tried to corroborate as many of the facts as we can. But the ones where David's saying he doesn't know a source, it's these unauthorized ones.David: Yes. Gates obviously declines that. Whether or not that actually happened, spiritually, you could believe that happened. Bill and Microsoft are the new emperor here. This carries through to this day. We're going to tell in the next episode here, the antitrust, the fall, and all that, but not really. Microsoft's still the most valuable company in the world. They inherited the throne from IBM. It happens right here.Ben: It's nuts. Suddenly, Microsoft feels the full weight of everything that you have to do to build a platform and be a steward of an ecosystem. Suddenly, this huge effort began to try and make developers successful. That's how Windows would be successful if it was a great platform for application developers to thrive on.Cameron Myhrvold led the developer relations group basically to try and figure out, what do people want out of a platform, and how do we provide the APIs for them, the support, and everything in order to do that, all the documentation, all the help, everything? At the same time, Microsoft basically knew establishing a platform is brutal and requires bootstrapping a multi sided network of developers, users, and PC manufacturers.So 3.1 had users excited, but it was still very early. They could have lost that throne. Developers were not really yet targeting Windows. Microsoft had to show, we make great applications for Windows, too. The applications group really had to start doing Windows 3.1.David: Right, because developers were targeting DOS at this point. They were probably preparing for OS/2. Some of them were targeting the Mac, Microsoft itself, but nobody was targeting Windows.Ben: Exactly. You've got this big developer relations group effort that spins up. Meanwhile, there's a huge push with OEMs to get them to install Windows. At this point, they were still installing DOS or some people were actually installing nothing and requiring users to put operating systems on. There's a conceded push to get the OEMs to install 3.1.David: Yeah, and there are some people installing nothing. We should mention here, around this same time, this era, they move a lot of their OEM deals to a per processor licensing fee arrangement, which gets them in a lot of hot water with antitrust a few years later.Ben: Okay, this happened from 1988 to 1994. David, explain the per processor licensing agreement.David: Here's how Microsoft (I think) would position it to their OEM partners. You could pay us a license fee for every machine you ship with DOS installed on it, or DOS and Windows. You can offer other OSes too. But rather than that arrangement, we'll give you a cheaper per unit deal because you're going to ship DOS on everything. DOS is the standard, and we want Windows to be the standard, and Windows is going to be the standard.We'll make it more economically attractive to you, give you a lower per unit rate. If we just change the terms and say, instead of every unit you ship with, DOS or with Windows, every machine you ship, period, every microprocessor based machine that you ship, no matter what operating system is installed on us, just pay us a per processor rate. If you do that, you'll be paying us for every machine, whether you ship DOS or Windows on it or not, but you're going to ship DOS and Windows anyway.Ben: You may as well take the cheaper rate.David: You may as well take the cheaper option. Obviously, what effect does this have on competition? There's now a very, very, very strong incentive never to ship any other operating system.Ben: Yeah. Basically, you're going to pay for two different operating systems, even though you're only putting one on if you ever load a different operating system on. Yes, it very strongly incentivizes you to never ever ever ship any other operating systems on your computers as a company.This is of course the way that regulators would look at it in 1994. That would get Microsoft in some hot water, and they had to agree to stop doing this practice. The way Microsoft would look at it is, we're just helping our customers. Do you really think that these companies want to keep a whole separate ledger of what machines they shipped DOS on or Windows on versus what machines they shipped period? Wouldn't it just be easier if once a month or once a quarter, they could just report to us their total shipments like they have to report to their investors anyway, and then we'll just send them an invoice for all their machines?David: Totally. While antitrust and the government would seize onto this as a smoking gun, I think the reality is this was irrelevant in terms of the forces that made DOS and Windows the winners. They were already the winners by the time they started doing this.Ben: If this had happened earlier, you could see how this would be more of a compelling way to get market share. But by the time they started doing it, they were already running away with the market.David: Yes. Speaking of this new customer-friendly, buyer-friendly business practice from Microsoft, which I think is how they thought about it...Ben: Totally. They wanted to make the stuff that people wanted to use the most, and that's how they would win. Their goal was make the very best products, the best software we possibly can in the ways that people want to use and buy software, and then we'll make a bunch of money.David: Yup. As this changing of the guard is happening from IBM to Microsoft, I think part of this new self confidence from Microsoft is, wait a minute, why can't we go win the enterprise too and take that from IBM? We don't have to get in bed with them to sell to the enterprise. We should sell to the enterprise.Ben: The thing they were realizing is, well, we have made software that people like to use, so they're using it in businesses. They always wanted that to be the goal, but now it was happening. People are doing their work in Excel. People are bringing PCs to the office.Maybe businesses are buying their PCs, but people are actually buying them themselves and using them in the office. It just made them that much more efficient. Microsoft really had to figure out how to sell to businesses, but we actually have no idea how to do that. It sounds crazy today. The Microsoft you know today, as late as the mid-90s, really had no idea how to sell or build software for businesses.David: Totally. This is the first half of the original Microsoft vision statement coming true, a PC on every desk and in every home. Desk means work, means enterprise. In this era, everybody we talk to, gives 100% of the credit to Steve Ballmer.Steve took it on his shoulders at this point in time when Microsoft is passing IBM to say, I am going to build, and we are going to learn as a company how to sell to enterprises. Ben, like you're saying, it's impossible to imagine now Microsoft not like this, but there's so much that they needed to do that they didn't have.Ben: In part because prior to this, personal computers were not used by enterprises. It was just not an enterprise tool. Now that it was happening, Microsoft had to figure out how to be the ones that would benefit from it.David: That meant selling to the C-suite at global Fortune 500 companies, most of whom did not use computers.Ben: Correct. Certainly, it didn't want to buy operating systems one at a time.David: Right. To the extent, members of the C-suite like CIOs or proto IT organizations used computers or were the computing centers in the company, they hated the PC. It made their life hard. This was when employees would bring a PC to work, plop it down on their desk, and start mucking around with stuff. It made things hard.Ben: And there really isn't yet a business server that couples nicely with the PC on the desk. You have this weird thing where there's a mainframe that is where the company's real enterprise applications run, but people are bringing PCs. Those PCs don't actually communicate well with anything else yet. They just are there for the employee to do their own work on a spreadsheet or something, print it out because finally 3.1 had printer drivers, and then deliver that. But it wasn't a system that operated with other systems in your enterprise.David: There's no email. This really was a business transformation task for the global Fortune 500.Ben: It wasn't like, hey, let's sell something to businesses that they want to buy. It's, hey, let's convince businesses that PCs are a good idea for their workforce to adopt.David: This was partnering with the consulting firms. This was building a direct sales force within Microsoft. This is building an indirect sales force within Microsoft to partner with distribution partners, with channel partners, with independent software vendors. This is building a customer service organization. This is building the executive briefing center on the Microsoft campus, and bringing CEOs and other C-suite folks there to Microsoft. It's building solutions for them, it's becoming a partner. It's everything that Steve is frankly just born to do.Ben: All of this stuff is pretty out of scope for this episode, including all the software systems you would need to build for the enterprise like Windows NT server, Exchange, SQL server, and Active Directory, the classic mid-2000s Microsoft stuff that they got known for. That is what this would all evolve into, and it really just started with everyone looking at Steve and saying, can you figure this out?We've all to date basically just been either running dev teams, running marketing, or running product groups, and been selling through retail or distributors in the application side or mostly through OEMs on the systems and operating system side. But can you go figure out how to sell everything we make in a completely different way to a completely different buyer profile and keep us posted on how that needs to change all the products we make in order to do that? That's a pretty crazy change.David: Yup. How it actually goes down, and we heard this from Steve and you heard it from other people, is so fitting. By the end of 1990, the Microsoft-IBM divorce is official. IBM takes full control of OS/2 development back from Microsoft. Microsoft ceases involvement. The breakup is official. This now gives Microsoft and Steve hunting license in the enterprise to go compete against IBM, but they have a secret weapon that is going to enable them to come take the enterprise from IBM. Ben, tell us what it is.Ben: It's painfully obvious. It's Microsoft Office, and it's the fact that the whole workforce is already using Microsoft Office. Everyone loves to talk about product-led growth and how it's this new thing in the late 2010s, how Slack, Atlassian, Trello, and everyone figured out PLG. This bottoms-up workforce-adopted way, rather than selling to procurement, IT, or the central administrator. And it's just not new.David: No. This has always been the case, and Microsoft invented it.Ben: All the employees wanted to use Excel and Word. They were doing it anyway. At some point Microsoft needed to figure out how to take advantage of selling it centrally and how you do business with other businesses, rather than selling a zillion retail copies of people who are using it illegally for their work.David: There's so many things that are beautiful about this. It's the legacy of this bet on the Mac, bet on Excel, and bet on Windows shortly thereafter, that enables Microsoft to go into the enterprise because even though they've just broken up with IBM and OS/2 isn't going anywhere, it's not like Steve can just go knock on the door of some banking CEO or C suite and be like, I'm Microsoft, come talk to me about how you're going to use Microsoft products in your organization. But rather it's like, hey, thousands of people in your organization are already using Excel. Let's have a conversation about how we can make that work better for your organization, and what else Microsoft can do for you.Ben: Absolutely. Next episode is going to be all about the enormous success of becoming an enterprise company, the enterprise agreement, cloud, and everything that came after that. But we have two chapters left in this episode, and they happen concurrently within the systems group by two very, very different teams, and that is Windows 95 and Windows NT.David, let's start with NT, and then our little cherry on top can be 95 to close us out. How did Windows NT happen?David: Perfect, and it's intertwined with the beginning of all this enterprisification of Microsoft. Okay, Windows NT. Remember, IBM's whole goal with OS/2 was that they saw the trajectory of the PC was going to eat into traditional mainframe type applications in the enterprise. They wanted to recentralize and own the PC enterprisification of workloads. NT is, after the divorce, Microsoft being like, screw that we're going to do the same thing and eat your lunch.The initial work starts out of the work they had been doing on OS/2 with IBM. But then in October 1988, as they're heading towards divorce, Microsoft hires Dave Cutler away from DEC. Dave is an absolute beast and legend. He's still writing code at Microsoft today, which is amazing.Ben: Isn't that crazy? He's in his 80s.David: Amazing. Dave at DEC wrote the whole operating system that DEC ran on VAX. Poaching him away to come work at Microsoft, he's the guy that's going to build an enterprise-ready, take share away from the way traditional enterprise computing is done onto the PC. He's got the chops to do this, he's also got the credibility to do this.Ben: He's written a widely-deployed enterprise operating system.David: Yes. Him coming to Microsoft, him leading and building this effort, gives Steve and the sales force so much legitimacy when they're going in and talking to the C-suites, the CIOs, the IT departments, and enterprises.Ben: Even though they don't yet have an enterprise product to sell, they've got DOS and early Windows, which is essentially consumer-targeted, but now they've got this guy, Dave.David: Yes, now they've got Dave.Ben: We should say, this is really the first time they brought in someone who had real industry experience. In 1988, Microsoft was 13 years old, so Bill Gates would have been 33. Everyone is in their late 20s and early 30s, and Dave's mid-40s. He's like, you know I've seen a few things.David: I think it was Dave and also Mike Maples coming from IBM too. Mike obviously wasn't a technical leader but on the business and strategy side, too. NT, we'll talk a lot more about it on the next episode. But spoiler alert, it is the vision of what IBM wanted OS/2 to be, but it's Microsoft's version of it.Ben: It enables all of your desktop computers at the company to join and network together in a compliant way. It enables an internal server that everything communicates with. It enables a directory of all the devices on the network and all the people in your organization.David: Soon with the Internet coming, it'll enable servers that face externally from your company. The punchline here is that NT becomes the seeds of Windows Server, the business line, which become the seeds of Azure today.Ben: The other important takeaway on NT is it was going to take a long time to build. It was going to take a long time to test. It was going to take a long time to sell and deploy, and it was going to have really strict requirements for what it could work on because it's a power hungry operating system built for enterprise IT administrators. That is not your short-term product strategy. That is a long-term bet that a team is going to work on concurrently while you're figuring out what to do after Windows 3.1.In 1991, Bill Gates sums this up in a memo where he says, “Our strategy is Windows. One evolving architecture, a couple of implementations, and an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others.” Every word in that sentence does a bunch of heavy lifting.You got one architecture. Okay. I think what that basically ends up meaning a few years later is one application programming interface (API) that developers can target so that when they want to write a Windows app, it works on both NT and whatever the evolution of 3.1 is. That's one architecture, but it says one evolving architecture. That buys Microsoft a little bit more fluidity in the one architecture that's being targeted.Then you hear a couple of implementations. This basically says, even though developers are targeting what became the Win32 API, the one way that we write applications, there are two different implementations. For many years, they would display very differently on NT systems versus—spoiler alert—Windows 95, the successor to Windows 3.1.David: By Windows 95, you mean Windows 4 that was supposed to ship in 1993?Ben: Yes, I do, but it's so much sexier to say Windows 95 and name it after the year that it actually ships. Yes, an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others sheds light on the DRG (Developer Relations Group) strategy. We got to go out and be massive evangelists, and everyone in the systems group is looking over at the apps group going, did you see that? Bill Gates just said our strategy is Windows. We're now the Windows company, and that includes great applications from Microsoft and others.What does that mean, applications group? Let's go first and best on Windows, get to it. I just think that sentence says it all for what we're looking at 1991 through call it 2000 or so.David: Yup. We just spent a bunch of time talking about the enterprisification and all the amazing enterprise stuff that the seeds get sewn from Microsoft at this point in time. This era is also the heyday of the consumer PC. In 1993, Jensen starts NVIDIA, graphics cards are becoming a thing. PC gaming is becoming an industry. You can even look at Minesweeper as being a seminal moment in terms of the consumerization, these devices, these personal computers becoming companions to people's lives like the phone is today. You've got CD-ROM technology, multimedia, Encarta. The heyday of the consumer PC is here in this era.Ben: Totally. Even before Windows 95 shipped, they had 75 million Windows users. This is even before you get plug-and-play, multimedia, or networking. This is on Windows 3.1. Crazy.We've been leading up to what we've been building hype, Windows 95, or should I say Chicago? The Chicago name, for those of you out there who were paying attention when this was under development, and you were all excited about what Windows 95 would become—and it's probably 1% of our audience or something who knows the Chicago code name—they wanted to create an OS for the everyman, one that was easy to get to, a nice quality of life when you're there, it was affordable. Chicago is the perfect name in every way. It is also a contrast to what was going on in a different part of Microsoft, where there was the codename of Cairo for a very ambitious next generation operating system.Mind you, NT had already come out in 1993. Cairo is this general bucket of maybe it's post-NT, maybe it's part of NT, but this is a really sophisticated, crazy set of technologies that we're going to eventually bake into an operating system. It doesn't really have a release date. No one really believes in any of the release dates that are proposed.The Windows 95 team, the Windows 4 team, the Chicago team, loved contrasting this idea of a far flung land that's really ambitious. Who knows what it'll actually be like? Chicago is something we know quite well. You get on I-90 from Seattle, you drive for three days, and you're there. That is the goal. That's the spiritual thing about Windows 95.David: Pizza, the bears, the cubs.Ben: 100%. We should say, Cairo never shipped, so there's a lesson in that.David: Might as well been called Oz.Ben: Or Longhorn.David: Right. Okay, all right, we're getting ahead of ourselves.Ben: We are getting ahead of ourselves. Windows 95, let's start with the launch event itself. It was a huge, ridiculous, insane day in Redmond, Washington. They set up tents all over Microsoft's campus. They flew in journalists, beta testers. There was a movement around Windows 95 in a way that you would not believe. It was an operating system launch, and Jay Leno launched it. It wasn't like Jay Leno did some stand up, it was Jay Leno for 90 minutes in a tightly scripted environment, co-hosted with Bill Gates all of the fanfare and festivities.David: There is no other word to describe the Windows 95 launch besides glorious. I am so glad that this stuff is preserved on the Internet and on YouTube, and that we could experience it ourselves over the past month.Ben: It might be the peak moment of pure joy to celebrate technology before a lot of the skepticism came in and the tech haters.David: The DOJ.Ben: Totally. It was unabashed celebration of software is probably the best way to put it. Microsoft license Start Me Up famously from the Rolling Stones.David: It's amazing, a software company licensed Start Me Up by the Rolling Stones as the official theme song of an operating system. The idea that this would be happening, certainly back in 1975 when they were moving to Albuquerque, but even just a couple of years earlier, this is breaking new ground.Ben: Totally. The other thing that's happening in 1995 is the Internet hype is starting to build, but we will table that for next episode. Right at this point in history, only 14% of Americans had internet access. It was still very early, so there was no guarantee that any story posted online would actually reach the masses. Microsoft had really relied on traditional broadcast coverage of this event, and brought in all these journalists, all these print magazines, and all these newspapers to build the hype.I watched the whole keynote yesterday. At the end, they ripped down the back of the tent behind the stage. There's the entire development team in the red, yellow, green, and blue squares of the Windows logo sitting outside on the big sports field on Redmond's campus. There's only 360 people that built Windows 95, so it's still a small team, but they're all there. They're fired up. They're part of the moment. That's the launch event in Redmond, at least.Around the world, people are lined up around the block to buy an operating system. There's a lot of news coverage of that. It was basically the iPhone launch of its day. They lit up the CN Tower, the Tower of London. This date, August 24th, 1995, they basically treated an operating system launch the way that you would launch a movie or a new Madonna album. It was a marketing case study, so much so that the folks from Coca-Cola actually reached out to Microsoft to ask them, how do you do marketing this well in the new age?David: To the Bill Gates quote with the Warren Buffett talk at U-Dub.Ben: Yes. This is a company that freaking invented Santa Claus to sell us all sugar water, and they're calling Microsoft asking, how do you market in this new era? It was that successful. They launched concurrently worldwide in eight languages. This thread that Microsoft had of early international continued all the way through to this moment. They invested heavily in doing all of the localization and help stuff so that the whole world really could adopt something all at one time. It really was the perfect product at the right time, the Internet, games, all of that.David: There's so much about Windows 95 too that I'm sure you're going to get into, but the start menu. It was so perfect because this was the peak of the PC going fully mainstream. Nobody had ever treated software like this before.Ben: That's the takeaway. They thought about software in a completely different way. Yes, the start menu, while it got cluttered, complicated, and messed up over time, the idea of a button that you click to start using your computer was very appealing to people.David: Totally. The Mac obviously shared a lot of these elements, but it was at so much a smaller scale.Ben: The Mac just never had any real PC penetration. From the IBM PC forward, it never had big market share.David: This was your grandmother coming into the digital world.Ben: That is how they tried to market it. They market it as people on job sites using Windows. They marketed it as people doing crafts. There's someone who's modeling something for an F1 car. It's just fun watching all these old videos and seeing all the different personas.David: Computer companies love F1 cars for demos. It's the ultimate aspirational demo.Ben: I must say this all pains me deeply as someone who never owned a PC, grew up using a Mac, loved every bit of my Mac. I was even an apologist in the OS-9 era of this isn't very good, but I'm still going to say it's good. I was on the OS-10 public beta. I only clicked a start menu when I was fixing a teacher's computer at school. Even though the takeaway here is everyone thought this was a great operating system and it won the market, I always looked at it like, well, it's not a Mac.David: That's how Mac users always look at Windows.Ben: The way that Apple products became mainstream always felt odd to me as someone who was using them when they weren't, but it's been interesting gaining a new appreciation for Microsoft through studying their history that I absolutely did not have as a user during this era.David: Having this discussion now makes me think, Windows 95, they did what Apple tried to do in bringing Scully in. Scully came from Pepsi. Obviously, that didn't work, but Microsoft, they're the ones who did it. They're the ones who mass-marketified the computing vision.Ben: It was the wrong strategy for Apple, and it was the right strategy for Microsoft. Apple has always, at least in my opinion, created a better computing experience by being completely integrated. It's the Alan Kay quote, \"Anyone who cares about making great software needs to build their own hardware.\" The complete integrated package that Apple offers, I have always found to be the best computing experience. And it doesn't scale.David: It didn't in that era for sure.Ben: In that era, yeah. The way to scale is Make the software that is going to get distributed on the most PCs, and then that is the most interesting to software developers. It is the most interesting to consumers who want the software and IT buyers who want to buy the standard thing. Apple's strategy versus Microsoft strategy in this era, Apple was always going to be a bit player rather than the scale winner.The trade off is lots of PCs had blue screens of death, Apple never had blue screens of death. Where do blue screens come from? It's driver problems. It's that the printer is not speaking the same language as your particular computer and what the operating system knows about your computer, and are the device drivers right for your particular version of whatever's on your motherboard? Apple never had those issues, but they also had very few units shipped and much more expensive product.David: Sidebar. That Alan Kay quote about if you really care about software, you do your own hardware, makes so much more sense to me now having done this episode, because he's coming from having made the Alto and the graphical interface there. The only way that he could have made the GUI on the Alto was basically building a mini computer.Ben: Isn't that crazy?David: It makes so much more sense now.Ben: A little bit more on Windows 95 before we finish the story here, it is remarkable to reflect that it took 5–6 years to go from Windows' plan B to Microsoft being extremely right that that was the franchise, that was the bet to bet the entire company on.As Brad Silverberg put it this way to me, he said, Windows 95 cemented Windows as the franchise product for Microsoft, which interestingly it was not yet. David, this is crazy. It would remain the franchise product for the next 20 years, perhaps 5 or 10 years too long, but we'll save that story.David: Yeah. Just to put some numbers on this, August 24th, 1995 is the launch event, the glorious day. Windows 95 comes out. It sells a million copies in the first week, seven million copies in the first month.Fiscal 1995—this is the 12 months ending in June before Windows 95 comes out—Microsoft did $5.9 billion in revenue. Fiscal 1996, they did $8.7 billion. Fiscal 1997 when Windows 95 is really going, they do $12 billion in revenue. First software company to pass $10 billion in revenue, already the most valuable company in the world. They are a monster. There is no other way to put it.Ben: It's crazy. From a product perspective, there was just so much really got smoothed here. This was a user experience where they finally had time to think, what actually do users want to do with an operating system? What features should be part of the OS, and what should we delegate to applications? What are modern networking technologies that we should bring in?I don't want to foreshadow too much, but how should the Internet be in a modern operating system? That was a huge thing. The multimedia, the video stuff. An operating system really showed up and said, we thought about this experience for you. You're looking for where to start, you're looking for cool stuff to do, and you're looking for it to not break on you. We now finally have a complete story around all of that.A couple of interesting technical notes, it was basically all new technology. If you try to look this up, it will tell you, Windows 95 was DOS-based. It still used DOS in fallback situations for older DOS applications or drivers. But for most of the time, it was no longer true that Windows was just an operating environment on top of the DOS operating system.Windows had now become a true 32-bit operating system of its own. Windows did all the heavy lifting. It had its own file system. It accomplished a lot of the user experience magic and speed that it was praised for by rewriting a lot of this from scratch. This was the beginning of Windows as its own OS. You can see that actually change in the marketing messages that change from operating environment to operating system.David, that brings us to the end of our chapter one. We've got plenty of analysis here to do, but my God, what a first 20 years for the company.David: We knew this was going to happen. This is why we waited 10 years into Acquired's life to cover Microsoft. It's the most important company in the world still today.It was so fun researching, going back and doing all this because there are so many different perspectives, and so much has been written. I don't know if we've gotten it right here, but I feel like every other major attempted storytelling at this has not gotten it right. Getting to go talk to all the people who were part of this...Ben: Yeah, living in Seattle is quite helpful.David: Yeah. We really got that sense of like, there's still a story to be told here. It's never been more relevant again than today. All that to say, I'm glad we waited 10 years.Ben: And there's all this stuff we miss. I didn't mention Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research was a lot of people and a lot of money.David: Microsoft tried to buy Intuit too along the way. That got canned.Ben: Actually, the start of research is interesting. I'll say this real quick. In 1991, Nathan Myhrvold started Microsoft Research, and the logic is fascinating. Basically, everything Microsoft had done until that point was taking things from mainframes and mini computers, and adapting those tasks, those jobs to be done for personal computers.At some point, they looked around and said, all right, well, we did it. All the personal and business applications can now be run on personal computers, so we have to come up with uses for future technologies in order to continue to drive the ecosystem forward. There's no more low hanging fruit. I thought that was an interesting thesis of why to spin up a research division at that point in history.David: Yes. Let's move into analysis.Ben: Okay, great. Playbook. The big interesting one that I want to start with, and it actually involves a chapter from the story that we just glossed over, is capital efficiency allows founders to control their own destinies in a way that you just don't get when you're selling off huge chunks of the company in order to accomplish your mission.David: Yes, I love this.Ben: Let's just talk through the cap table over time and how the company went public. We talked about the partnership being 64% Gates, 36% Paul Allen. In 1980, Steve Ballmer comes in and gets 8.5%, 8.75%, or something that percent of the company, so dilutes Gates and Allen down.In 1981, just a year later, they take the VC investment for 5% of the company from TVI. This also, I'm guessing around 5% trying to reverse engineer some of the numbers. They also created an option pool, where they were then creating opportunity for basically rewarding management, which is how there were 10,000 millionaires created in the Seattle area from Microsoft.David: That's the amazing thing. The option pool doesn't get created until late in Microsoft's life. All those Microsoft millionaires only came from whatever size that was, 5% of the company or whatever.Ben: At IPO, even with all this dilution, you've got the Ballmer dilution, the VC dilution, and the option pool dilution, Bill Gates still owned 49% of the company. That's pretty unprecedented. He wasn't the only one with a big chunk. Paul Allen owned 28% of the company. Steve had 7.5% of the company.This company was basically owned by the three more or less co-founders. A little tiny option pool, and then a VC who ended up with 6.1%. I think Dave got some more shares from being on the board. You just don't see companies that look this anymore.David: This is Bill's company. This is their company in a way that no other company is these days. No venture-backed company going through the modern era is like that. By the time you get to be public, you may still be the largest shareholder as a founder or CEO, but it's not your company, far from it.Ben: Absolutely. I'm trying to figure out why they were able to be so capital efficient. Is it just that software was such an unbelievably good business model compared to everything else that existed? They didn't need a lot of working capital, everything was high margin, they could grow really fast. Or it was just an era before much competition. They didn't need to out-raise their competitors. Once they got a little bit ahead, there was really no way for anybody else to close the gap, assuming that they executed well.David: I totally think it's the latter. I think it's that the minimum fixed cost threshold to be that, in Bill's words, slightly better than your competitors and get the positive spiral going, was low enough that it could be paid for just in Bill and Paul's time and effort. There was that unique moment at the beginning of the software industry where that was true, and that would never be true again.Ben: That's so, so, so insane. There was no one else really with the knowledge either. Even if someone else came in with a big $1 million check and gave it to a competitor, in 1975, how many people could really write these language interpreters?David: You couldn't buy the experience having written emulation software for microprocessors that Paul had.Ben: They had an obsession and an obscure skill that turned out to be one of the most valuable in the world in an area where there was a freak law of nature in play with Moore's Law that was so unintuitive, that you had to think from real first principles to understand the impacts of it.David: I think there are two freak laws of nature's one. (1) There was Moore's law that they were benefiting from. (2) There was the zero marginal cost of software.Ben: That's true. It's this complete perfect storm that enabled them to build a highly defensible business without really any investment ever. This is the largest company in the world, the most valuable company in the world that was entirely bootstrapped.David: Even though they raised money, not a single dollar of investment actually happened at this company.Ben: No, and in 1986, when they actually did go public, they raised $45 million. They never spent that because they generated much more free cash flow than that that year.David: It was just a means to an end of getting public.Ben: And they needed to for the reason that they had been granting so many stock options from that little option pool to employees that they were going to blow the SEC's 500 shareholder cap. They projected 1987, so they wanted to go public on their own terms in 1986, not when they had to buy SEC rules.David: Also, Microsoft needed to be a public company. If you're going to be an important company in the world at this scale, if you're going to first ride the bear with IBM but then inherit the earth from IBM, you got to be a public company. You can't be a private partnership. You're not going to go have conversations with C-suites and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies if you are a private partnership in this era especially.Ben: Maybe. I don't know. I'd agree with you if you had a bunch of short-term capital interests that owned your company, but if it's all founder-owned, there are great, large private companies in the world.David: Yeah, fair, true.Ben: Coke Industries is a trusted company by a whole bunch of their customers. Cargill is even bigger than that. There's a bunch of European industrial and shipping companies. Rolex. There are privately-held, big, important companies in the world.David: For sure, but none of those companies are Microsoft.Ben: That's true. That's very fair. Especially getting to the stage that they eventually got to being the trusted partner to governments around the free world, that requires being a public company.David: It's funny. This playbook theme, this was a moment in time and a set of factors where this worked. I guess the lesson is find an industry in its infancy, be capital-efficient, and run the table.Ben: That has unique economic conditions that have never existed before to create these magical businesses you could never fathom before this new technology thing existed? It's an impossible thing to wish for. It may never happen again. We may never get another Google either.David: That's what I was going to say, it did happen again, it happened with Google.Ben: But how many things can you collapse to zero? I think that's the question. With Microsoft, they were able to collapse their marginal cost to zero, but they still had distribution costs, and then Google collapsed distribution costs to zero with the Internet. What's a big cost that a company has now? Maybe AI will collapse. You no longer need 50,000 employees, you can have five employees. Maybe it can collapse that to zero.You need something of that scale, which is, where does a company spend most of its money that suddenly it can spend no money on? I suppose actually it is on the human capital. You just look at big successful companies and look at what they spend money on. Those are the candidates.David: Good point. Still unlikely we'll ever find another Microsoft opportunity.Ben: Yup. Other fun things on the IPO, do you know who IPO'd the day before Microsoft did?David: No.Ben: Oracle. Oracle had a nice pop, which actually helped Microsoft price a little bit higher in their IPO. That is another episode we have to do.Another thing adds yet another layer to the insanity of everything that we've been talking about of why they were able to build such a successful company on such little capital, I don't think there has ever been a tailwind in history like the one that Microsoft had with the secular growth of the personal computer wave. The only thing I can think of that is comparable is Amazon with the growth of the Internet, powering their early growth.Here's the stat. From 1975 to 1986, 11 years prior to their IPO, so founding to IPO, PCs grew at a compound annual growth rate of 98%. It grew from 4000 units per year to 9 million units per year shipped. You can almost not mess up when you have a tailwind that.David: Especially when you are the linchpin player.Ben: They managed to make themselves the point of integration for the whole industry. Oftentimes, I find myself when we're looking at these companies that are among the most successful in the world or like Microsoft, the most successful in the world, it's basically a multidimensional multiplication problem.They had this unbelievable one in a zillion thing going for them, which you can multiply by this other one in a zillion multi thing. It's the zero marginal cost, zero distribution cost, unbelievable secular growth of the PC, Moore's law happening. They're the single choke point for the whole industry. It's just crazy how many things you multiply together, and of course it should end up in a number over three trillion.David: Yup. I'll jump in with a playbook theme that we referenced a little bit in the episode, but we really got a highlight here. Bill, Steve, Paul, and everybody at Microsoft, were incredibly talented, incredibly smart. They saw the future in a way nobody else did, but they also were willing to hedge their bets.It's not like they just got everything right. They were going to get things wrong with OS/2, but they hedged the bets with Windows. I think that is such a key lesson of when you're in a really dynamic market like this, in our ecosystem right now in tech, venture capital, startups, whatnot, people put so much value on conviction. I have conviction. This is what the future is going to be like. I think the Microsoft story is the opposite of that. They had conviction that software was going to be big.Ben: And personal computers. Creating software for desktop computers was a really good idea, and they wanted to be the best at it.David: Yeah, but the exact path of how that was going to play out, they had very little conviction and were willing to be very flexible.Ben: You're right. It's both the hedging, but also then the ability to read the world and quickly, entirely change your strategy if you need to, and having your hedge be far enough along that you can jump quickly to it and shift your whole organization to get on board with it. That's a hard leadership thing to do.David: Totally. I can't wait in the next episode to talk about the Internet tidal wave memo. That's related to your playbook theme too. You can't really do that if you don't own 49% of the company, if it's not your company.Ben: Which I think you're seeing play out with most CEOs today. There's a big difference between a founder-CEO and the stuff that they can do. Zuckerberg with the metaverse or Jensen with betting the whole company and going all in again on AI versus Tim Cook or Sundar Pichai, certainly a very different type of CEO. Satya is interesting. Despite the fact that he doesn't own half the company, he's got a lot of founder-like control, which I think is pretty interesting.David: All right, don't get ahead of ourselves.Ben: Moving along. Other playbook themes, a big one that jumps out to me is that new generations of technologies enable market dislocations. Unless you are in a transformational moment in terms of a new technology came out that enables something that wasn't possible before that's going to rearrange the whole value chain and open up new markets, it's pretty hard to go challenge an incumbent. No one was going to challenge IBM really until the microcomputer, even the minicomputer people. Did DEC really challenge IBM? Not really. It never made a dent.David: It wasn't a full platform shift in the same way.Ben: And there are these little blips of it. The GUI I think meaningfully reshuffled the DECs. Those are the moments where you can have meaningful new entrants. Otherwise, you have to bide your time and just build your hedges and see.Related, even if you are the incumbent being disrupted, it is possible to have a very, very large and durable revenue stream that can go on for a very long time. What I'm referring to in this particular example is despite all of the dethroning that we just talked about, Microsoft would not eclipse IBM in revenue. You mentioned market cap, David, but in revenue until the year 2015. Isn't that nuts?David: I intentionally didn't look up revenue because it made the story muddier, but wow, there you go.Ben: I think that's the point. Microsoft's perception by the market, I'm sure they were growing faster, I'm sure they had better gross margins. I'm sure there was a better story there, so there's a multiple that comes out of the story. I'm sure there are lots of good reasons why Microsoft became more valuable than IBM very early, but IBM's revenue did not peak until 2012. What?Long after public perception moves on, customers still get value from something created by incumbents for a very long time. I think that's something we often forget about in the buzzy Twitterverse of like, oh that thing's over. It might still grow for another 20 years before it's over.David: That also just speaks to the nature of the enterprise business, too.Ben: That's a good point.David: IBM was the enterprise business. Today, Microsoft is the enterprise business.Ben: That's true. Peloton revenue can dry up a lot faster than contracts for mainframes. What do you got?David: A playbook theme that I want to highlight that really, really came out in our conversations is Microsoft was not just a talent magnet, the talent magnet during the PC era. If you were an ambitious young person, this is where you wanted to be.It was on every dimension. If you were an ambitious young technical person, that's where you wanted to be. If you were an ambitious young salesperson, if you're an ambitious young marketing person, that's where you wanted to be.They just had this culture there, which is so funny. We'll talk in the next episode of how that culture really fell apart for a while there. I asked a lot of these early people that we talked to, what was it being there? You guys worked yourselves half to death. Were you mad about that? Did you resent it? Were you just making Bill rich? They're all like, no. Yeah, we neglected every other part of our life, but that was the good old days. This was the magic, we were making it happen.Ben: That totally comes through. I asked Brad, why did Windows 95 work? There's lots of structural reasons, but he said, we basically did two things. (1) We laid out principles for product and then pushed responsibility down. Developers were often their own PMs. There's this idea of once you got the principles, we don't need to write a zillion specs, design something three times, and pass it through three functions. You know the principles, make great software that follows the principles. (2) He said that everyone felt personally responsible for the product, and it really showed.David: Anybody you talked to from this era of Microsoft, this was their life's work. No doubt about it.Ben: Something we touched on a little bit is the benefit of scaling with OEMs. This was the contrast against Apple, where I said Apple was always going to be a niche player by the way that they designed, built, and packaged everything themselves. Apple is in many ways like the AmEx, where Microsoft is the Visa.On our Visa episode, it just became so clear that Visa could quickly take over the world at MasterCard by being an open network, where they didn't have to do all the work to scale themselves. They could distribute to a bank, partner with a bank, and then boom, each of the banks that was on their network could independently scale at their own rate, which created obviously compounding effects for how fast Visa and MasterCard could scale. The same can be said of Windows.David: Totally, the OEMs. Yeah.Ben: I think the Microsoft OEM team for Windows was 20 people or something. Before the enterprise, in this era that we're talking about, the group of people responsible for go-to market for Windows was really small. They sold some retail, but the team was just about, hey, make sure HP and...David: Compaq, Dell, and Gateway.Ben: Exactly. That was their go-to market, and it makes your scaling unbelievably efficient.David: Dude, you're getting a Dell.Ben: Dude, you are getting a Dell. Similarly, I think the fact that they went international early was this very powerful constraint. It meant that every time they shipped software, they had to make it globally ready quickly. That meant that if there was any network effects to your software, anything becoming a standard, Microsoft was just way better positioned to become the standard than anyone else was.On top of there being network effects, there's also scale economies. A word processor is a word processor. The extent that you have customers in every country who can buy your one piece of software, you can amortize the development costs over a huge user base so much more quickly.David: 100%.Ben: The fact that they forced themselves to be international early meant that every product after that also had to figure out how to do all the localization, training, and all of that to get all those effects too.David: No matter how much time, money, and resources you have to spend to localize Microsoft word into kanji, it's a lot less time and resources and money than developing Microsoft word.Ben: Exactly. They just realized that so early. They also realized that most people who were doing some localization would do a shoddy job. They would think about it as lesser than the US market. They just did a good job at localization. They just cared. They thought of it as this is a strategic pillar that in every country, everyone experiences our software to the same quality because it's our brand everywhere. I don't know. I just think that is not how the rest of the industry thought about it.David: Definitely not.Ben: On top of all of this, the way that they executed it through subsidiaries was pretty genius. Redmond did not control international. They spun up country managers and subsidiaries in each of these countries in a ton of countries.While Redmond did the product development and then did the engineering work to do localization to all the strings files and everything for those countries, the actual marketing messaging, the sales strategy, and the sales structure, happened in country that was owned by a person who lived there so they actually could think through, what is the best way for people to receive this software here?Again, that's just going to yield way better results than if you're sitting there armchair quarterbacking at Redmond thinking about how a person in Chile is going to receive your marketing message.One other that I have is this one that we didn't really talk about, but Microsoft famously was not first to market with basically any of their applications. They aren't even really today in most cases. You think about the strategy that they had early on spreadsheets, word processing, all these were copycats at their outset.Sometimes they would do an acquisition, but most of the time they just look at a product and say, huh, our software should do the same thing, and they would copy it. They had no shame in doing that. They had their eyes everywhere looking for good ideas, they had reverence for the good ones, and then they would just incorporate them.On top of that, they wanted to make the software very easy to switch to. A lot of the keyboard shortcuts in Excel to this day are there because they were originally the Lotus 1-2-3 shortcuts. They wanted people to have the same muscle memory that just worked.Fundamentally, what this does for you as a business is it just leads to better risk adjusted returns. You already know what's going to work before you ship it. You don't really take market risk. You're not going to be the first to the market with early adopters, but most of the time, you actually don't need to be to win.I think Microsoft own that idea. Most of the time people are sheepish about it. Steve Jobs famously said, Microsoft has no taste. I think that's another way to put it that it's copycatting.David: I do agree with the premise, with all of this. I think doing this episode though has made me think there's a little more nuance to it. Yes. In broad strokes, you can say that's what Microsoft strategy was with applications over the years, but the Microsoft versions never actually won until there was a platform shift that they could take advantage of to beat the incumbent.Microsoft wasn't going to beat Lotus 1-2-3 until the graphical paradigm came along, and then Excel being graphical was just obviously so much better. They tried with Multiplan, they failed. Multiplan was fine, but 1-2-3 was the winner.The nuance to me is yes, but it's more like with the resources of Microsoft and the timeframe that Microsoft can afford to have, they can afford to start building the application, start building the product, getting into market, start learning, be positioned that then when the paradigm shift comes, leap ahead.Ben: That's a good point. It's also different. The Lotus 1-2-3–Multiplan thing, in that era, Microsoft just didn't have great distribution yet. Lotus 1-2-3 just got pretty far ahead of them, and Microsoft had no way to catch up. A few years after that, that would basically never be true again.David: That could be true too.Ben: I will say, you touched on something that's an interesting corollary to this. Their first versions of software famously are not good. You look at Windows 1.0 and 2.0. They know that it's part of the strategy, and they were world class at learning from customers and integrating customer feedback into subsequent versions.There's always this saying of Microsoft doesn't have a very good first or second version, but the third version of something is typically pretty good. I think that fact pattern definitely follows.David: I'm curious your thoughts on this. I'm so surprised. One thing that you have not brought up yet on this episode is you were a PM at Microsoft for several years.Ben: I was, but it was such a different era in that 2012–2014 era. I guess 2011 is when I started as an intern. I'll have a lot of thoughts on it next episode.David: Okay, great. I've got one more playbook theme before we move on to power. Microsoft figured out software before anybody else, and they figured out so many aspects of what it means to be a software business before anybody else, but they figured out that software is never done.I do think a lot of their competitors, we didn't obviously didn't study Lotus to the same degree that we studied Microsoft here, we didn't study WordPerfect, et cetera, but I think there was a mindset that a lot of other folks are like, you ship software, and then the software was done.That was not the culture at Microsoft. This is related to what you were just saying. Shipping software is the beginning. You are always working on that software. You're working on next versions and stuff, but even before the next version, the work of software is never done.Ben: Of course, if you own the hardware, you definitely think of it more of like, well, we ship them, the big cabinet of things, we install it, and we fix it if it's broken, but we've sold them hardware. The software is required to run it, but the thing we sold them is the hardware. If you're a pure software company, you think about the world differently.You're like, well, I can always ship you another CD, another floppy disk, over the Internet. It's obviously very different. But because there weren't really software companies before them, of course people didn't come from that mindset.David: I think you still see the legacy of this right to this day in Apple versus Microsoft. Apple still is on a yearly software release cadence, which is ridiculous. Whereas Microsoft is on the cloud, it's all constant. It's all constantly shipping. Look at AI, look at OpenAI. The software is never done so deeply in the software business model.Ben: That's true.David: All right, should we move on to power?Ben: Yes. Listeners who are new to the show, we do this section based on Hamilton Helmer's seven powers framework. The question is, what is it that enables a business to achieve persistent differential returns, or to put in another way, to be more profitable than your closest competitor and do so sustainably?The seven are counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs, network economies, process power, branding, and cornered resource. David, I am pretty sure I could make a case somewhere between 1975 and 1995 at Microsoft for all seven of these.David: Totally.Ben: It's one of the most defensible businesses they built in history, so of course they would have all seven of the powers.David: All right, let's run through each of them and do a quick 45 seconds on each.Ben: Great. Counter positioning. I think the biggest example of this comes through where Microsoft is basically willing to jump on the microcomputer revolution before the incumbents were. IBM did not want microcomputers to happen. When they started to happen, IBM tried to figure out how to slow it down and reintegrate it into their old business model.Microsoft basically had no baggage. This is classic innovator’s dilemma stuff. They could say, well, we don't need to make any money on hardware. We don't need to even make hardware. We are free to become the whole point of integration for the entire ecosystem just by shipping bits. And that is crazy.David: Actually, related to that—I can't believe we haven't talked about this in the episode until now—Microsoft could enable other companies to be successful. You talk to Microsoft people, they always talk about themselves as a platform, like we're a platform. Other companies grow on the back of Microsoft. That was not true for IBM. Totally not true.Microsoft could make Compaq successful. Microsoft could make Lotus successful. Microsoft could make Intuit successful. Microsoft could make Netscape successful.Ben: We keep talking about Microsoft as the point of integration, choke point, dependency, or standard for the whole ecosystem. Given that, it is quite remarkable how much value they created on top of the platform versus just captured for themselves. There's that famous Bill Gates line, you want your ecosystem around you to be generating more revenue than you are taking for yourself. They did a ton of that. It's the OEMs, and it's the application developers.David: That's major counter positioning. Okay, that's one.Ben: Scale economies.David: That's everything we just talked about in Playbook.Ben: It's unbelievable. When Microsoft has an install base of 100 million people using Excel—in this episode, let's just say 10 million people who are using Excel—and suddenly some up and coming spreadsheet comes out with a cool feature like auto sum, fill down, draw borders around the cells, or whatever, suddenly, Microsoft does a tiny bit of dev work. They can reap tons and tons and tons of value for doing that that the tiny company cannot do.David: Yup, great.Ben: Fixed amount of dev work amortized across a large customer base.David: I don't think we need to say any more on this. The whole episode's about scale economies.Ben: Yes. Switching costs. The funny thing about monopoly is there's nothing to switch to.David: That's a good one. This one's pretty related to network economies for me with this one of, okay, sure, you can switch to another operating system. Good luck getting other applications that you know and love to run on that.Ben: Yeah, that's the answer.David: Speaking of network economies, developers, applications, OEMs.Ben: There's not a classic network, Facebook, or AT&T style network here, in terms of one user can contact every other user, but more users being on Windows incentivizes more developers to make great applications for Windows, which enables Microsoft to sell more copies to more users, et cetera.David: Although, actually, I think once they start getting into the enterprise workplaces in general, organizations in general, there is the user network effect, like I want this Microsoft Word document that I just worked on for you to be able to open it and use it too.Ben: You're right. I didn't even think about that. The document formats are a huge network effect thing, even before the Internet. Even before organizations were networked and computers were networked outside of an organization, file formats. You're right, there are huge network economies to file formats.David: Yeah, and it's inter-organizational too. If I'm a law firm, I want my clients to be able to open my Word docs.Ben: Right.David: Okay, next.Ben: Process power. This might be the weakest.David: As it so often is.Ben: It's elusive. This is a little bit later in history, but I did always think it was absolutely incredible when I was at Microsoft, and we would ship a version of Office every three years. I worked on Office 15. The entire 6000 person organization had a process in place, where we could release to manufacturing (RTM) on a date that we planned three years in advance and actually hit it.The process of the ads cuts meetings, the zero bug bounce, the testing schedule, and the triage when you had things that people wanted to introduce late in the schedule. It was a remarkable product, especially with all these teams that needed all their code to interoperate.I worked on a shared experiences team that would check things and that would be a dependency. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, all of them took on the shared code. We knew our ship date three years in advance and would hit it. It's crazy.David: Totally. This exists. Especially by the time you get to the Windows 95 era at the end of this episode, it's like RenTech. The amount of stuff and process within Microsoft, the device drivers, the middleware, the programming languages, the dev tools, the machine there to make all this computing work, there was a miracle that this stuff worked. You couldn't just recreate that.Ben: It's funny. The process power, I would say, is stronger in Office than Windows. Now my colors are showing. Windows always notoriously miss their ship dates. I'm actually less sure that process power existed in that early days. I think they were a bunch of smart people, but I'm not sure that they had a unique way of creating software.David: I think that got built over time.Ben: Agree.David: Okay, branding, for sure.Ben: For sure.David: Don't get fired for buying Microsoft.Ben: That's true. Windows 95 built a consumer brand. The idea of a consumer brand of operating systems was there was Apple, but they were tiny, and that was more around the hardware.David: It's both fronts. It's their brand in the enterprise that is an amazing story that they built. They were branding consumer. The easiest to point to instantiation is the Rolling Stones and Jay Leno, but they had a software brand. Nobody had that.Ben: But branding is probably the thing that they rely on the least interestingly enough. There are other structural reasons that they're entrenched, where even if Microsoft had a crappy brand in this era, they probably still would have won. The magic of getting the whole deal with the IBM PC and then getting to sell licenses to all the other OEMs.David: That brings us to the last one, which I think is a super strong one at least in this era, cornered resource. DOS, full stop.Ben: Yup. It didn't start as a cornered resource, but as soon as IBM started shipping it on the IBM PCs, it was over. I'll say it again, IBM's distribution created demand for DOS, and then Microsoft just got to capture value from everyone else who wanted it.All right, we would do bear and bull, listeners, but we know what happened after this. The bull case is that the party continues, and Microsoft continues shipping amazing operating systems after amazing operating systems. That stays the important thing in the world. The bear case is something else becomes an important thing in the world. Just having this super locked-in operating system is not actually the way to bet your whole company for the future.David: The dramatic tension for you all to come back for our next episode on Microsoft here is not because you want to find out what happens.Ben: That's true.David: Okay, take away, splinter. We've spent the last probably six weeks deep in this. We've talked to everybody. What are you thinking about in the middle of the night?Ben: The IBM deal. I can't unsee it. Microsoft figured out a way to take someone else's dominance and wholesale transfer that into their dominance for the next generation. The fact that IBM called the Project Chess is so deeply ironic because Bill Gates was playing chess and they played checkers.David: Maybe Bill was playing 3D chess. This is the thing about it, though. We got to give IBM so much credit for Project Chess and the PC, that they even did what they did was huge, that a big entrenched corporation that could ship a skunkworks project in a year, revolutionized the industry. They just didn't end up capturing any value out of it.Ben: If I could make a less cheeky comment on it, I would say it's that a new technology generation, when something becomes possible and opens up a new market, it enables a shift in the point of integration and a value chain.The old value chain of IBM, if you shipped the mainframe, you had all the power. But in this new world of PCs, if you controlled the operating system that all the users were familiar with and all the developers wanted to target, you had all the power. I think that is not necessarily obvious unless you went through it and have the hindsight of history to be able to articulate it.David: I think you might be right. I think this might be the single best business deal negotiation of all time.Ben: It arguably created $3 trillion of value.David: No, a lot more than that because this is the point about Microsoft being a platform. Microsoft is worth $3 trillion, but how much value has been created on top of Microsoft? No matter what you think, good, bad, or ugly of Microsoft, you can't deny that.Ben: Absolutely.David: At least twice as much, probably much, much more.Ben: You watch every early interview with Bill, and you read a lot of his writing, he's a great writer. It's awesome that so many of his memos leaked whether intentionally or unintentionally over time.David: So many of his memos were issued for publication.Ben: He really did view himself as a steward of the software ecosystem, and had this steadfast belief that software was magic and was going to change the world. Over the next 20 years, from 1975 to 1995, software did change the world, and Microsoft enabled it to happen.Again, good, bad, or ugly, whatever you think of the company, they were sincere. I think the ugly part is, a lot of people want to hate on the value capture, because god did they capture value, but they were sincere in their desire and ability to create too.David: Totally. That's super related to my takeaway here. The moment for me in the research and then when we're telling the story along the way is when they start to believe in themselves that they don't need IBM. Just the audacity, and I mean that in a pure good way of these kids. These kids changed the world. That's so trite to say.My book we read my daughter at bedtime and somebody gave us, it's like the most Silicon Valley trophy thing ever. It's like, what do you do with an idea? The punchline at the end of it is you change the world. It's become such a trope, but these kids in the 70s did it. They believed in themselves in the beginning and then more and more and more over time.There's just this moment that I think, where they started to really, truly believe that they were going to change the world. Again, good, bad and ugly come out of that. Mostly good, I think, but just the level of ambition and audacity of these people is staggering.Ben: Is that your splinter in your mind?David: That's my splinter, yeah.Ben: Listeners who are new to the show, we've been iterating on how we end episodes. We decided on this recently of, how should we land the plane? It's to talk about the thing that we can't stop thinking about.David: This company's 49 years old, and it's still the most valuable company in the world.Ben: Crazy. All right, David, I have some trivia for you.David: I love it. Trivia before carve outs.Ben: Do you know where Dave Marquardt from TVI first encountered Bill Gates?David: No, I just assumed it was through Steve.Ben: Dave had watched Bill present many years earlier at none other than the Homebrew Computer Club at Stanford, the very place that is part of the Apple lore with Jobs and Woz showing off the early Apple computer. Apparently, Bill also went and made a presentation there and would hang out there, and that is where Dave first came across him.David: Amazing. When we were talking about the letter that Bill writes to the hobbyist community decrying piracy and software, he's basically writing it to the Homebrew Computer Club. He believed that those were the people who were ripping off his software.Ben: It's amazing. All right, carveouts?David: All right, carveouts. For new listeners, at the end of every episode, Ben and I just chat about one or two things that we've been enjoying personally lately that usually have nothing to do with the episode.In my case, I have two. The first one has a lot to do with the episode. I have discovered/rediscovered the LGR YouTube channel. Are you into this Ben?Ben: No.David: Clint and LGR, and it stands for Lazy Game Reviews, which I think is how it started, but then it became so much more, and now it's just LGR. Clint is this awesome dude, and I think he lives in North Carolina. He is dedicated to basking in the glory, restoring, reliving, and preserving computer history, hardware and software from this era. The YouTube channel is all unboxing a Compaq PC from 1992 or restoring a Windows 3.1 machine.Ben: That's awesome.David: It's so good. He's got the best, most soothing voice in the world. He just seems like such a nice dude. He's dedicated to preserving the era of computing that we are talking about on this episode. It's so fun.Ben: That's cool. It's really hard because all hardware fails eventually. At some point, there will be zero computers out there that can run Windows 3.1 that will boot. The only way to experience any of these things is through an emulator. I don't know. To be able to capture high-res footage and stuff of those machines while they still work, it's cool.David: Yup, super cool. My other carve out is Andre 3000 from Outkast. Do you know what Andre 3000 is up to these days?Ben: Not at all. No.David: Oh, my God. Okay. GQ just did a big interview with Andre 3000 because he just released a new album. This is not what you think. Andre, a lot of people say, consensus top five rappers of all time. Big Boi, his counterpart in Outkast, also great too, but they basically went out on top.They did Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which was their double album. I think it came out 2004 maybe. I was a freshman in college.Ben: Hey Ya was on that, right?David: Hey Ya, yeah, everything was on that. They did one more album, and then they stopped. Andre would be featured on some other rappers tracks over the years, but didn't put out another album for close to 20 years. He just put out an album, and he just did this big video interview with GQ.The album is a flute album. He got really into woodwind instruments. This has been his life. He reveals in the interview that he has put out other songs and other albums over the years under pseudonyms. This interview is so great. It's so unexpected because the interviewer keeps asking, you're Andre 3000, why'd you stop rapping? I don't have anything to say. Am I going to rap about getting a colonoscopy? This is where my life is right now. I never wanted to put out any work that wasn't both authentic and great. I didn't have anything to say anymore.Ben: Yup, I love that. If you ever heard the phrase, go out when the top row at the back of the auditorium is empty?David: Yeah, and that's what they did. Idlewild which was the album that came out after Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, was great, but it wasn't that, and yet that's exactly what he did.Ben: I think it's a Seinfeld quote. I might misattribute it. Drop a note in the Slack if I did, but I think it's a Seinfeld quote. \"You let one row be empty, but you don't want to wait too long.\"David: Yeah, it's the same thing as what Seinfeld did.Ben: Fascinating.David: Super fun. We'll link to it in the show notes.Ben: All right. I have three and they're all different. We've had a tradition on the recent episodes of doing multiple carveouts, and all of them are different genres. My product that I've really been loving, my physical product is the Meta Ray-Bans.David: Yes. I was talking with the team at Meta about them. They're doing great.Ben: I bet. It's a pretty delightful product. I bought them because I was in Hawaii and with my four month old son. We were in the pool and stuff. My iPhone's waterproof, but I want a different angle, and I don't necessarily want to be holding my phone. It's very cool to be able to take pictures and record video of what I actually see to be able to relive that moment.I did a bunch of photos and video. We were on vacation that way, and then I discovered a thing that they're actually just awesome for. I think even better than AirPods is phone calls. The speakers are great. I wouldn't say necessarily they're the best for listening to music. The bass is obviously not as good as headphone bass. They project the sound down toward your ears. Unless you're standing really close to me, you can't really hear, or unless I have the volume all the way up.The microphones are great too. I was on a long walk on the beach with the wind whipping by on a call with my mom. I was like, does this sound really bad and distorted to you? She's like, not at all. I was really impressed and we'll definitely be using them for more calls. I think that style of headphone over the ear, there are many things that it's not good for.When you're on an airplane or something, you want to plug your ears, or if you're in a super loud environment. But unless you're in one of those environments, it's a nice break for your ears versus having AirPods jammed in. It's a great call experience. So they're great.The battery's great. It's a four-hour battery, so it's a low key, more subtle, augmented reality experience. There's no heads up display. You don't see anything, but when you get a text message, it'll read it to you.David: There's more than just the camera system.Ben: Totally. It basically is you have AirPods in, but you don't actually have AirPods in, and you have a pretty good photo video camera on your face.David: Does it have an indication when you're taking photo or recording video?Ben: Yes. It's not super bright. I'm not sure everybody really knows when you are, but if you know what to look for, you know if it's on or off.David: Cool.Ben: I've been loving it. I think it's a great product. I intend to wear them a lot this summer.My second one is a thank you to a very, very good designer, Julia Rundberg, who worked with David and I on a recent project for some design work, some of which is actually featured as we speak on Apple podcasts. She did a bunch of other stuff with us, too, and she's really excellent.If you're looking for someone who's good at visual identity, branding, slide decks, websites, I've worked with her on a few projects before and she's just awesome, so I wanted to recommend her.My third is this community spotlight to go all the way back to nine years ago Acquired. It was a listener who runs a company called Summer Health reached out and said, I heard you say that you have a baby. I've got this great company that is for new parents, and here's some info on it. I am now a paying member. It is an on-demand texting relationship with a pediatrician.David: Wow. This is crack for new parents.Ben: It is crack for parents. It's crazy. You can hook up multiple phones, so my wife and I both have a direct line to like, something weird is going on, will you help me through it? We had a 2:00 AM wake up the other night. Everything ended up being fine, but as I'm sure any other new parents can relate to, you really want to make sure in the middle of the night, if you're not sure if everything's fine, you would like to figure out the right steps to make sure everything's fine. Having a virtual doctor on demand is totally amazing. Summer Health, if you are a new parent, we've been loving it.David: Amazing. I'm going to have to subscribe. We've referred to this before. I think this will probably be the last episode that comes out while I'm still the parent of just one child. Number two coming soon. If it may take a little longer than usual for the next Microsoft episode to come out, our next six-hour opus on Microsoft, don't get too mad, that is the reason why.Ben: We have a lot of thank yous on this one, as you can imagine. People were really generous with their time, pointing us to different resources, explaining their recollection of history as it happened. Being in Seattle, active in the venture community here, both through PSL and David, you're in my shared history at Madrona, me working at Microsoft, a lot of good opportunities to learn what really happened from folks.A huge thank you to Mike Slade who spent the time with me. Mike spent two different stints at Microsoft and then at NeXT, and Apple in between.David: Yeah, he worked for Steve at NeXT, right?Ben: Yup. One of the few people in the world who both spent a ton of time with Steve, Bill, and worked closely with both of them. It's so great to get his perspective, especially about the early days of Office and the applications group. Very helpful. Similarly, Pete Higgins worked closely with Mike. Pete, I think, ran Excel for a long time and oversaw a lot of the different stuff in the applications group, and I believe also ran Office.It's funny how many different people picked up the mantle over time as these things traded around groups. But frankly, I think that's a huge part of the Microsoft story. The company very quickly adapted and changed its structure depending on the current needs of technology, competitors, and et cetera.Huge thanks to Tren Griffin, who is actually a lifelong Seattleite and close friend to the whole Gates family. Bill Gates Sr. was his mentor. I'm sure you've seen Tren's prolific tweets online about Microsoft history. Actually, Tren I think currently works at Microsoft in a strategy role. Thanks Tren for your help as well. David, I know you've got a bunch.David: Yes. Also, speaking of former Microsoft folks who are very active and prolific on Twitter, we talked to Steven Sinofsky who had lots and lots of great perspective, and we can't wait to share more of it on the next episode.Ben: I read 20 of Steven's Hardcore Software posts. When David and I were dividing up what belongs in what episode, I realized 19 of them belong in next episode. Steven, thank you for your early prep work for part two.David: So much fun internet stuff to talk with that Steven was right there for. I spoke with other people who ran windows, Terry Myerson who's a great friend and a supporter of the show. Terry ran Windows for quite a long time, right?Ben: Yeah. When I was there, Terry was EVP over Windows and Windows Phone.David: Terry was very generous. He was actually the first person that clued us into just how key Steve's role was in building the enterprise for Microsoft.Ben: And how different the go to market motions were for Windows and Office. I think Terry was the one that gave us the insight of Windows, especially in the early days. It was basically an OEM game, small group doing an OEM thing.David: There were 10 people selling that.Ben: And it's still I don't think a very big team even today.David: Speaking of strategy, Charles Fitzgerald, who's OG in Microsoft and a great platform strategy guy, prolific angel investor in Seattle now, it's fun chatting with him about the early days.Ben: Obviously, Brad Silverberg who we mentioned a bunch. It was very fun seeing after spending some time talking with Brad and texting a lot with him to see the end of the Windows 95 announcement after Bill and Jay Leno are done for Brad to come out and finish it off. It's fun. It's like watching a time machine, watching that thing is really cool.Soma Somasegar at Madrona is someone that David and I love crossing paths with in the Seattle entrepreneurship ecosystem.David: Soma's just such a legend at Microsoft and in the industry too. There's so many people who Soma made their careers, plucked them out of school, saw something in them that maybe they didn't even see in themselves, and then they went on to be big executives or venture capitalists at Microsoft or elsewhere.Ben: Lastly, huge thank you to Steve Ballmer. To be honest, it was a little bit surreal chatting and hearing about his experience over the whole thing. There's nobody including Bill Gates that bleeds Microsoft more than Steve Ballmer, and his just unabashed pure pride in what they built is infectious.David: Absolutely. It was so fun talking to Steve. He was so gracious with his time. It must have been just super special for you too. He was the CEO when you worked there.Ben: Totally. To be frank, I had a very opposite strategy in mind, but I was a new hire out of college, individual contributor PM. It was still the Windows company then, and Steve was championing the Windows strategy, and I was a guy working on Office for iPad.With that, our huge thank you to JP Morgan Payments, ServiceNow, and Pilot. You can click the link in the show notes to learn more about any of those great partners of Acquired.If you like this episode, I was thinking of ones to recommend. It would be pretty funny to go listen to the forethought acquisition, given all of this context. It's a short episode when David and I were not good at this yet, and we did our very best. It is from our early days, and it covers overlapping source material.David: Forethought was the company that made PowerPoint, Microsoft acquired, the first major acquisition for the company.Ben: If you are new to the show and looking for great recent episodes that we've done, I highly recommend the Visa one as discussed earlier in the Network of Networks idea, if you haven't heard that, or perhaps the Nintendo or NVIDIA episodes, all of which will be right up your alley if you liked this one.David: If you're not at all interested in technology or software, but have somehow managed to get through all these hours with us, give a listen to our LVMH and Hermes episodes. Even if you do love technology and software, which obviously you do if you're still here, there's so much to learn from that world.Ben: If you want to know every time an episode drops, get hints at the next episode topic, and get episode corrections and follow up, you can sign up at acquired.fm/email. Come discuss this episode with everyone else who's chatting about it at acquired.fm/slack.If you're looking for another episode, go check out our second show, ACQ2, where we will have actually some very awesome tech CEO guests coming out over the next month or so that are absolutely worth listening to, especially if you're interested in semiconductor and tech history. If you want some sweet Acquired merch, go to acquire.fm/store.With that, listeners, we'll see you next time.David: We'll see you next time.\n"

      "{'title': 'Microsoft Volume I: The Complete History and Strategy', 'about': 'Microsoft. After nearly a decade of Acquired episodes, we are finally ready to tackle the most valuable company ever created. The company that put a computer on every desk and in every home. The company that invented the software business model. The company that so thoroughly and completely dominated every conceivable competitor that the United States government intervened and kneecapped it… \\xa0yet it’s STILL the most valuable company in the world today. This episode tells the story of Microsoft in its heyday, the PC Era. We cover its rise from a teenage dream to the most powerful business and technology force in history — the 20-year period from 1975 to 1995 that took Bill and Paul from the Lakeside high school computer room to launching Windows 95 alongside Jay Leno and the Rolling Stones. From BASIC to DOS, Windows, Office, Intel, IBM, Xerox PARC, Apple, Steve Jobs, Steve Ballmer… it’s all here, and it’s all amazing. Tune in and enjoy… Microsoft.\\u200d', 'transcript': 'David: \\u200aWhat were you listening to before we hopped on to your walkout music?\\n\\nBen: The new Beyonce.\\n\\nDavid: The new Beyonce, I haven\\'t heard it yet.

I\\'m Ben Gilbert.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'m David Rosenthal.\\n\\nBen: And we are your hosts. We often remark that selling software is the best business model of all time. Today, finally, we tell the story of the company that created that business, Microsoft.\\n\\nDavid: Finally, we\\'re 10 years into Acquired. We\\'re finally doing it.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s been daunting. We wanted to do it for a while, but it takes some chutzpah to tackle Microsoft.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'m so fired up. We\\'re ready. It\\'s time.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, Microsoft today is sprawling and massive. It is the world\\'s most valuable company worth over $3 trillion. They have 49 years of history making software for consumers and enterprises, making hardware, gaming systems, gaming studios, Windows apps, iPad apps, Mac apps, operating systems, mobile operating systems, MP3 players, search engines, cloud computing, services on cloud computing, programming languages, development environments, and the list goes on. But it did not start out that way.\\n\\nToday, we will tell the story of the desktop software company. Before the enterprise, before IT, before the Internet, before being a trusted partner to governments around the free world, and really, before people even knew what to do with personal computers, this is the story of a bunch of ragtag geniuses in their 20s pushing what was possible.

If you want more from David and I, you should check out our second show, ACQ2, where we interview founders, investors, and experts often as a deeper dive into topics we cover on the main show. Before we dive in, we want to briefly thank our presenting sponsor, JP Morgan Payments.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, just how we say every company has a story, every company\\'s story is powered by payments. JP Morgan Payments is a part of so many journeys from seed to IPO and beyond.\\n\\nBen: With that, this show is not investment advice. David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss and likely all of you if you hold any index funds, and the show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. David, where on earth do we start the Microsoft story?\\n\\nDavid: We\\'re right down the middle on this one. We\\'re going to start in 1955 in Seattle, Washington with the birth of Bill Gates III or Trey as he\\'s known growing up. It\\'s so confusing because his dad is the second, but he goes by Senior, and Bill is Junior/III/Trey. Bill is born in 1955 as the second of three children to Bill and Mary Gates. Bill Gates Sr. (his father), is from Bremerton, the Navy town just across the sound from Seattle, where he grows up in a family that owns and runs a furniture store there, a long way from the software king of the world here.\\n\\nBill Gates Sr./II, after high school, he joins the Army during World War II, serves during World War II, and then he goes, I presume on the GI Bill to the University of Washington, where he\\'s the first member of his family to go to college. There he gets an undergrad and a law degree in four years, and then decides to stay in Seattle with his new family and become a practicing attorney.\\n\\nI say family because at the U-Dub, he meets and marries one Mary Maxwell. Mary, I don\\'t know how to put it other than that she is a force. Mary\\'s family had founded National City Bank, and her father was a senior executive at First Interstate Bank, which later became a big part of Wells Fargo. Mary, despite being the daughter of a successful business family in that day and age, was not cast aside like so many other daughters we\\'ve talked about on the show.\\n\\nBen: New York Times, Hermes, where it was passed to the son-in-law to continue to run the business. That was not the case with Mary Maxwell.\\n\\nDavid: No. After she graduates from the U-Dub, she becomes first the president of the Seattle Junior League. She starts joining nonprofit boards in Seattle as a very young woman. She joins the Seattle Symphony Board, the Chamber of Commerce, the Children\\'s Hospital, the King County United Way. She\\'s such a force on these boards that she starts getting asked by her fellow board members to join their company\\'s boards too. The corporate boards were so impressed with her.\\n\\nFirst, she joins the board of First Interstate Bank, the bank that her family\\'s a part of. Then she joins the board of Cairo Television in Seattle. She even ends up joining the Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Board.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s right, part of the AT&T breakup.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Eventually, she joins the Board of Regents of the University of Washington and the entire national United Way board. She never works full-time in a corporate setting, but it is not an overstatement at all to say that Mary Gates became one of the most powerful business people in the Pacific Northwest, period.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely, and Bill Gates Sr. was the prominent attorney in the region, so it\\'s quite the power couple.\\n\\nDavid: Ben, it\\'s like you\\'re reading my script here. Yes. We don\\'t want to give Bill Sr. the short shrift here either. He becomes a superstar lawyer, and he becomes a co-founding partner of the firm Preston, Gates, and Ellis, which today, I didn\\'t even realize until I dug in the research, that is K&L Gates today, one of the largest law firms in the world.\\n\\nAnother fun fact that you probably know about Bill Gates Sr., but we got to, this being Acquired, talk about. Do you know what corporate board he joined later in life?\\n\\nBen: I do not.\\n\\nDavid: Costco.\\n\\nBen: Of course, Bill Gates Sr., we should say too, basically galvanized the entrepreneurial community in Seattle. He started the tech alliance. He was a huge angel investor. He really did organize angel investors, people who want to put high risk capital to work into startups. His heart was there, obviously, through his law practice, long before Bill Gates III became the prodigy he became.\\n\\nDavid: Totally, and that\\'s the point we want to land here. For young Bill, Trey growing up here, he is growing up in a pretty unique household. He would later talk about being 9 or 10 years old. Most nights at dinner at his house, there would be a CEO, a senator, a governor, or somebody who\\'s just over for dinner, and Bill would sit there and absorb the business conversation. It\\'s like the Hermes family, the Dumas family that we talked about in that episode. This whole thing makes me think of Paul, the main character in the Dune movies in the book. He\\'s bred from birth to be this incredible business mind.\\n\\nBen: At age 13, with his best friend, who we will talk about very soon, he brought up the idea, I wonder what company I will be the CEO of when I grow up. What industry will I go after? What problems will I tackle? It wasn\\'t a question of if, but which.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. It just turned out that He would be the CEO and founder of the biggest company in the biggest industry ever to exist. The other thing that we got to say about Bill growing up, he is insanely competitive. He did not and does not like to lose at anything. That is putting it mildly, whether it\\'s sports, swimming, computers, school, or the classroom.\\n\\nThere\\'s a quote in one of the books we read from a childhood friend of his who says, \"Everything Bill did, he did competitively and never simply to relax.\" I think this used to be more than today. There\\'s this image of Bill Gates that he was a computer nerd, that he was this shy little skinny kid. The way he looks doesn\\'t help this, but that is not the case at all. This guy had a competitive fire in him, I\\'m sure he still does like none other.\\n\\nBen: Both things can be true. He was the number one math student in the State of Washington. He was a nerdy kid, a brilliant kid, and also fiercely competitive. His childhood friend and co-founder of Microsoft, Paul Allen, would say about him, “You could tell three things about Bill Gates pretty quickly. He was really smart, he was really competitive, and he wanted to show you how smart he was. And he was really, really persistent.”\\n\\nDavid: That sounds about right. Famously, speaking of Paul and where Bill and Paul meet, when Bill is in seventh grade, his parents enroll him at the Lakeside School, which now I think is internationally famous because of Bill. It is a super rigorous college prep school, middle school, and high school. Bill ends up writing the scheduling software for class scheduling that he puts himself in the classes with all the girls. Funny.\\n\\nThis Bill, 13 years old, seventh grade, Lakeside, this is when it starts. Obviously, Microsoft doesn\\'t start. But during that year, Bill is 13 years old, the Lakeside Mothers Club raises money to buy the school a teletype, connect it up, and rent computer time from a DEC PDP 10 that is located in downtown Seattle and owned by the branch office there of General Electric.\\n\\nProbably a bunch of you are like, I have no idea what any of those words mean, so we got to set some context. This is 1968, the Beatles, Vietnam, the Summer of Love. This is not the computer age.\\n\\nBen: 2001, A Space Odyssey had just come out.\\n\\nDavid: Nolan Bushnell has not founded Atari yet. Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore are only just leaving Fairchild Semiconductor to start Intel. Silicon Valley is still dominated by Lockheed. There is no such thing as a microprocessor.\\n\\nBen: The United States would land on the moon one year later.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. The way computing worked back then, it was basically still the ENIAC days. A computer meant two things. It either meant a massive room sized machine that had about the computing power of a calculator, or it meant a human. People talked about computers as humans. Have you ever seen the movie Hidden Figures about the black women who did the calculations?\\n\\nBen: Yes. Those women were the computers.\\n\\nDavid: They were called the computers, yes.\\n\\nBen: Because they would sit there and compute.\\n\\nDavid: This was a totally different era. The idea that a 13-year-old kid in this high school, this middle school would get access to share computer time, I can\\'t imagine there are many other secondary schools in the country that were doing this.\\n\\nBen: This is a very early place to make the point. Microsoft is the result of tremendous intelligence, brilliant strategy, fierce competition, and an unbelievable amount of luck. Bill Gates was born in 1955, the same year as Steve Jobs, to come into adulthood just as the personal computer wave is starting.\\n\\nThe fact that he was at a middle school and had this much privilege, where he could get access to a PDP-10 at this point in his life to help him understand how important computers would become, there are dozens of people in America who are as well-situated as Bill is, and that might be overly generous.\\n\\nDavid: He and Paul got a sneak peek into the future there at Lakeside. It\\'s funny, you said the personal computer era. We are so far away from the personal computer here. We got us at the stage. What is computing? I mentioned ENIAC and these room-sized things.\\n\\nComputers did not have screens. You didn\\'t have cursors, you didn\\'t have lights, you didn\\'t have pixels. Everything was done on a teletype that looked like typewriters, and they were wired up remotely either in the same facility or what Lakeside is doing. You could be remote. It\\'s almost the cloud today.\\n\\nBen: And it called over a phone line. That was the teletype.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Got wired over the phone line, hooked up to these mainframes. You typed commands into this teletype, and then the response came back over the phone line or over whatever cable from the mainframe. It got printed out on a spool of tape on the teletype. But this is power that normal 13-year-olds don\\'t come anywhere near accessing.\\n\\nWhat is the computing market at this time? It is pretty much—we\\'ll come back to the pretty much in a minute—100% dominated by IBM. IBM, Big Blue, Big Iron is what it was referred to, the products that they would produce, were the industry.\\n\\nBen: Ben Thompson has a fantastic quote on this. He has an article called, What is a Tech Company? And here\\'s his comment. \"Fifty years ago, what is a tech company was an easy question to answer. IBM was the tech company, and everybody else was IBM\\'s customers. That may be a slight exaggeration, but not by much. IBM built the hardware, at that time the System 360, They wrote the software, including the operating system and the application, and provided services including training, ongoing maintenance, and custom line of business software.”\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, System 360 was a line of solutions, I would say, offered by IBM. It consisted of the room-sized thing, the mainframe, the software, which was system 360, and the consulting and the implementation. You couldn\\'t just call up UPS and forklift one of these things into a company and expect it to work. No, you got to operate this thing too.\\n\\nBen: Totally, it\\'s like ASML machines. You don\\'t just ship them off to TSMC and say, good luck making semiconductors. It\\'s a full solution, full service thing. But an important thing that was also happening this year, 1968, was that IBM was undergoing some antitrust scrutiny over that huge bundle that I just told you about.\\n\\nDoesn\\'t it smell antitrust? They do everything from the hardware to the software to the operating system, the service, the support. They are the whole market. They\\'re starting to get concerned. Proactively, they unbundled hardware, software, and services. They started selling those separately for the first time, which was not a problem at first. What it did was it cracked the door for customers to say, oh, I can buy hardware from IBM and software from someone else? Other people were not exploiting this, but it was possible.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, interesting. It cracks the door for Microsoft 15–20 years later.\\n\\nBen: Yes, but this is where the seeds are sown of what is the exploitable opportunity when Bill Gates is ready to do something.\\n\\nDavid: Interesting. Back to the timing thing for Bill, Paul, and Microsoft. I mentioned when we were setting this up that there\\'s something else to talk about here. IBM was facing a disruptive force at this moment, I think, probably for the first time in its history, certainly in the computing era of IBM\\'s history, and that was the Digital Equipment Corporation or DEC. Noticed when we said earlier that Lakeside is renting computer time from the General Electric computer in downtown Seattle, I said it\\'s a deck PDP-10. It\\'s not an IBM product.\\n\\nWhat\\'s DEC? They\\'re the \"mini\" computer company. Mini meaning it was the size of a closet, not the size of a room. It\\'s all relative. DEC had been started by this guy, Ken Olson from MIT.\\n\\nWhat they did, he had this brilliant insight that would play out over and over and over again in technology that I\\'m not going to go compete with IBM head on, I\\'m not going to make any act. I\\'m not going to make mainframes.\\n\\nBut computing has advanced enough that there\\'s an opportunity to make something smaller, less powerful, more toy-like, and there\\'s enough demand out there that I think they can find some new markets for people who will buy those types of computers and it’s smaller businesses. But in particular, it\\'s branch offices of the big company.\\n\\nI am sure General Electric bought lots and lots and lots of IBM mainframes and products at their headquarters, but the GE field office in Seattle is not going to truck in a mainframe.\\n\\nBen: And in 1968, Seattle is a provincial little town. I\\'m standing here right now. It\\'s a major city and a huge economy in the United States. But at the time, a podunk, forgotten, sleepy, faraway place.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Microsoft would go a long way to changing that over time.\\n\\nBen: We should say this is the classic low-end disruption playbook. This is what Clayton Christensen was talking about. Going from mainframe to mini computers, I\\'m going to make something that\\'s worse for most things, but better for some new things that new customers and new markets are going to care a lot about. IBM\\'s going to look at it and go, that can\\'t do any of the things that are important to our customers. And that\\'s exactly why it works.\\n\\nDavid: Specifically, why are they not going to care about it? I don\\'t know exactly what an IBM mainframe system, System 360, 370, whatever cost. I\\'m imagining tens of millions of dollars all in total cost, maybe hundreds of millions of total dollars to run a system like that and buy it.\\n\\nThe first DEC machine, when it comes out, the PDP-1, a few years before this time, was priced at $120,000, so an order of magnitude, maybe two below a system that you would buy from IBM. Obviously still a long, long, long way from the personal computer. People are not buying these things for their houses, but GE will buy one for the field office in Seattle, or universities will buy them for research, for their students, for their professors.\\n\\nDEC creates a new market for computing. Bill, he\\'s so studied in business history, the founder, Ken Olson is Bill\\'s hero. He totally looks up to DEC and what DEC\\'s done. The DEC and minicomputer UI is still the same as the mainframe. You\\'re still using a teletype. There\\'s no innovation in terms of what computing is or how you use it. It\\'s just cheaper and more people have access to it.\\n\\nBack to Lakeside and the Mother\\'s Club raising money for this access here for the school, Bill, remember, he\\'s just started. He\\'s in seventh grade, and Lakeside is a middle school in a high school. The high school is actually in a separate building. The computer room that gets installed with the teletypes was over in the high school, but Bill doesn\\'t care. He gets exposed to it in a math class one day and he\\'s like, oh, I\\'m hooked.\\n\\nHe goes over. He\\'s hanging out with the high schoolers, teaches himself how to program, and pretty quickly he becomes known as one of the very best programmers there. He and three other kids form what they call themselves the Lakeside Programmers Group. One of his buddies who he forms it with is of course the high schooler or I think the 10th grader at the time, Paul Allen.\\n\\nBen: There is a fantastic photo, listeners, that we will tweet of Bill and Paul sitting in the computer room at Lakeside. Bill, I think he\\'s 13–14. He looks like he\\'s about eight. I think on the wall, there\\'s this almost printed out magazine thing that says the bug slayer that they\\'ve hung up over the wall. It\\'s amazing.\\n\\nDavid: These high school kids, they start the Lakeside Programmers Group. They call it the programmers group because they are programmers. This is another super important thing to learn. To use a computer at this time meant to be a programmer. There was no package software that you bought. The software that IBM was selling was the operating system to make the machines actually function, and it was the programming languages that you could then program on but you weren\\'t clicking around and using Excel or pulling up apps. Everybody who used a computer wrote their own software.\\n\\nBen: Right. There was not this multi-sided network of you\\'ve got developers making applications, and then you\\'ve got users of those applications. No, everybody who used a computer was a programmer.\\n\\nDavid: The goal of the Lakeside Programmers Group, remember Bill is this business prodigy, is to use their very valuable and very rare skills as programmers at this time to make money, do a business.\\n\\nIt turns out at the same time—the coincidences here are just crazy—there is a local startup coming out of the University of Washington called the Computer Center Corporation or C-Cubed. The business plan behind C-Cubed was that they were going to get a bunch of DECs, a bunch of PDP-8s, PDP-10s, PDP-11s, whatever, and they were going to be AWS. They were going to just be a computer time-sharing company.\\n\\nC-Cubed hires the Lakeside Programmers Group, these kids, to come in and find and document bugs in the system. They\\'re going to pay them directly in computer time. When they come into C-Cubed, they learn Fortran, they learn Lisp, they learn machine language for the PDPs. Back at Lakeside, they were just using BASIC, the programming language.\\n\\nBen: Which is reasonably high level in terms of how abstract it is. You\\'re not writing machine language. You don\\'t have to know how to address memory, registers, and all that. It reads English, it knows how to add numbers together. It\\'s not an elegant language, and it\\'s a very verbose language. But if you look at it with your eyes as a person who speaks English and knows basic math, you\\'re like, I understand what this program does. There\\'s a meaningful amount of translation done by a BASIC interpreter that takes you from the BASIC code you have to write to what is actually running on the machine.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, but BASIC, we don\\'t want to give the impression that it is just basic or just for kids.\\n\\nBen: No, it\\'s widely used.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s going to become hugely, hugely important. It is both the gateway programming language for everybody, but it\\'s a real programming language, and a lot of stuff is done in it.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s the Python of its day. I think the way Python is now where you joke that Python is so flexible, you can accidentally write a program by writing English, it can forgive a lot of mistakes, and it reads English, it\\'s a reasonable parallel to draw it way back when with BASIC where you say, look, you can understand it as a layman, but also it\\'s used in a broad set of business applications.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. When Bill, Paul, and their buddies come into C-Cubed, they\\'re now getting access to learn real hardcore systems programming languages, including machine code for the PDP-10. They\\'re becoming pretty prolific engineers here.\\n\\nBen: They\\'re handwriting assembly code.\\n\\nDavid: And they\\'re getting mentored. One of the executives at C-Cubed is a guy named Steve Russell. Did you find this, Ben? Do you know about this?\\n\\nBen: No.\\n\\nDavid: This is amazing. You\\'re going to die. Steve Russell was the guy who wrote Spacewar when he was at MIT on the first PDP, the PDP -1. He\\'s a computer science legend.\\n\\nBen: Nolan Bushnell told us about that.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Spacewar was the first video game, first computer game ever written. It was written as a fun side project by some MIT engineers in the early days of DEC, and then that became Nolan Bushnell\\'s inspiration for starting Atari and Pong. Steve Russell, that guy, he mentored Bill Gates.\\n\\nBen: Wow, and he was here at the University of Washington?\\n\\nDavid: He had come out to the University of Washington, and then left and was part of one of the execs starting this company.\\n\\nBen: C-Cubed, wow. That\\'s a mile from my house.\\n\\nDavid: Right? Crazy.\\n\\nBen: Wow.\\n\\nDavid: After a little while at C-Cubed, all of this real expertise that these kids are getting leads to another opportunity at another timeshare computing company based down in Portland. They ask the kids to write a real piece of software, to write a payroll billing program for all their clients that are using the timeshare system.\\n\\nBill now, who\\'s the de facto leader of this group, negotiates a deal with the help of his dad, Bill Gates Sr. prolific corporate attorney in Seattle. Rather than just being paid hourly for their time, they\\'re going to get a royalty on the revenue that their client makes off the software. I can\\'t believe it. These kids are teenagers. They\\'re figuring out the whole software business model here.\\n\\nThey end up making at least $10,000 from these royalties, which the average household income in the US at the time was below $10,000. These kids are rolling in money. The next year, Paul graduates from Lakeside and goes off to college at Washington State. He and Bill decide to team up on a new venture that they\\'re going to do together called Traf-O-Data.\\n\\nBen: They\\'ve identified a market opportunity, and that opportunity is reducing traffic.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. The business plan is that municipalities count cars that go through intersections, use that to make decisions about how they\\'re going to do city planning. Bill and Paul are like, we can take this new thing that\\'s coming out of Intel, a microprocessor, which is promising to be a full computer on one chip. We can use that. We can build a machine that is going to be a computer, and it\\'ll process and analyze that data, and then we can sell it to governments. Great, big market.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, are you sensing what\\'s happening here? Mainframe, mini computer, microprocessor. We have to keep using smaller and smaller words to represent the fact that the computer is getting smaller and smaller here.\\n\\nDavid: It wasn\\'t until we started doing research for this episode that I finally realized, oh, microcomputers, which is the original term for the personal computer for the PC. It was called microcomputers before PC caught on. They\\'re called microcomputers because they\\'re based on the microprocessor.\\n\\nBen: Yes, absolutely.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s not just that micro is smaller than mini.\\n\\nBen: It is funny that it stopped there. The computers that are sitting on all of our desks are microcomputers.\\n\\nDavid: Right. While they\\'re waiting for the AD08, this new first microprocessor from Intel, to come out, or at least for them to get access to it, they want to get a head start on programming their traffic data machine and programming this microprocessor. Paul\\'s like, I got this. I can find a way to make this happen.\\n\\nHe takes the PDP-10 at Washington State and he writes a whole emulator program to mimic the instruction set for the AD08 from the manual. They get a full emulator up and running, and they can code even without the microprocessor actually being there. It\\'s just NVIDIA. When Jensen was like, no, we got to build an emulator and simulate this, and then we\\'re going to ship it sight unseen, they\\'re doing the same thing.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s funny. In many ways, at this point in history, getting a manual was actually much more valuable than getting the processor itself because the processor would arrive. Unless there was documentation, you would have no idea how to interact with it to take advantage of its power.\\n\\nIf you had a manual, sure, you couldn\\'t actually test the stuff you wrote for it on the hardware. But if you wrote an emulator on a bigger, more powerful computer that could mimic the computer that you\\'re actually targeting, you could go years before actually ever running the software on the target device and just work off of what the manual says as long as the manual is correct and matches how it actually works.\\n\\nDavid: And this is going to become very important to Microsoft in just a second. Traffic data is not a huge success. I think I read a few places, they make about $20,000 in revenue from it. Again, great money for high school and college kids, but not world-changing stuff here. This is not what Bill aspires to for the company he\\'s going to start.\\n\\nBill and Paul are getting experience with the microprocessor. Bill actually has the idea for Microsoft when they\\'re working with it. He\\'s like, oh, this is a computer, why don\\'t I go off and write an interpreter for BASIC here, and we can sell the BASIC interpreter for the microprocessor and build a big business? The AD08 just wasn\\'t powerful enough yet to do that.\\n\\nBen: But spoiler alert, that totally becomes Microsoft. The seeds of Microsoft are selling language interpreters for new processors, new hardware, new computers that enable you to write familiar programming languages on that new hardware.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Bill and Paul are not the only ones having this insight here, too. Another Seattle guy named Gary Kildall who they had intersected with, who they knew from C-Cubed and the University of Washington, had the same idea here. We\\'re going to bring up Gary and his company, Digital Research, a little bit later.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, he cared a little bit less about programming languages and a little bit more about operating systems. That\\'s how they diverged for the few years here.\\n\\nDavid: Bill and Paul absolutely see the vision for what this can grow into and become. Bill has a great quote. \"Paul and I had talked about the microprocessor, and it was really his insight that because of semiconductor improvements, things would just keep getting better. I said to him, oh, exponential phenomena are pretty rare, pretty dramatic. Are you serious about this? Because this means, in effect, that we can think of computing as free. It was a gross exaggeration, but it was probably the easiest way to understand what it means to cut costs like that. And Paul was quite convinced of it.\"\\n\\nBen: Is this in the Smithsonian interview?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, so good.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s so good. This quote is incredible because basically, Paul Allen brings up Moore\\'s Law to Bill Gates; they don\\'t use that language there. But in 1971, that is what\\'s happening. For Paul, this is just an observation of hey, there\\'s an exponential thing happening here, it seems like it\\'s going to keep happening, it\\'s been happening.\\n\\nBill\\'s shaking and he\\'s like, what? Exponential phenomena don\\'t just happen. That\\'s incredibly, incredibly rare and immediately gets Bill\\'s wheels turning on. What does this mean for the world? If that\\'s actually true, we need to act and do something profoundly different than anyone\\'s ever done before because this enables new things that no one ever thought could be possible.\\n\\nDavid: This moment is the genesis of the vision for Microsoft. Even though Bill doesn\\'t say the words in this quote, the vision of a computer on every desk in every home, that\\'s the famous part that got left off later when the DOJ started sniffing around was running Microsoft software.\\n\\nBut that is the vision here, and it is crazy at the time. A computer on every desk and in every home, Bill sees that this is what this exponential phenomenon, what Moore\\'s law means, that that is going to happen. We\\'re still in the era of teletypes. Nobody else sees this.\\n\\nBen: And it\\'s also the reason why Microsoft is going to form into such a different type of company that\\'s ever come before it, why they can break all the rules, why they can sell just software, even though that\\'s never been a thing before, why their business model can be so much different than everyone else\\'s business model.\\n\\nIn preparing for this episode, we got to talk with Pete Higgins, who ran Excel and was an executive overseeing Office for a long time in the early days. He had this great quote to us, which was, \"Computer on every desk was wackadoo stuff. People laughed at it. It was absolutely wild. People thought, I don\\'t know, maybe 1 in 10 people in their finance group or something will have one at some point. This is the profoundness of an exponential decrease in price or increase in power of computing. It\\'s going to become universal.\"\\n\\nDavid: All that said, even Bill and Paul know the AD08. It\\'s not there yet. It\\'s not powerful enough to really be a general-purpose computer on a chip, but they know it\\'s coming. In the fall of 1973, Bill goes off to college at Harvard famously. It\\'s funny, at Harvard, like Jim Simons that we talked about at MIT on the RenTech episode. Bill thinks he\\'s going to be a world-class mathematician and set the world on fire.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s literally a quote from Paul Allen. Bill was the number one math student in the state of Washington. He gets there, and he does this theoretical math class, math 55 and gets a B. Paul says, when it came to higher mathematics, he might\\'ve been one in a hundred thousand or better, but there were people who were one in a million or one in 10 million. And some of them wound up at Harvard. Bill would never be the smartest guy in the room, and I think that hurt his motivation. He eventually switched his major to applied math.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. While Bill\\'s at Harvard, he\\'s also doing a bunch of the typical college kid stuff. He\\'s playing poker, he\\'s cutting classes, he\\'s making friends. One of the friends he makes there is a kid down the hall from him named Steve Ballmer. Everybody knows Ballmer. He\\'s everything that Bill is not. He\\'s super social, he\\'s super outgoing. He\\'s in a final club, which is a big thing in the social scene at Harvard.\\n\\nBen: He\\'s gregarious. Anyone who\\'s ever met Steve or seen a video of Steve, you are well aware that this man has a presence. But the thing that people don\\'t know about him is he is so unbelievably analytical. Steve is the guy that outscored Bill Gates on the Putnam exam.\\n\\nDavid: Which is the annual math competition for college students.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, Steve isn\\'t a programmer, but he is every bit the mathematician that Bill Gates is. That is one of these things where I think when people try to set it up as well, you\\'ve got the brilliant programmer genius and the marketing guy, it\\'s just like those are the roles they took. But I think when you\\'re getting a sense of who the original crew was at Microsoft, they were all brainiacs, and they were all wildly analytical.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. In the spring of 1974, Bill\\'s freshman year, Electronics Magazine publishes big news about a new Intel chip, the next generation, the next turn of the crank on Moore\\'s Law, the 8080. In Bill\\'s words here, all at once, we were looking at the heart of a real computer, and the price was under $200. We attacked the manual. I told Paul, DEC can\\'t sell any more PDP-8s now. It seemed obvious to us that if a tiny chip could get so much more powerful, the end of big unwieldy machines was coming.\\n\\nBen: Yup. This is really where Bill Gates commits to computers to be his life\\'s work. I think what\\'s often lost in the story is Bill, even though he was good at computers and spent tons of time programming computers, never fancied himself a computer guy until this moment in history. He went to Harvard because he felt, hey, if I ever want to be a lawyer or something else, they\\'ve got a lot of great programs there. This was the moment where I think it really clicked for him that I\\'m just in the middle of the right place at the right time with the right skill set, and this is my way of having the most impact on the world.\\n\\nDavid: They think, okay, what\\'s clearly going to happen here is all the big computer companies, IBM, DEC, the big Japanese computing companies, they see this. They\\'re going to get into this business, they\\'re going to make machines, and they\\'re going to make microcomputers. Surely, they will jump on this opportunity, right?\\n\\nBen: If it didn\\'t destroy their existing business model, sure they would.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Bill and Paul are sitting around waiting through 1974 and 1975 being like, hey, when are the 8080 computers going to come out? Where are they? It\\'s just crickets. Paul is so convinced that the revolution is coming that he actually drops out of Washington State, moves to Boston to be close to Bill so that they can be ready when it happens. That summer, they both get summer jobs at Honeywell as programmers. Paul stays on into the next school year when Bill goes back to school. He\\'s just waiting, waiting, waiting.\\n\\nIn December 1974, Paul is walking across Harvard Square, and he sees in a newsstand the January issue of Popular Electronics, on whose cover is the Altair 8800, the world\\'s first real honest-to-God commercially available for sale microcomputer. The legend has it that Paul grabs the magazine, runs over to Bill\\'s dorm, throws open the door, throws the magazine on the desk, and is like, it\\'s here. Bill\\'s just says, oh, my God, it\\'s happening without us. We need to get on this right now.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s so funny he thinks they\\'re already behind because clearly they\\'re not. History would show. I think Bill Gates even says, we might\\'ve actually started a year or two too early. The market actually hadn\\'t materialized yet. The funniest thing is, the starting gun went off, Bill and Paul ran, and everyone else is still standing around.\\n\\nDavid: This is it. This is the moment. The revolution is here. Microsoft is about to be founded. But first, this is a great time to thank our presenting partner this season, JP Morgan Payments.\\n\\nBen: Just like Bill\\'s vision of Microsoft to put a computer on every desk and in every home, JP Morgan has a vision for making payments real time, 24/7 everywhere and in every currency. JP Morgan has experienced a massive digital transformation, and is now much more than just a global bank. They invest $15 billion a year into technology and R&D. With JP Morgan Payments, you are getting their history of service, stability, and scale, but also innovation and new technology.\\n\\nDavid: Scale is really the key word here. Every episode, we talk about Hamilton Helmer\\'s seven powers, and boy, does JP Morgan have scale economies. What\\'s unique about their position in payments is that they can make massive infrastructure investments that benefit their customers in the near term, in addition to the long-term technology bets like blockchain or quantum computing. Since they move $10 trillion a day in 160 countries, these investments create a lot of shared value across their large customer base.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, not to mention the second of the Seven Powers\\' network economies.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. If you\\'re a JP Morgan payments customer, whether you\\'re a startup or a Fortune 500, you can access their payments partner network. This is a set of third party integrations across virtually every industry and payment use case. It makes it easy to discover what specific set of tools are best for your business.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s basically a B2B marketplace that connects their clients with the broader payments and technology ecosystem such as treasury management systems, ERPs, point of sale hardware solutions, payment gateways, and so much more. Given JP Morgan\\'s scale, you can imagine the value that comes with unlocking access to their industry leading partners and technology.\\n\\nDavid: Let\\'s take Visa, for example, which listeners may remember. We talked a lot on that episode about the power of a network. Visa works with JP Morgan to provide global payment processing services. Now through the partner network, you can easily add Visa as an acceptance method through a streamlined implementation with consolidated reporting. Other companies in the partner network include Oracle, American Express, MasterCard, Accenture, and many more including friends of the show, Modern Treasury.\\n\\nBen: Across any industry, the most successful companies we\\'ve talked about are the ones who think and invest strategically through a long-term lens. Like Hermes, durability and reliability are paramount for building hundred year companies that can reinvent and continue to grow. That is the case for JP Morgan Payments. Their history of trusted solutions and investments in technology bring clients and new fintech companies together to drive innovation and growth for businesses of all sizes.\\n\\nDavid: Before we jump back into Bill and Microsoft, who essentially wrote the modern playbook on building platforms, be sure to check out jpmorgan.com/acquired or click on the link in the show notes.\\n\\nBen: David, they\\'re like, it\\'s happening without us. What do they do?\\n\\nDavid: They do the natural thing that two super excited, ambitious, high octane college kids would do. They call up the main phone number of Altair\\'s manufacturer, a company called MITS and ask for the president, a man named Ed Roberts. Bill and Paul get them on the phone and they say, we have a BASIC interpreter, ready to go, ready to ship, for the 8080 Intel chip, and we want to provide it for you, for your machine.\\n\\nBen: Of course they don\\'t.\\n\\nDavid: They don\\'t have a single letter of code written. They don\\'t have anything.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s a market test. They want to know what\\'s the response if this were true.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Ed\\'s a bit of a character himself. He says, okay, well, guys, a lot of other people are calling me and saying the same thing. What I\\'m telling them, and I\\'m going to tell you too, is that anybody who can come here to my office in Albuquerque, New Mexico and demonstrate a working version of BASIC on my Altair will get a contract with us to distribute it when they go on sale. Bill and Paul say, okay, great, we\\'ll see you soon, and hang up. By ‘see you soon,’ they mean, ‘let\\'s go get to work.’\\n\\nBen: This is a big deal for MITS too if this works, because right now they\\'ve just announced a machine for which you can\\'t really do anything on it. The hardware is powerful, but they\\'re not going to have a lot of customers unless there\\'s stuff you can do on the machine. A BASIC interpreter running on it, it\\'s quite valuable to then make the claim you can program BASIC on our computer. They\\'re very excited about this, even though they\\'re playing coy.\\n\\nDavid: I was going to talk about this in a minute, but let\\'s talk about what the Altair is. What did they just announce in the magazine here? The Altair is the first mass market commercially available personal computer.\\n\\nBen: Again, no screen or anything.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Does not have a screen, does not have a keyboard, doesn\\'t have a display of any kind. What it does have is it has a set of 16 lights on the front of the machine, Christmas lights and 16 switches. You can flip the switches to flip bits, and then the machine will respond by lighting up different patterns of lights. It doesn\\'t come with any software. There\\'s nothing. That\\'s all it is, 16 lights, 16 switches.\\n\\nBen: In order to use it, you got to hook up your own teletype, you got to get the manual, you got to hope that the manual is right, and you got to code to the machine instructions, literally the assembly language for the chip inside for the Intel 8080.\\n\\nDavid: Back to the Traf-O-Data days and Paul writing the emulator for the 8008 at Washington State, Paul\\'s like, we got this. I\\'ll just write an emulator on the Harvard PDP-10 for the 8080 instruction set.\\n\\nBen: He does the same thing again. They get the manual, they have an emulator, and they write it against an emulator.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Bill writes the BASIC interpreter. In a couple of weeks, they\\'ve got it working. Ed\\'s like, okay, come on out to Albuquerque. Bill and Paul—remember, Bill still looks he\\'s 12 at this point in time—decide that just Paul should go.\\n\\nBen: Does Paul have a rocking beard at this point yet?\\n\\nDavid: Paul is super 70s. He is into it. As we\\'ll see, he\\'s going to fit right in at Albuquerque and MITS. Paul gets on a plane, flies from Boston to Albuquerque. In a total epic legend moment, they didn\\'t have a bootloader written for the BASIC interpreter.\\n\\nThey had the BASIC, it was all written, they\\'d done it on the emulator, and Paul\\'s flying out with the computer tape with the code of the BASIC interpreter on it. He\\'s like, oh, shoot, we can\\'t just feed that right into the machine. There\\'s got to be a bootloader to load up this thing. He writes the bootloader on the plane.\\n\\nBen: On paper, by hand, he is hand coding octal, not even assembly language instructions. He\\'s hand coding in pure octal the instructions to load their BASIC interpreter program into memory.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. He lands in Albuquerque, drives out to MITS. They load the bootloader onto the prototype Altair there that loads up the BASIC interpreter, and it fails. It doesn\\'t work. Paul\\'s like, oh, shoot, let\\'s try it again. Let\\'s try it again. They try it again. This is how early computing is. It works the second. Who knows what the bug was the first time. They didn\\'t change anything, it just didn\\'t work the first time, and it worked the second time.\\n\\nIt loads up, Paul writes in the instructions, print two plus two. It spits out four—by spits out, I mean the lights light up and say four. Both he and Ed, their jaws are on the floor. Paul\\'s like, oh, my God, the BASIC works. Ed\\'s like, oh, my God, the Altair works. Neither of them believed this was actually going to work.\\n\\nBen: Ed actually has more eggs in this basket than he let on because when Bill and Paul call and say, hey, can you give us the teletype instructions, he reveals they\\'re actually the only ones who called about that. Everyone else who said they were writing a BASIC never got far enough to ask, how do we actually interact with your computer?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Now is the time to say a few words about Ed and MITS. What is this company? Bill and Paul originally thought that it was going to be the IBMs, the DECs, the Japanese companies who are going to make the first microcomputers. MITS is about as far away from IBM as you can possibly imagine. MITS basically was a model rocket company.\\n\\nBen: Which, Albuquerque is a great place to do that.\\n\\nDavid: Ed Roberts, the founder, had been in the Air Force and stationed in Albuquerque. That\\'s how he got involved in model rocketry. The reason that they\\'re introducing the Altair and they made this big Splash in the magazine was this is a last ditch gambit to try and save the company. You got a bankrupt model rocketry company.\\n\\nBen: Their little gambit worked and got a couple of college kids to pounce.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Why did it work? They had two things going for them that really, Ed, I think probably personally made happen. (1) They got this splashy popular electronics magazine cover that was through a relationship that Ed had. (2) The sticker price was $397, which is about $2300 in 2024 dollars. Yes, that\\'s a lot of money, but the next cheapest computer that anybody could buy at this point in time was a DEC, a $120,000 mini computer. The idea that somebody could buy a computer for $400, I don\\'t care who\\'s selling that thing, I want that.\\n\\nBen: What did they get, some sweet deal from Intel?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This is all Ed\\'s doing. The list price from Intel for the 8080 chip was $360. I think this is part of what was deterring the market of how would anybody sell a kit that was affordably priced when so much of the cost of goods would go to Intel with the processor deal. He managed to negotiate a volume deal with Intel to get 8080 chips at $75 a pop. That was the key unlock.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s a 5X price reduction.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I wasn\\'t able to find how that negotiation went down or why Ed Roberts in Albuquerque, New Mexico got this sweetheart deal from Intel.\\n\\nBen: Either the list price is wildly wrong, or they were cutting deals all over the place. One thing it could have been is just that, and I\\'m totally speculating, but chips are the ultimate high fixed cost investment, low marginal costs next to software.\\n\\nYou could imagine maybe Intel had already put all the money into the fixed costs of spinning up the fabs and was expecting a certain amount of market demand, and they weren\\'t seeing it. They were like, crap, we\\'ve got to recoup our investment. I don\\'t know, lower the price, let them just sell. Maybe we\\'ll make it up in volume.\\n\\nDavid: I like that. I have no idea, but that\\'s a totally viable train of thought here. Either way, he gets the sweetheart deal. Not only does it make computer history and enable and create Microsoft, it saves the company of MITS.\\n\\nThey were on the edge of bankruptcy. After the popular electronics article comes out, they get 4000 pre-orders in the first month or two, which is $1.5 million in revenue, cash paid upfront. That is pure cash hitting the bank account.\\n\\nBen: That will save a company.\\n\\nDavid: And also just proves 4000 people just paid cash sight unseen for 16 lights and switches. There\\'s a lot of demand for a home computer here.\\n\\nBen: At decent margins too, if they\\'re getting the processor for $72, and they\\'re selling it for what did you say?\\n\\nDavid: $397.\\n\\nBen: Everything else in there is much cheaper than the processor, so I don\\'t know. Depending on how much they have to give to the sales channel they\\'re selling through, if it\\'s retail or distributors.\\n\\nDavid: I think they\\'re selling direct. I think people are just sending money orders.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s a decent margin business. Unlike what the PC business would become over time, they managed to have nice margins.\\n\\nDavid: Paul and Ed hit it off. Paul decides to move out to Albuquerque to be close to the action here. He actually joins MITS as their vice president of Software. He\\'s vice president of a software department of one. He is the software department here.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, software department of one, but he\\'s got his buddy Bill Gates who is not employed, but Bill\\'s definitely working on software for the Altar as well.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Bill stays at Harvard, but keeps cranking on enhancing the BASIC interpreter and adding more functions and functionality to the version of BASIC that they had just written for the Altair. Once the school year is over, he comes out to Albuquerque for the summer.\\n\\nThe Altair is getting ready to ship with the Microsoft BASIC included in it. Bill and Paul need to set up a company, but Paul is an employee of MITS at this point, so what did they do? They set up a partnership. The founding of Microsoft, at this point Micro-Soft, is a two-person partnership between Bill and Paul.\\n\\nBen: As we record this, that was 49 years and one day ago. We are sitting here on April 5th recording. That was April 4th, 1975. It is very funny to look back at some of the original signatures when Bill writes on letters. It\\'s Bill Gates, the general partner of Micro-Soft, which is great. I think it\\'s actually a Paul Allen name where he wants to put together microcomputer and software. Bill\\'s like, that\\'s perfect, we\\'re immediately just going to run with it. As it was a partnership, originally, they were going to call it something like Allen and Gates, and then they ultimately are like, no, Micro-Soft is perfect.\\n\\nDavid: Microsoft has become Kleenex. Microsoft means microprocessor software.\\n\\nBen: I will say it\\'s a nice clarifying North Star because it really draws the line in the sand and says, we\\'re in the software business. Gates makes this really clear to Paul Allen, who is often tempted to do hardware stuff. Bill is very hardcore about saying, no, what we\\'re uniquely good at in the world is software and we should stick to that.\\n\\nI also suspect Bill is starting to realize that there\\'s an amazing business model here if we can pull it off, where we don\\'t have to make the hardware, and we can charge for every copy of the software sold. But that insight, I would say, has not yet fully materialized.\\n\\nDavid: Let\\'s talk about business model here in one sec. First though on the partnership. Again, we\\'ve been saying all along that Bill is clearly the leader here. They set up the partnership. Initially, it\\'s 60/40 ownership, Bill is 60%, Paul is 40%. Later, it gets changed to Bill is 64% and Paul is 36%. Yup, Bill is the leader here.\\n\\nBen: Bill\\'s case that he makes on that to Paul is, hey, you took a job and you were doing this on the side, I was all in. Paul\\'s an agreeable guy, and 36% is still a nice percent, so he says, sure.\\n\\nDavid: In the long run here, everybody gets nuts. It\\'s all a rounding error, but to that point back to the business model. Once the partnership is set up, they sign an exclusive licensing arrangement with MITS. This is super important. This is a big lesson that young Bill and Paul are going to learn here.\\n\\nMITS gets exclusive license to the BASIC interpreter to the BASIC as they call it for the 8080. MITS is the one that can then decide whether to sublicense the BASIC out to other companies or not.\\n\\nEssentially, this is a distribution deal with MITS, where MITS becomes the exclusive seller and distributor of Microsoft\\'s BASIC. Microsoft doesn\\'t have any direct sales control here, and it\\'s going to become a big, big, big issue. The terms of the deal are Microsoft is to get $30 for each copy of BASIC that MITS sells plus 50% of the revenue that comes from the sublicensing deals that MITS may or may not do with other companies who want to use the BASIC.\\n\\nBen: Why would they ever do any sublicensing deals? Why would you give it to your competitors?\\n\\nDavid: That is a really good question, Ben.\\n\\nBen: Let\\'s just round that part of the revenue to zero.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. This is a big, big, big divergence of interest between Microsoft and MITS. The kicker on this contract is that the total amount of lifetime revenue that Microsoft can make from the BASIC from MITS is capped at $180,000. Ed admits really has the upper hand in this deal.\\n\\nBen: Or phrased another way, we will give you $180,000 for you to hand over exclusive rights to all that cool BASIC stuff you just wrote to us. But if we sell fewer than X machines, we\\'re actually going to pay it out to you on a prorated basis at $30 a pop rather than giving you the full $180,000.\\n\\nDavid: That is another way to frame it. Definitely, a great deal for MITS. On the other hand, what are Bill and Paul going to do here?\\n\\nBen: Right, a great deal for them too given the position they\\'re in.\\n\\nDavid: Right, MITS is the industry. There is one very, very important clause in the contract though, protecting Microsoft\\'s interests. That clause is that MITS must use its best efforts to license, promote, and commercialize the BASIC broadly in the marketplace. Any failure to do so by MITS would be grounds for termination of the contract by Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: Thank God, Bill\\'s dad is a lawyer.\\n\\nDavid: Indeed. The Altair comes out for sale later in 1975. Microsoft does $16,000 in revenue that year from their $30 a pop, the BASICs that are getting sold with the Altair, which is great, especially the first year that they\\'re starting.\\n\\nThe next year in 1976, everybody\\'s so excited about this new market, the vision that\\'s happening, the demand, the Altair, the sales that Paul Allen resigns from MITS to join Microsoft full-time. Bill drops out of Harvard officially. He moves to Albuquerque. They\\'re all in on this. But for the year in 1976, Microsoft\\'s revenue is still only $22,000. It was $16,000 the year before, $22,000 in 1976.\\n\\nBen: Not a high growth company.\\n\\nDavid: This is less than they were making in high school. What is going on here? (1) MITS is the one at the controls of sales, not Microsoft. (2) MITS is selling a thousand computers a month. This is taking off. This is creating a new industry. Despite MITS selling thousands of computers a month, only a few hundred copies of BASIC are selling per month. What\\'s going on? People are pirating the software. This is the discovery of software piracy.\\n\\nBen: This is a pretty interesting time to pause and say, are they pirating software?\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s a good question.\\n\\nBen: This is 1975. Piracy implies that you are running afoul of some particular legal protection for the good. You might say, well, with today\\'s legal frameworks in hindsight, you would say, of course, if they\\'re copying the software and not paying the money for it, it\\'s piracy. That was actually not established yet. This is the craziest thing. Bill basically has an opinion that it\\'s piracy, and he writes letters to the computer community.\\n\\nDavid: He writes an open letter to hobbyists.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and tries to basically guilt trip people. He tries to use that as a recruiting method and say, if you\\'re so excited about pirating our software, maybe you should just come work with us. Nothing would make me happier than making the best software in the world, and please join us on this mission. But ultimately, the legal standing that he has to say, hey, what you\\'re doing is illegal, is not fully established.\\n\\nIt would actually take a couple of years for the courts to look at software and say, what about this is protectable? If you think about it, it is a little bit weird. You\\'ve got source code that looks like English, BASIC, it\\'s letters and numbers. It gets translated to machine code. That machine code ends up running, and it\\'s basically electrons. It\\'s voltages that are flipped up and down. What about that are we trying to protect?\\n\\nUltimately, the way it gets litigated through some case law from court cases is that the source code is a copyrightable, creative work that is expressed through some tangible medium. That\\'s the important thing about copyright law. It\\'s a creative work expressed through a tangible medium. A book, the creative work is the words and the tangible medium is printed on paper.\\n\\nWith software, it actually took until 1980. Congress changed the law. We\\'ll put a link in the show notes to the literal congressional change that happened. It is in Title 17, Copyrights Chapter 1, Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright. In 1980, they include a defined term, which is a \"computer program is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.” Once you have that passed by Congress codified into law, you now have the standing legal framework that all the whole computer industry used going forward, in particular, the software industry, a computer program is copyrightable work.\\n\\nDavid: Wow, I didn\\'t know all, that\\'s awesome.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s totally crazy how recent that is. But when you think about it, why would that have any legal…? Software is such an abstract idea. Before, the whole business model of computers was good luck just replicating an IBM PC and everything that comes with it. You don\\'t need any legal standing. But if you\\'re going to pursue this software only business model, what\\'s the protection around your abstract product?\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s exactly what I was going to say here. This is the other element of what\\'s going on. This is the first time software has ever been sold. Other than the IBM accounting machinations to protect themselves from antitrust, which was just accounting, nobody had ever sold software before. This is the first time.\\n\\nBen: Certainly to build a legitimate business around it. The other thing that\\'s useful to know is when you\\'re selling an IBM PC, you\\'re literally selling a PC to a customer the same way that when I\\'m selling you this glass. From crate and barrel, I am selling you the glass, and the glass is now yours. I\\'ve transferred property to you.\\n\\nSoftware is not that, so the whole world of software is built on a license agreement. The source code that computer program the actual right of that is retained by the creator, and you license the copyright to your customer to be able to use that on their machine.\\n\\nThere\\'s this dual idea that computer software is copyrightable, and you can grant a license under certain conditions for customers to use it. That is the legal framework for which the next 50 years of technology at large would operate under.\\n\\nDavid: For the moment though...\\n\\nBen: They have a piracy problem.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The law isn\\'t going to change until 1980. Microsoft would be dead if they didn\\'t figure out a solution to this before 1980. This is when Bill ultimately realizes, shoot, we did the wrong business deal with MITS here. MITS has to sell, and customers have to make the decision buy our BASIC. It\\'s a key critical part of the value of the computer. It\\'s the whole thing.\\n\\nBen: It makes that machine useful.\\n\\nDavid: Without it, it is not useful. It\\'s totally setting up the wrong incentives and value equation that customers should be buying this themselves. It should be included by the hardware OEM in the machine that they are selling and in the total purchase price. If that happens, We no longer have a piracy problem because we\\'re just getting paid as part of the purchase of the machine.\\n\\nBen: Right, it should be a royalty.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The problem is that is not the deal that they had with MITS.\\n\\nBen: Right, or framed differently. Instead of saying, hey, consumer, do you want to buy something else too and make a new purchase decision, they should be saying, hey computer manufacturer, we make your thing actually useful, so pay us for it.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. During 1975 and 1976, MITS pretty much had this new microcomputer market all to themselves. There were a couple of other competitors who sprung up, but nothing made. The Altair and MITS was the microcomputer company.\\n\\nAll that changes, though, in a big way in 1977, when what Byte Magazine calls the 1977 Trinity hits the market. That is three machines, the Tandy/RadioShack TRS-80, the Commodore Personal Electronic Transactor, or the acronym PET, and the Apple II. All three of which machines were like the Altair, low cost, mass market.\\n\\nUnlike the Altair, they were not kits. They were fully assembled, fully functional, right out of the box, and they each had their own major distribution advantages. In Bill\\'s words, these three machines, the 1977 Trinity, ignite volume in the market. Bill loves these really dramatic verbs like we attacked the manual, they ignite the volume in the market.\\n\\nBen: The press just latches on to him. Whenever Bill has a leaked memo or something where he talks about all this war terminology, those all become headlines.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s so great. Earlier, during 1976, Microsoft had started getting approached by a few of the bigger computing companies NCR (National Cash Register), GE, Control Data Systems. I want to license Microsoft BASIC for the 8080 microprocessor here so that we can experiment with these things. Each of these deals would have been revenue to Microsoft of $100,000-ish.\\n\\nEd and MITS, they keep dragging their feet on negotiating these. They\\'ve got the exclusive license. Everything\\'s got to go through MITS. Most of them are turning down because Ben, you said, they don\\'t want anybody to come in and compete with them.\\n\\nBen: Yup, there\\'s the misaligned incentive.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s the misaligned incentive. There is the clause that Bill and Microsoft, and I presume Bill Sr. put in the original agreement—is MITS is using its best efforts to commercialize the BASIC and gain adoption in the market? You can make a pretty strong argument that they\\'re not.\\n\\nEd, though, unbeknownst to Bill and Paul, has another reason that he\\'s dragging his feet on these deals, which is that he\\'s about to sell the company. In May of 1977, MITS gets acquired by the tape drive manufacturer, Pertec, for $6.5 million. Ed rides off into the sunset.\\n\\nPertec knows about this dispute with Microsoft, and they come in and they figure, who is this Bill Gates? He\\'s a 21-year-old kid, a college dropout, we\\'re a big company, we can deal with this. Robert says an amazing quote later. He says, \"Pertec kept telling me they could deal with this kid. It was a little Roosevelt telling Churchill that he could deal with Stalin.\"\\n\\nBen: Oh, my God.\\n\\nDavid: I also don\\'t think they realized that this kid\\'s dad is one of the best corporate attorneys in the country.\\n\\nBen: Bill Gates was just constantly underestimated, which worked to his advantage in those early days.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: This is the thing about Microsoft. People forget how insanely young Bill was. He was just 20. To put that in context, he\\'s only 7 years older than Jensen Huang, but they feel an entire generation apart since Microsoft was started almost 20 years before NVIDIA. When you start bending your mind around like, oh, Bill Gates is still pretty young, considering what an institution Microsoft has become in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Microsoft next year is going to have its 50th anniversary. I believe that\\'ll also be the same year that Bill turns 70. That\\'s wild.\\n\\nBen: Yeah.\\n\\nDavid: That fall in 1977. The dispute between MITS/Pertec and Microsoft goes to arbitration in Albuquerque. The interim months while this arbitration is happening are the only moment in Microsoft\\'s history where cash gets tight. They\\'re running out of money because they can\\'t really make any sales here.\\n\\nBen: They don\\'t control their destiny.\\n\\nDavid: People aren\\'t paying MITS for the BASIC. They\\'re \"pirating\" the software. They can\\'t do deals with all the other computer companies that want to come licensed directly, so things get a little tight. Microsoft ends up winning the arbitration, I believe, in maybe November 1977, meaning they are now totally free to license BASIC to anybody who wants to buy it on any terms that they want.\\n\\nThey turn around. They immediately license it to Trinity, Apple, Commodore, Radio Shack, and Tandy. They license it to all the big companies, the GEs, the NCRs, who want to experiment with microcomputers.\\n\\nThere\\'s a really funny story with Apple that apparently, Woz had more or less written 95% of their own BASIC. But it didn\\'t have floating point numbers, it only had integer numbers. Jobs is totally writing Woz. He\\'s like, the BASIC is really important. Can you just finish it? Can you do floating point? Woz just doesn\\'t do it, so Jobs has to go license Microsoft\\'s BASIC. Amazing.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s the first deal that happens between the companies. There\\'s so many deals done, both directions, commercial deals, equity deals, legal disputes in both directions. This is the very first time that they do something together.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Bill, Paul, and Microsoft, do all these deals. They do them all as cash upfront, fixed cost, all you companies, you\\'re going to pay us. You include the BASIC in the machines that you\\'re selling, and we\\'re going to get all the money up front. Super presciently, though, Bill does not value maximize on these deals.\\n\\nThe Apple deal is $31,000 for eight years of access for Apple for the Apple II Microsoft\\'s BASIC. They\\'re not price gouging here because Bill sees, he\\'s like, the play here is we want to make it a no brainer for everybody who\\'s selling a microcomputer to have Microsoft\\'s BASIC on it, because we want to set the standard.\\n\\nIf we are the standard programming environment that anybody who\\'s using these computers—and again, anybody who is using these computers is programming them, they\\'re used to the Microsoft version of BASIC—we\\'re going to have so much power that it\\'ll become a self-fulfilling prophecy. All of our competitors will just wither away. Nobody will want them because it\\'s not going to be compatible with the language everybody knows. Once people start trading and then ultimately developing and selling software that they\\'ve written, it\\'s only going to run on our BASIC interpreter, not anybody else\\'s.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating. I actually didn\\'t know that it started this early. One correction there, you don\\'t know for a fact it\\'s only going to run on Microsoft\\'s BASIC interpreter, but you do know for a fact that it will run on Microsoft\\'s BASIC interpreter. If it\\'s cheap enough, why would you take the chance on a clone that might have one or two things wrong with it?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Basically, his vision is, I want to remove any oxygen from any argument anyone could have about not using Microsoft\\'s BASIC on a microcomputer. He thinks about this concept as a positive spiral that he really in his mind is the reason for Microsoft\\'s success.\\n\\nHe says, “Success reinforces success. In a growing market, one way of doing something gets a slight advantage over its competitors, this is most likely to happen with high technology products that can be made in great volume for a very little increase in cost.” If you get that slight advantage, it\\'ll compound, and this is what he\\'s playing for here.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s interesting. In the earliest days, what was stopping someone else from writing a BASIC interpreter and licensing it to Apple or RadioShack? Nothing. There were other smart people out there. It was just a very good business decision to say, we got to close that door. We just got to make this a no-brainer for people to buy from us, because if we\\'re value maximizing and it\\'s starting to feel expensive, they\\'re going to turn elsewhere until we get a lead.\\n\\nDavid: The Apple story is the perfect example. The Woz thing is cute, it makes for a good story, and oh, he didn\\'t finish the BASIC. But when Microsoft sold them the BASIC, which was already getting established as the standard for $31,000...\\n\\nBen: Sure. Why not?\\n\\nDavid: No brainer. Apple could have gone out and hired another programmer to finish the BASIC. They\\'re like, wait, we could do that, or I could just get the standard one for $31,000. I\\'m going to do that.\\n\\nBen: Just because it\\'s important to establish there are trade offs for everything, if you\\'re running a startup right now, you might think to yourself, oh, great. I\\'ll just run that exact strategy. The important thing here is (a) Most of the work was already done for the original BASIC. (b) Bill was doing it himself, Bill and Paul, so the importance of technical co-founders. Their overhead was crazy low.\\n\\nThey could do these deals where they don\\'t make very much money. I think at the end of 1977, there were five employees. Their overhead was just so unbelievably low that they could take a really long lens.\\n\\nDavid: Even though it takes until the very end of 1977 when the MITS dispute gets resolved and Microsoft can actually make money again, they end 1977 with $381,000 in revenue, despite zero for the first 11 months of the year. They\\'re just rolling in cash. This is when Bill famously goes out and buys a green Porsche 911 and is motoring around Albuquerque, getting all sorts of speeding tickets and hilarious stuff.\\n\\nBen: This is when he got his mugshot, right?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I think that\\'s right.\\n\\nBen: This is the classic Bill Gates holding up the...\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Amazing.\\n\\nBen: He got, I think, three speeding tickets in one day, two of which were from the same police officer.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and there are funny stories of the Albuquerque police thought, how is a kid driving a Porsche 911? He must be a drug dealer or something.\\n\\nBen: Even when he was 20–21, he looked 17.\\n\\nDavid: Right. It\\'s like, do you even have a driver\\'s license?\\n\\nBen: Wild.\\n\\nDavid: Back to what you\\'re saying, it\\'s a really, really important point. To make this dynamic work, you need to be able to afford the investment in the fixed cost for the software, for the technology to make it that little bit superior, like Bill\\'s talking about, the slight advantage over the competitors. At this moment in time, the industry is completely brand new. The software industry is brand new.\\n\\nThe amount that that fixed costs takes, the cost is quite low. Really, it\\'s just Bill and Paul\\'s time and dedication to this industry that nobody else is making that investment. You can\\'t run this playbook today because in any market, even a brand new market, even a speculative market, the minimum viable fixed cost is billions of dollars.\\n\\nBen: Right. Yeah, that\\'s interesting. I also think this moment galvanized something important, which is Bill and Paul could look around and see that there is going to be so much value created by microcomputers and by software. They really found religion around software is magic. The things that people can create now that we\\'ve done this BASIC interpreter and these machines are cheap and plentiful. The magic will take care of itself as long as we ensure this industry can just exist and do its thing.\\n\\nThey flipped from this mode of we need to bite and scratch and claw, and make sure that we win in deals to, huh, how can we enable software as a thing to thrive? I\\'m sure we can position ourselves well to capture some or a lot of that. I think they became almost stewards of the software industry and evangelists from this point forward.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. They also do another really prescient thing the next year in 1978, which is they go global.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Nobody else is going global yet, and the way that this happens is so fun. Bill gets a call one day.\\n\\nBen: Also, how crazy is it? You\\'ve got five people, you\\'re operating out of Albuquerque, you just finally expanded from having one customer, and you\\'re like, you know what we should do this year? Let\\'s open in Japan and become an international company.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. The way this happens is one day, Bill gets a call from a guy named Kazuhiko Nishi, or Kay Nishi, who\\'s a computer enthusiast in Japan, has gotten a hold of Microsoft BASIC, and totally shares the same vision as Bill and Paul. He doesn\\'t have a Paul nor is he technical himself.\\n\\nHe\\'s like, I\\'m going to bring you guys to Japan. I\\'m going to bring you to all the big computer companies. They agree that Kay will become Microsoft\\'s exclusive distribution partner in Japan. By the next year in 1979, half of Microsoft\\'s revenue is coming from Japan, which is wild.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s unbelievable, and it stayed at that very high run rate of an international being a huge chunk, close to half always basically forever. This is a huge cornerstone of Microsoft\\'s success that they were an international company from year three of their existence.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Revenue in 1977, that last month of revenue was almost $400,000. 1978 revenue is $1.3 million.\\n\\nBen: They have 13 employees at this point.\\n\\nDavid: In 1979, revenue is $2.4 million. At the end of that year, they\\'re like, all right, we got to get out of Albuquerque.\\n\\nBen: They\\'ve got 25 employees, I believe, at that point.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, something like that. This is when they moved to Seattle. It\\'s interesting to hear Bill talk about this. He actually really liked Albuquerque. Specifically, there weren\\'t any distractions there.\\n\\nBen: No distractions, weather was great.\\n\\nDavid: Everybody was happy there, but the big problem was recruiting. He\\'s like, if we\\'re going to build this into the opportunity that I see, the vision that I see and that Paul shares with me, there\\'s no way we\\'re going to do that in Albuquerque. We got to move to a hub.\\n\\nBen: He\\'s got three reasons for why Seattle in particular. By the way, it worked. Every single person except for his secretary did make the move. (1) He grew up in Seattle. He\\'s like, I just want to go home. He justifies it in two other ways, which I found pretty fascinating. This is from an interview in the early 90s that he did.\\n\\nHe said it basically came down to Seattle or Silicon Valley. In Silicon Valley, it\\'s hard to keep secrets because there\\'s a rumor mill. In Seattle, we can be a little bit more removed, and we can announce things when we want to announce them.\\n\\n(2) In Silicon Valley, people switch around companies. I don\\'t want that. I want people to just work at Microsoft. There was a disadvantage to not being able to recruit from your competitors, but for a while, they were really the only game in town in Seattle.\\n\\nDavid: But not really, though, because pretty quickly, Microsoft is such an important part of the industry. They recruit from Silicon Valley, too. We\\'re going to talk about some of the people who come up. You\\'re totally right, people stay at Microsoft. They don\\'t leave. This continues right through to this day.\\n\\nThe other thing that I think is really important to say that makes it work for Seattle in a way that I don\\'t know that this could have worked in too many other places in the country is the University of Washington. The computer science department there was really good. There were great people. Steve Russell had come out there. There was real talent, and they were churning out graduates out of the U-Dub that would go on to populate Microsoft for decades to come.\\n\\nBen: Bill, of course, reinvested in that flywheel, donating tons of money to the university. There are buildings, there are whole new schools.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, absolutely. They played right into it.\\n\\nBen: Today, it\\'s always a top 10, if not top 5 computer science program in the country. But unlike other top computer science programs, it\\'s a state school, so it just has huge volumes. I think more students come out of the University of Washington and go to big tech than any other program in the country. That has stayed this amazing advantage.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I think the only thing even close to it is Berkeley in the Bay Area with a lot of the same dynamics. But there\\'s Stanford there too, so it\\'s a dual university system in the Bay Area. You cannot overstate how important the University of Washington was to this decision and an ultimate success of coming to Seattle.\\n\\nThis brings us to 1980 in the beginning of the year when they move to Seattle, just in time for, I think you can make a very strong argument, the single most important deal ever done in the history of technology. It\\'s crazy to even say it now, the Microsoft-IBM PC partnership.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s crazy. You have this absolute behemoth partnering with someone that\\'s not really relevant. If you\\'re standing here today, it sounds like I\\'m talking about Microsoft partnering with IBM. At the time, it was IBM partnering with Microsoft. It was the only computer company that mattered in the entire world, got themselves into a particular situation where they came to Microsoft looking for help. It\\'s the craziest set of events that made this possible, and I can\\'t wait to dive into it.\\n\\nDavid: Me too. Before we do, this is the perfect time to talk about another one of our favorite enterprise software platforms, ServiceNow, who is one of our big partners here in Season 14.\\n\\nBen: ServiceNow is the AI platform for your enterprise, helping automate processes, improve service delivery, and increase efficiency. Over 85% of the Fortune 500 runs on them, and they have quickly joined the Microsofts and the NVIDIAs as one of the most important enterprise technology vendors in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Just like those companies, ServiceNow has AI baked in everywhere in their platform, and they\\'re also a major partner of both Microsoft and NVIDIA. I was at NVIDIA\\'s GTC last week, which, by the way, was insane. I felt like a VIP at a Taylor Swift concert, it was crazy. Jensen brought up ServiceNow and their partnership many times throughout the keynote.\\n\\nWhy is ServiceNow so important both to NVIDIA and to Microsoft? AI in the real world is only as good as the bedrock platform infrastructure it runs on. For enterprises around the world, ServiceNow manages that infrastructure.\\n\\nAll the AI applications for enterprises, whether that\\'s supercharging developers with generative AI, empowering and streamlining customer service, allowing HR to deliver better employee experiences, ServiceNow has already done the hard technical work to make rolling them out not just possible, but easy and fast.\\n\\nBen: Employees can get answers quickly with smarter self-service like changing 401(k) contributions directly through AI powered chat, or developers can build apps faster with AI powered code generation, and service agents can use AI to notify you that someone\\'s product needs replacing before they even chat with you about it. With the ServiceNow platform, your business is 100% ready for AI. Simply turn it on, and it all works.\\n\\nDavid: They\\'ve built AI directly into their platform, so all the integration work to prepare for it that otherwise would have taken you years is already done. If you want to learn more about the ServiceNow platform and how it can turbocharge the time to deploy AI for your business, go on over to servicenow.com/acquired. When you get in touch, just tell them that Ben and David sent you.\\n\\nThe IBM PC. Why is IBM getting into the personal computer here in 1980? A fun quote we heard in our research was that IBM was the sun, the moon, the stars of the computing industry. That meant the hardcore enterprise mainframe computing industry.\\n\\nBen: David, are you going to attribute that quote or are you going to leave listeners just hanging?\\n\\nDavid: All right, I think it\\'s time. We talked to probably 10 early Microsoft people in research and preparation. One of those folks was Steve Ballmer himself. He used those words in describing IBM.\\n\\nBen: And it\\'s hard to imagine a better person to get their perspective on what IBM meant to the world at this point in time, because 1980 was also the year that Steve joined Microsoft. Literally at the same time in 1980, you\\'ve got the management team coming together with Steve, Bill, and Paul Allen, and you\\'ve got the IBM thing going on, and you\\'ve got them moving to Seattle. We haven\\'t even talked about Charles Simonyi yet, but this was the year he joined.\\n\\nDavid: This is the year. Every year for Microsoft until this point is the year, but 1980 is big.\\n\\nBen: Okay, so why is IBM the sun, the moon, and the stars of computing? Why are they getting into this PC? It\\'s way cheaper than anything else they sell. It seems to be a totally different business strategy, a different customer set. What\\'s going on?\\n\\nDavid: All the early microcomputers we were just talking about, the Altair, the Apple II, the TRS-80, are all 8-bit machines. They\\'re running the Intel 8080 processor or a competitor making a similar 8-bit processor. The problem with an 8-bit processor is that the maximum data size for a given instruction cycle in the processor—this is called a data word in computer science terminology—is 256, 28. You can\\'t represent any number greater than 256 in any given CPU clock cycle in an 8-bit machine.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s effectively a bandwidth limitation, where if you\\'re in a single clock cycle trying to do some particular instruction, it\\'s a very, very small amount of data that you can move through the arithmetic logic unit or that you can move through the processor in that clock cycle.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. You could think of it as an hourglass or something. There\\'s all the data sitting there in memory at the top of the hourglass, and then there\\'s this small little funnel that it goes through. That\\'s the processor, and then it comes out.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s a good analogy. It\\'s going to take forever.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, into the application of the software that the user sees. You just are not really going to process it that fast.\\n\\nBen: Very primitive machines.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. For a company IBM, they eclipsed the 8-bit computing cycle a long, long, long time ago. Mainframes, even minicomputers with DEC, all these machines are at least 16-bit, if not 32-bit computing machines. 8-bit is just not interesting.\\n\\nBen: Which is why they only cost $375 or whatever for an Altair.\\n\\nDavid: Right. In late 1979, Intel announces that they\\'re coming out with the 8086 processor, which is a 16-bit microprocessor. With 16 bits, you can really start to do some damage here in terms of the applications that you could put on this thing to eat into business software use cases.\\n\\nBen: In 16 bits, you can represent numbers up to 65,536, so that\\'s two to the 16th. You can do interesting things passing 16 bits around at once.\\n\\nDavid: There are some really, really fun aspects to this. If you look at pictures of these processors, what did the 8080, the 8-bit processor look like? And then you look at what the 8086, the 16-bit processor, looked like? You can see this.\\n\\nIn the 8008 processor that\\'s only eight bits, you see only nine pins coming off of the little chip. There\\'s the eight pins for the data bits, and then I think there\\'s one more control pin. If you look at the 8086 processor, it\\'s a much longer rectangle with 16, 17, maybe 20 pins coming off of it. You see this physically represented in the chip.\\n\\nBen: The further we get in the computing world, the more abstract stuff becomes. It\\'s always fun to go back in history when these concepts were so grounded in our physical reality that\\'s easily observable since everything was so much bigger too.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Back in 1980, the 8086 has been announced, 16-bit microprocessor is coming. IBM has already lived through missing a computing expansion era once with DEC and the minicomputer. They just let DEC take that market. Of course, that didn\\'t really hurt IBM, but man, it would have been nice to also have that market too.\\n\\nBen: The thing that they\\'re observing about the microcomputer market is it\\'s exploding. People in our industry know about DEC, people in the broader world never knew about DEC. But I think it\\'s a very different rate of adoption and rate of demand with microcomputers where IBM started to look at and go, oh, this might be a really big computer market for people.\\n\\nDavid: They\\'re finally observing the same thing that Bill and Paul did all the way back in the Traf-O-Date days of this is an exponential cycle. Moore\\'s law, this is exponential, and exponential gets real big very quickly once you get a few years in.\\n\\nBen: Yup.\\n\\nDavid: The mini computer cycle never was that. It\\'s hard to remember today, but just to underscore this again, in 1980, IBM was the most valuable company in the entire world, the highest market cap company, bigger than all the oil companies in 1980.\\n\\nBen: The sun, the moon, and the stars.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Do you know what their market capital was?\\n\\nBen: In 1980, $150 billion?\\n\\nDavid: You are almost an order of magnitude off $34 billion. That was the most valuable company. It is wild what a different world we live in today.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, even inflation adjusted, it\\'s interesting that the rate of growth of the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap has far outpaced inflation.\\n\\nDavid: That company, the most valuable in the world, they\\'re going to tiny little Microsoft that\\'s just moved to Seattle for this partnership. What\\'s going on here? This is just so amazing. They deserve so much credit here. They got the Clay Christensen disrupt yourself, disruptive technology thing intuitively decades before Clay writes any of this stuff.\\n\\nThe way that they decide to compete is all the things that Clay wrote about are working against us here. What we need to do is we need to create essentially a skunk works division, just our Lockheed episode. We need to do something outside the company, completely removed from the politics, sure, but the business incentives not to disrupt ourselves, and create a new division they called the entry level systems division. Actually, it may have existed before, but they repurpose it.\\n\\nBen: This is in Boca Raton?\\n\\nDavid: In Boca Raton, Florida. Very nice place. We were just there a couple of months ago, but not a technology hotbed in the world. They create a secret project called Project Chess, secret from the rest of the company, the whole world. The goal is to develop the IBM microcomputer or the personal computer, as people are starting to refer to microcomputers.\\n\\nThis is wild. They\\'re going to do it in secret with a small team with no other IBM resources. That means this small team, the only way they can do it is to use all off-the-shelf components from technology providers, basically play on the same level playing field as all the other microcomputer manufacturers out there.\\n\\nOne more thing, IBM leadership tells this team in Boca, they have to ship the PC to customers within one year.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s a crazy constraint.\\n\\nDavid: It is a total crazy constraint. A couple of quotes on this. Don Estridge, who is one of the leaders of Project Chess, would later say that the company realized that if you\\'re going to compete against people who started in a garage, obviously a reference to Apple here, you have to start in a garage yourself. Lou Gerstner, who later would take over IBM, would describe this whole Boca project as, \"The way you get an elephant to tap dance.\"\\n\\nBen: The question is, are they playing from behind and thus have to adopt a flawed strategy, or is this strategy of assembling with all off-the-shelf components actually a good strategy if it works?\\n\\nDavid: Let\\'s tell the story and then come back to it.\\n\\nBen: Great.\\n\\nDavid: Okay. What do they do? The hardware aspect of this is trivial, basically. Ed Roberts could put together the hardware to sell a microcomputer and do this deal with Intel. I think IBM can do a deal with Intel, not necessarily trickier but the more important part is the software. Thanks to Bill\\'s genius strategy about be the volume player, don\\'t optimize on per unit price, set the standards out there.\\n\\nBen: They were the world\\'s leading provider of programming language interpreters, right?\\n\\nDavid: 100%. There is one game in town and one game in town only, and that is Microsoft in Bellevue, Washington at this point in time.\\n\\nBen: Now, interpreters are notably different from operating systems, but Microsoft definitely has raised the flag. Everyone could see, if I want to go buy software for my computers, broadly, they\\'re an interesting group to talk to.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Obviously, operating systems are going to become really, really big here in just a sec. Again, the 8-bit generation operating systems weren\\'t that important because people were writing their own software. The standardized software, packaged application software doesn\\'t happen until the 16-bit era and doesn\\'t really, really happen until the 16-bit era and the IBM PC. That\\'s why BASIC the interpreter is so important.\\n\\nWhat happens? IBM calls up Bill Gates. By August, 1980, the two companies are in serious talks to partner and work together on the IBM PC. We referenced Steve Ballmer a minute ago. The timing is just crazy. Steve had just joined the company in June of 1980.\\n\\nBen: He\\'s employee number 30.\\n\\nDavid: The Microsoft team of 30, which the whole company of Microsoft pivots to work on the IBM PC partnership, is bigger than the Project Chess team in Boca.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s amazing.\\n\\nDavid: Wow. Okay, Bill has just convinced Steve to drop out of business school at Stanford and come help him and Paul run the company. Microsoft at this point in time is still a partnership. Steve is the first person besides Bill and Paul to get equity in the company when he joins. It\\'s 8.5% and it\\'s a handshake deal at this point.\\n\\nBen: Bill really, really wanted to bring Steve on. He knew him from the Harvard days, knew what an asset he could be.\\n\\nDavid: He is the Yin of Bill\\'s Yang.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Frankly, 8.5%, it\\'s a big grant. Who\\'s out there running a 30-person company, and you\\'re giving away 8.5% slugs? That just doesn\\'t happen. Those are founder shares. This is really a reflection that the way that Bill thought about Steve was as a founder.\\n\\nIn fact, it created some tension with Paul Allen, where Bill asked Paul, if they could go to 5%, Paul said, sure. And then Bill actually offered him 8.5%. Paul got upset and Bill said, I\\'ll eat the 3.5%. It can come out of my share because I want him that bad.\\n\\nDavid: He\\'s the perfect person for this point in time. Bill was the only salesperson doing these OEM deals. Now they\\'re dealing with IBM. They\\'re entering the enterprise world. This needs to be a real business.\\n\\nBack to the IBM negotiations, obviously Microsoft is very interested. IBM is not just very interested in working with Microsoft. They have to work with Microsoft. They\\'re the only game in town.\\n\\nBen: Specifically, they asked Microsoft for programming languages. They\\'re like, we\\'re making this great PC, we\\'re going to need a BASIC. We think you guys are working on a COBOL. We\\'d like some COBOL.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, Fortran. Give us the whole thing. There\\'s some debate on whether it was the Microsoft side or the IBM side that really saw the vision of, hey, the 16-bit generation is going to enable real business software use cases on the personal computer, but it doesn\\'t matter. That\\'s the plan here, and that is absolutely what happens.\\n\\nThese initial discussions are for the programming language. Microsoft doesn\\'t make an operating system at this point, because in the 8-bit generation, the operating system, I think, was a glorified bootloader to just get into the programming environment so that you could either write or load up the BASIC programs that Microsoft was going to interpret and then run.\\n\\nIn the 8-bit generation, most, if not all hardware providers of microcomputers just wrote their own operating systems. It just wasn\\'t a big deal. Now, there was one off-the-shelf operating system out there from a company called Digital Research, which was run by Gary Kildall, who, I think as we talked about earlier, Bill and Paul had actually intersected with back in Seattle.\\n\\nBen: Yup. I think they were reasonably friendly.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I think they were quite friendly because they partnered. You needed the operating system to get into the programming environment. It wasn\\'t that big of a deal. Whenever anybody needed one off-the-shelf, Bill and Microsoft would just refer people over to Digital to get it.\\n\\nBen: Yup. CP/M, right?\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. CP/M, which I think is maybe Control Program for Microprocessors, I think, is the abbreviation there.\\n\\nBen: God, they were so bad. Every single thing that\\'s been named to this point, except for the company Microsoft, was a horrible name. The processor is 8008, and now it\\'s 8080, but the machine is 8800, that the processor is inside. Give me a break, everyone. It\\'s horrible naming.\\n\\nDavid: Bill and I\\'m sure Paul too, but Bill is the only person in this industry that has the vision for what this can become, even Intel. Bill talks about this. He doesn\\'t think that Intel even realizes what\\'s happening here. They\\'re just like, oh, we\\'re just making more chips, and people use them for stuff.\\n\\nBen: It does seem like very few people are thinking about their products as something they really need to build a brand around with consumers, hence the naming schemes.\\n\\nDavid: The IBM, Microsoft discussions are going along. IBM\\'s like, oh, hey, yeah, we need an operating system. Bill, I think from everything we\\'ve read and folks we\\'ve talked to, in good faith just does the standard thing he\\'s always done in these situations. He\\'s like, oh yeah, go talk to Gary, go talk to Digital Research. He can probably do that.\\n\\nBen: Right. We don\\'t have an operating system, this guy does.\\n\\nDavid: What happens next is unclear. But what is clear is however it goes down, this is one of, if not the biggest business blunder in history. IBM, that team from Project Chess, flies down, I think, directly from Seattle and talking with Bill and Steve to Monterey, California, where Digital Research is based at this point, to meet with Gary and his wife, Dorothy, who run the business together. Bill\\'s called them. He\\'s like, hey, I got a big OEM client coming down, needs an operating system.\\n\\nBen: He signed hefty, hefty NDAs. He cannot say who it is, but he\\'s like, you really should take this seriously.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The team comes down. Obviously, they show up there from IBM. There\\'s a big snafu where Gary does not attend the meeting. There are conflicting reports about what happened.\\n\\nBen: Was it one of them that he\\'s out flying an airplane?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I\\'m pretty sure he was flying his personal airplane while this happens. Some reports are he was just out joyriding and missed it. Some reports are no, he was on a business trip, knew it was happening, but he had another important business meeting. He didn\\'t know that this was IBM that was coming. Regardless, it doesn\\'t really matter because IBM just wants the operating system.\\n\\nDorothy does meet with them. She\\'s unwilling to sign their NDA. There\\'s a lawyer from Digital Research who gets involved, and he doesn\\'t really understand what\\'s going on.\\n\\nThe punchline is that IBM leaves this interaction with the belief that Gary and Digital Research aren\\'t up for working with them and aren\\'t capable of producing here. Producing is important because it\\'s not like the existing CP/M OS that they made would work here. They would have to write a new version, a 16-bit version, and they hadn\\'t done that yet.\\n\\nBen: In particular, they would have to do some customizing. But part of what IBM wants is a customized version of an operating system for the IBM PC. They don\\'t want this to be fully off-the-shelf.\\n\\nJust to add one more stir the pot of history here, there is another version of this story where Gary does actually have a conversation with IBM, and it blows up over licensing terms. What Gary really wants is a significant royalty of every IBM PC sold, and IBM walks over that. Whether that happened or whether it\\'s just an NDA issue, either way, I think we all know the IBM PC did not end up running the CP/M operating system.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s amazing. I didn\\'t know that. We\\'ll talk about that when we get to the business terms of the Microsoft IBM deal in a minute. But for the moment, there\\'s no deal yet because an operating system needs to be provided here.\\n\\nIBM goes back to Microsoft and they\\'re like, hey, this guy you referred us to ain\\'t going to work. The way that I read some quotes from the IBM people here were like, we just threw the problem back in Microsoft\\'s lap of you guys deal with this, you source an operating system.\\n\\nI\\'d like to say that Bill, Steve, and Microsoft, you don\\'t need to give them an opportunity twice. In this case, you did need to give them an opportunity twice because they almost flubbed it and sent IBM down to see Gary. This time they don\\'t flub it. They\\'re like, okay, we\\'ll get you an operating system.\\n\\nBen: Enter Seattle Computer Products.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. It just so happens that right down the road from Microsoft in the Seattle area—I think despite being named Seattle Computer Products, I think this company was actually based in Tukwila, Washington—a programmer named Tim Patterson had just written a 16-bit operating system for the 8086 that Intel had just announced, and he was calling it the Quick and Dirty 16-bit Operating System or QDOS for short, and had it ready to go.\\n\\nWhy had he written this? What was this company, Seattle Computer Products? Why did they have an operating system? They were a component provider to microcomputer manufacturers. They essentially made motherboards. When Intel now has announced this new 16-bit processor generation that they\\'re coming out with, Seattle Computer Products want to sell motherboards and have them ready for 16-bit.\\n\\nThey need to test and play around with these things, and their customers are asking for it. They had been going to Kildall and Digital Research too and badgering them to like, hey, write the 16-bit version of CP/M. Gary just didn\\'t, so Tim\\'s like, fine, I\\'ll do a quick and dirty version myself, and thus DOS is born.\\n\\nBen: Incredible, which of course later, they would drop the Q and call it DOS, the Disk Operating System. Something about dirty didn\\'t have a ring to it when you\\'re selling it to IBM.\\n\\nDavid: No. Bill, Paul, and Microsoft have learned about this. They know Seattle Computer Products, they know Rod Brock, the guy who owns the company. They get in touch with him and they say, hey, can we license QDOS from you and Tim? We\\'ve got a big OEM customer that wants a 16-bit operating system. They work out a deal whereby Microsoft pays Seattle Computer Products $25,000 for the rights to adapt and sell QDOS to the one unnamed original equipment manufacturer who they\\'re working with.\\n\\nTim, actually, is jazzed about this. He ends up leaving SCP computer products and joining Microsoft. With the rest of the team, he\\'s part of building DOS, taking his initial work and turning it into real DOS. Later on, before this all gets announced and the PC ships, Microsoft would pay Seattle computer products another $50,000 for full rights to own 86 QDOS, sell and license it to anybody else indefinitely. I believe the total amount of dollars that changed hands here is $75,000.\\n\\nBen: Unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: This is DOS. One programmer wrote a \"quick and dirty\" operating system, and Microsoft bought the license to that and adapted it into DOS. Tim, when he was at Seattle computer products, definitely did not write DOS as DOS. It\\'s not like Microsoft bought all of DOS for $75,000. They did a lot of work on it, but this is how it all goes down.\\n\\nBen: Microsoft would eventually generate billions of dollars on DOS-based products. You\\'re exactly right in the same way that Instagram today is a much different code base than Instagram and much larger code base than Instagram when it was purchased, but my God, $75,000 to buy DOS to get this whole thing started. Until Windows 95, all of the Windows operating systems were DOS-based.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s just crazy. It really illustrates how fast things were moving, how much all this was getting invented and discovered in real time that even to this point, Bill Gates isn\\'t thinking that operating systems are that important. This is just a shortcut to get the deal done with IBM to make it happen.\\n\\nBen: Also, David, I got to say, I just looked it up. The address of Seattle Computer Products, on the original business card for Seattle Computer Products where I presume QDOS was written, the space is available, so I know where our next studio needs to be.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s in Tequila?\\n\\nBen: It\\'s in Tequila.\\n\\nDavid: All right. The rent can\\'t be that expensive then, so let\\'s do it.\\n\\nBen: Correct.\\n\\nDavid: Hell, yeah. We\\'ve been joking for years about making the Acquired Museum. We might have a location.\\n\\nOkay. Now they\\'ve got the operating system, they\\'ve got QDOS or DOS in place to license the IBM. The only thing that is left to formalize the partnership is the business terms.\\n\\nBen, if what you said is right about the Gary Kildall IBM negotiations, this is just a master stroke from Bill here in the licensing with IBM, because there are two really, really big levers that it looks like Bill is giving big time on one of them, but he is winning big time on the other one.\\n\\nBen: What are they?\\n\\nDavid: The one that it looks like he\\'s giving on is he does another fixed cost OEM deal with IBM.\\n\\nBen: This is in Paul Allen\\'s memoir. IBM paid Microsoft $75,000 for testing and consultation, $45,000 for DOS, and $310,000 for an array of 16-bit language interpreters and compilers. All told, bundled together, that is $430,000 fixed that IBM paid Microsoft with no ongoing obligation.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. No per copy royalties. Every copy of DOS that IBM sells is either included as part of systems that they\\'re selling, or they\\'re free to charge independently for DOS, whatever amount they want, Microsoft gets $0. If it\\'s true that this is where things fell apart with Gary Kildall, crazy that Bill is willing to do this.\\n\\nBen: You might say, what? Didn\\'t Bill learn his lesson? Why would he ever agree to this?\\n\\nDavid: On the one hand, this is what he was doing with Apple and others. He was doing these fixed cost deals. He would think, man, IBM, this is the time. People aren\\'t going to pirate IBM software. Now\\'s the time to really grab the money bags.\\n\\nBen: But Bill saw something that no one else did.\\n\\nDavid: I don\\'t know if it was directly in exchange in the negotiations, but the other lever that he saw, that he pulled was Microsoft retained the rights to own DOS and to own their languages and license it and them to anyone else they wanted at any price on any terms.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s so interesting, because what ended up happening that Bill Gates masterminded was once we distribute our operating system through IBM\\'s PC, that\\'s going to become the thing everyone buys. Now, in the 16-bit generation, when there are people building programs for computers, not just developers, once those application developers who are writing programs are targeting an operating system, then that is the operating system that every other OEM, every other computer maker is also going to want and really need, and we\\'re going to be the ones that they have to come to to buy it.\\n\\nI can\\'t figure out, did IBM miss this fact? Or did they know it? Basically, what IBM did was they were the one place where every business needed to go for their computer needs. What they did in this negotiation was they actually handed that over to Microsoft. They said, we are going to become a commodity, just like every other hardware manufacturer, and you are going to be the point of integration for the whole ecosystem. You\\'re going to be the linchpin that everyone has to target for their applications.\\n\\nDavid: I think there are two things going on here, one small and one big. The small thing is actually related all the way back to the beginning of the episode, what you said, Ben, about the antitrust concerns within IBM. To hear them say it, they actually didn\\'t want ownership of the software. They wanted it to be separate because it would look better.\\n\\nBen: Because then they have the plausible deniability of, how could we possibly have a monopoly? We\\'re buying off-the-shelf...\\n\\nDavid: Part of an ecosystem, blah-blah-blah. Yeah.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. From a vendor who can sell to anybody else. We have no lock in.\\n\\nDavid: That may well be true. I think the bigger thing that just wasn\\'t in their consideration or mindset was they (I think) assumed that once they entered the PC market, IBM was going to be the dominant player, so it didn\\'t matter. Once IBM is selling PCs, who\\'s going to buy a PC from anybody else? IBM is going to win this market.\\n\\nBen: Just like they have in every other line of business they\\'ve been in.\\n\\nDavid: What Bill saw was he really made a bet that the same dynamics that played out with the Altair were also going to play out with the IBM PC. There would be a million hardware manufacturers, flowers blooming here.\\n\\nBen: Building to the same spec.\\n\\nDavid: Building to the same spec.\\n\\nBen: Using the same processor.\\n\\nDavid: Which of course, they could because it was all off-the-shelf components. IBM either didn\\'t see or didn\\'t believe that that would actually happen.\\n\\nBen: IBM failed to see the value of software, and they certainly failed to understand what a software platform business model would be.\\n\\nDavid: Which makes sense. Why would they? They are the computing company.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Their experience in selling mainframes with everything bundled in was the wrong experience to go off of in understanding the way the future would unfold. Bill\\'s very modest experience watching the Altair and all these Altair clone type machines, or even if they\\'re not Altair clones, just more microcomputers that need more software, actually was the useful experience to pattern match off of of what does the world of microcomputers look like, and how is that fundamentally different than the world of mainframes.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. In a way that the mini computer generation, like we\\'ve been saying, it was like a half generation. It wasn\\'t actually fundamentally that different other than DEC gained a foothold.\\n\\nBen: The deal that Bill Gates made with IBM for the IBM PC is the greatest deal in at least computer industry history, if not all business history, full stop.\\n\\nDavid: Let\\'s say a little bit about why. It\\'s obvious, but here now is IBM, most valuable company in the world. They\\'re going to come out with the PC platform. They are going to build the market. Microsoft is going to own the linchpin, in Hamilton Helmer terms, where the power is in the market, and they\\'re going to be free to license it at whatever terms they want to any other player who wants to enter.\\n\\nThey signed this agreement in November 1980. The IBM PC ships in August 1981. Just incredible, almost exactly a little more than a year from the time Project Chess starts to when they actually ship the PC.\\n\\nBen: Truly incredible, they pulled it off.\\n\\nDavid: Truly incredible. It changes the world. That\\'s such a trite thing to say, but everything that everybody\\'s imagining happens.\\n\\nBen: IBM was right that it was by far in a way the most successful personal computer on the market as soon as they released it.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. They sell 13,500 IBM PCs within the first couple of months after they announce it. Over the next two years, they sell half a million of them, makes them unquestionably the largest personal microcomputer manufacturer/market leader. Everybody at IBM is celebrating. The clones haven\\'t arrived yet, and maybe they won\\'t. It\\'ll play out like they think. Not exactly.\\n\\nBefore we talk about the clones, this is really just a footnote because of course all the incentives are aligned for IBM to push DOS as the operating system for the PC. They\\'ve done this whole deal with Microsoft. They have a royalty-free deal with them.\\n\\nWhen they launch the PC, customers actually have a choice of which operating system they want on their IBM PC. They don\\'t have to go with DOS. Consumers can choose between DOS, 16-bit CP/M. By this point in time, Gary and Digital Research have gotten their act together. They\\'ve written a 16-bit version of the CPM operating system. Or another 16-bit operating system called Pascal that came out of the University of California at San Diego.\\n\\nThe price sheet for the operating system option is Pascal is an extra $450 with your IBM PC. CP/M is an extra $175 with your IBM PC, and DOS, which was developed specifically for the PC is the best way to run it is only $60. IBM is making $60 of full 100% margin on top of their hardware for the PC by selling DOS because they don\\'t have to pay Microsoft any of that, and they\\'ve set up the incentives that obviously everybody\\'s going to choose DOS.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s fascinating. And you know what? To give them a little bit more credit too, they did try to enforce that there\\'s some amount of lock-in to the IBM PC. They did that in two ways. One is we\\'re simplifying calling it DOS. It was PC-DOS, which is different than MS-DOS, which would get licensed to other computer makers. I don\\'t know exactly what happened, but it basically seems like it just wasn\\'t different enough to be meaningful to application developers. That\\'s one piece of it.\\n\\nThe second is IBM did actually have proprietary BIOS. That was another part where they thought that that might provide them some protection, where they could stay a linchpin in the ecosystem. It wasn\\'t just all off-the-shelf. They actually did have something that was theirs that was proprietary.\\n\\nDavid: It just turned out that the effort required to reverse engineer the IBM BIOS was trivial, basically.\\n\\nBen: Do you know the story of the Compaq BIOS?\\n\\nDavid: I know the Compaq story, but I don\\'t know the story of the BIOS specifically. Enlighten us.\\n\\nBen: \\u200aIt is basically why Compaq worked is what it comes down to. Compaq was formed basically to clone the IBM PC. They saw the market opportunity, and they realized they could buy from all the same equipment vendors. Let\\'s go eat their margin is basically the plan.\\n\\nHowever, the one thing that was not off-the-shelf is the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), which is effectively the thing that decides to load the operating system when you turn the machine on. There\\'s some proprietary magic that happens to call upon the operating system to do its thing. Compaq reverse engineered the BIOS. The way that they did it was very similar to Trip Hawkins and the story that he told us about his reverse engineering at Electronic Arts.\\n\\nDavid: Of the Psychogenesis.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Compaq had two engineers. One engineer went in and fully dissected the code for the IBM PC BIOS, basically saw all the proprietary calls that it made, and documented each of those calls without writing the implementation steps. Then he handed, hey, here\\'s what the BIOS needs to interface with, over to the other engineer. The other engineer, on their own, just went through and thought of an implementation.\\n\\nThey have no idea if it\\'s the same implementation, so it\\'s not breaking any infringement. They\\'re basically saying, I\\'m just seeing the requirements for this product, and I\\'m coming up with my own implementation of that product. They basically figured out how to exactly clone the IBM PC and buy the very same operating system.\\n\\nTo go back to quoting Ben Thompson because this is from his great piece again, \"The result was a company that came to dominate the market. Compaq was the fastest startup to ever hit $100 million in revenue, then the youngest firm to break into the Fortune 500, then the fastest company to hit $1 billion in revenue, and by 1994, Compaq was the largest PC maker in the world.\"\\n\\nDavid: The Compaq story is amazing. The three people who start Compaq in 1982 are actually Texas Instruments engineers who left, and they wanted to start a company. I believe as the legend goes, they were trying to decide what to start. They were considering a restaurant chain and a bunch of different business ideas. The IBM PC comes out at the end of 1981 and they\\'re like, oh, we can clone this and do everything, the story you just told. It\\'s wild. They start the company in 1982. Within the first year, they do $111 million of revenue of selling IBM PC clone hardware.\\n\\nBen: And is it just cheaper? Basically this is the IBM PC, but for less money?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, exactly. Same thing, cheaper.\\n\\nBen: So begins the race to the bottom of PC hardware. Completely undifferentiated, all the value accrues to the software layer.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Compaq went public the very next year, in 1983 well before Microsoft, which is funny. Compaq, all these other clone companies that get started. Microsoft licenses DOS to all of them importantly, critically, on a per-machine-sold basis. This is when they grab the money. The operating system is so deeply embedded and needs to get shipped with the computer itself.\\n\\nConsumers can go buy operating systems to upgrade and whatnot, but no hardware manufacturer is going to ship a 16-bit PC without an operating system. Piracy is not an issue here. Microsoft can now do a per-copy-sold, per-machine-sold license with all these clones. My God, it\\'s just a geyser of money.\\n\\nBen: Microsoft used IBM to generate demand for their software, and then they used every other PC manufacturer to capture the value that all that demand created.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I think I have these numbers and timeframes right. I believe that for calendar year 1982, Microsoft\\'s revenue was $25 million. I think this must have been when they switched to fiscal year end and June 30th. Microsoft\\'s fiscal year end starting then and up through now is June 30th.\\n\\nThey\\'re fiscal 1984. The year ended June 30th, 1984, so 1983 midpoint to 1984 midpoint. Microsoft does $98 million. In an 18-month period from the end of 1982, they go from $25–$98 million. It\\'s all on the back of the clones. Unlike Compaq that they did $111 million of revenue their first year, they\\'re selling hardware which has serious cogs associated with it. Microsoft, 100% essentially, gross margin, software revenue, more than doubling year on year. It\\'s the best business of all time.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and they combined two magical principles together. This infinite replicability, zero marginal costs of software, and becoming the linchpin of the ecosystem. They are now the software that everyone needs to target, which gives them pricing power. That pricing power raises your top line, and you have no costs. It\\'s unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: Meanwhile, in the computing industry background, while all this is going on with the launch of the IBM PC and then the clones, Apple had gone public at the end of 1980 in I think, the biggest and most successful IPO of all time at that point. Remember we talked about Genentech on the Novo Nordisk episode. They went public right before Apple, and then Apple was bigger. They\\'re valued at $1.8 billion at IPO. Steve Jobs is this multi hundred millionaire, media darling, all this stuff.\\n\\nThe next year in 1981, Microsoft reorganizes from the partnership between Bill and Paul with the handshake deal that Steve\\'s going to be cut in on the partnership into a stock company, a C-corporation. As part of doing that, the venture firm, Technology Venture Investors (TVI) invest $1 million, I believe, for 5% of the company. This is crazy. That\\'s a $20 million post money valuation.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s a 1-on-20 post when Microsoft is doing how much in revenue?\\n\\nDavid: That year, they did $17 million in revenue, and they\\'re about to do the IBM deal. This is absolutely absurd.\\n\\nBen: It says a lot about this period of time that you could do a 1X revenue deal in a high-margin software company. I actually don\\'t think this shows a weakness in Microsoft. Oh, they didn\\'t have leverage or something that. That wasn\\'t it at all, it was just the deals sucked.\\n\\nDavid: Venture capital sucked back then. There\\'s no other way to put it.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s only 5%, so good on Microsoft. Spoiler alert, this is the only dilution that they would ever take. That\\'s also extremely different than today, but a $20 million valuation at this stage is frankly ludicrous.\\n\\nDavid: Even among people who should be in the know, the beauty of the software business model still is something people don\\'t understand.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s exactly right.\\n\\nDavid: The hotness is the hardware. It\\'s like Apple just IPO\\'d. Apple\\'s worth $1.8 billion. Like, ooh, that\\'s the industry, ooh, it\\'s IBM, et cetera. When Microsoft itself would go public a few years later in 1986, they actually go public the same week that they moved to the big campus in Redmond, where they are to this day. Their market cap at IPO is only $750 million despite having done $200 million of very high margin software revenue in the trailing 12 months up to that, growing 100% year over year. It\\'s insane.\\n\\nBen: Hey, that\\'s 4X multiple expansion off the last time they raised money.\\n\\nDavid: Right? It\\'s just crazy that people don\\'t yet appreciate the power.\\n\\nBen: Bill Gates and Warren Buffett did a conversation at the University of Washington in 1998. This is as late as 1998. This thing that we\\'re talking about, the magic of the software business model and how it should be reflected in a company\\'s valuation especially when it\\'s a high-growth company was still not understood even by Bill Gates himself.\\n\\nHere\\'s the quote. Bill Gates says, \"I think the multiples of technology stocks should be quite a bit lower than the multiples of stocks like Coke and Gillette because we are subject to complete changes in the rules. I know very well that in the next 10 years, if Microsoft is still a leader, we will have had to weather at least three crises.\" Bill Gates is essentially making an argument. Granted, this is in the middle of all the antitrust stuff, so he\\'s very prime for this.\\n\\nDavid: And the Internet.\\n\\nBen: And the Internet. He\\'s basically making the argument that disruptive forces come at you so fast in the technology industry that even though you can grow extremely fast, it\\'s this extremely scalable thing, distributing software at zero distribution costs, and even though the margins are unbelievable because you have zero marginal costs, they still shouldn\\'t be valued as highly as a CPG company, which is so different than the way that people think about it today.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s funny. I\\'ve thought about this a lot, and I actually watched that interview years ago. It\\'s so good. There are elements of truth to this too. I think it\\'s that for most technology companies, that is totally true. For a few technology companies that have true power and true scale, the exact opposite is true. Microsoft is still the most valuable company in the world today.\\n\\nBen: Companies that are less susceptible to disruption, more predictable in terms of high growth, high margin revenue deserve a premium. But Gates is basically arguing, everyone else doesn\\'t.\\n\\nLet\\'s flash all the way back to 1981 and talk about this venture capital investment, this 1-on-20 that TVI does.\\n\\nDavid: Good work if you can get a man.\\n\\nBen: How does this come to be? Even a whole year before in the fall of 1980, Dave Marquardt, one of the partners and the founders at TVI, flies up to Seattle not to meet Bill Gates, but to meet Steve Ballmer.\\n\\nDavid: Because they were classmates at GSB, right?\\n\\nBen: They weren\\'t quite classmates, but because I think they were two years apart, so they didn\\'t overlap, but they had some of the same social circles. Steve was effectively the screener for anyone who wanted to come and talk to Bill and try and invest in the business.\\n\\nTA Associates had been up, Sutter Hill had been up, Hambrick and Quist had been up, Xerox Ventures, and all of them only ever got to meet with Steve Ballmer and never got passed on to Bill Gates. Steve would basically just bounce them off. I know all this because there\\'s a great oral history from the Computer History Museum, where this whole thing\\'s in a transcript with an interview with Dave Marquardt recalling the whole thing.\\n\\nDave flies up to meet with Steve. Steve says, you\\'re asking really interesting questions. You\\'re thinking about our strategy the right way. You don\\'t just want to do a transactional deal. You really think this is something special. Why don\\'t you meet with Bill? Bill, of course, doesn\\'t have any extra time in his schedule. He says, but I am going to the U-Dub Arizona football game at Husky stadium. Why don\\'t you come and talk to me there?\\n\\nOf course they go, Bill doesn\\'t pay attention to the game at all. He\\'s just laying out the strategy, grilling Dave, and talking about software the whole time. This is fall of 1980. That\\'s a whole year before the deal gets done. Dave\\'s remarking at this point in 1980, they\\'re doing $5 million in revenue, $2–$3 million in profit. They don\\'t need VC money, and yet he was able to get in.\\n\\nHere\\'s the quote. \"I was just helping them out with the business. In the venture business, you\\'re buying and you\\'re selling at the same time. You\\'re trying to figure out, are these guys crazy? Are they ever going to do anything really interesting? If so, how do I get myself positioned to be able to help them do it? So I spent a lot of time up there helping recruit people. I helped to recruit Charles Simonyi, who was an early key guy.\" Charles Simonyi would go on, this is an aside, to write Microsoft Word. Charles was at Xerox PARC inventing the GUI.\\n\\nDavid: We\\'re going to talk about Charles in just a sec.\\n\\nBen: Yes. He says, “And I was working with Steve on business strategy. They had these OEM customers, the PC manufacturers, and they had started to engage with IBM on this operating system. Are we just going to become a low-cost contract programming shop for IBM, an outsourced sweatshop? Or is there some way we can build a business out of this?\\n\\nWhich led to the fixed fee to IBM, the retention of the code, which then we could sell to other people. That\\'s what created the PC industry basically.” That is his recollection of the whole thing, that he was very helpful in this transformative time for the company. At the same time, you have to look at everyone else\\'s incentives.\\n\\nDavid: How can I be helpful, Ben?\\n\\nBen: Dave is only 29 years old, but everyone else is 23. He actually is adult supervision. At the same time, the partnership was still just a partnership, and there was a handshake deal for the equity. If you\\'re Steve Ballmer at this point in history, it would be nice to have a forcing function to actually turn this into a corporation so that we can get some shares granted here. There\\'s a little bit of incentive to say, hey, if we take on an outside investor, we\\'re going to have to restructure.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s what I had always read about the TVI investment. Obviously, Microsoft didn\\'t need the money. They like Dave, but also a big part of it was this was a catalyzing function to do the conversion into a C-corp.\\n\\nBen: Yes. This would create a little bit of board and governance, so it\\'s not just Bill all the time. Bill, of course, I think is still the controlling shareholder just by the amount of stock that he owns. But there\\'s a board. It\\'s Bill, it\\'s Dave, and it\\'s Kay Nishi. It\\'s a three-person board.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, we should say-to-vis a vis Paul, tragically, and I believe it was 1982-1983, he\\'s diagnosed with Hodgkin\\'s disease. He ends up taking a leave and then fully leaving the company. I think he did go on and off the board at various points in time.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true.\\n\\nDavid: But he\\'s no longer a full-time member of the company after his diagnosis.\\n\\nBen: Yup. On this venture investment, it\\'s pretty fascinating. None of these are terribly compelling reasons other than, I guess, it would be nice to have a little bit of capital associated with us formalizing the corporation, but they don\\'t need money at all. They\\'re printing cash. They\\'ve been printing cash ever since that one tight period in Albuquerque. Dave charmed them. I think that\\'s the answer.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'ve always heard wonderful, wonderful things about Dave, and I think everybody really did love him and see his value. But man, to be a venture capitalist in the 1980s and 1990s, oh, man, you couldn\\'t lose.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s pretty crazy. I think part of it too had to do with the fact that Microsoft was up in Seattle. The VCs just weren\\'t traveling. Dave was young and he was single.\\n\\nDavid: Don Valentine famously had the rule. They didn\\'t invest in any company that you couldn\\'t bicycle to from Sand Hill Road.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s crazy. Dave Marquardt, I think most weekends, is flying up to Seattle to hang out with Bill and Steve. It was a real sell. He says, I was young, I was single, I had nothing better to do, and it was really fun and intellectually interesting, so I did it. That resulted in, depending how long TVI held, one of, if not the best venture capital return in history.\\n\\nDavid: Hard to argue with that one. Okay, back to the story. There are a couple more really, really key things that happened in the PC era. Particularly now, once we\\'re into the IBM PC era and the clones, the 16-bit era. Let\\'s start with applications.\\n\\nLike we\\'ve been saying all along, the 8-bit era, applications, package software aren\\'t really a thing. In 1979, at the tail end of the 8-bit era, two programs come out for the Apple II, VisiCalc and WordStar. VisiCalc is the first software spreadsheet application, and WordStar is a word processor. These applications by today\\'s standards are super simple, stone age–type stuff, but they\\'re the first of their kind, particularly VisiCalc and the spreadsheet. They established the potential for business applications on personal computers.\\n\\nThere\\'s a joke at one point in the industry that the Apple II was a \"VisiCalc\" accessory for small businesses. I think that is part of what IBM is seeing and why they\\'re deciding to now get into the industry with the personal computer. Around this time, Microsoft starts the \"Consumer Products Division\" to compete and make application software themselves.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s quite telling it\\'s called the Consumer Products Division to make applications. Even though they\\'re competing to make these applications that today we would view as business tools, spreadsheets, and word processing, that is not how they referred to it.\\n\\nDavid: Right. One of the first people that they hire into this new division to get it going is an engineer, Ben, who you referenced just a minute ago, named Charles Simonyi. They poach Charles, perhaps with Dave Marquardt\\'s help, away from the legendary Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC). I think this is one of the great misconceptions in technology history. Hopefully we can set the record straight a little bit here.\\n\\nBen: Yes. If you ask anybody in our ecosystem, save for the 1% of people who actually know this, what happened at Xerox PARC? They will tell you they invented the mouse, they invented the graphical user interface, and then Steve Jobs walked in, he saw it all, and he said, oh, my God, we have to have it. He went off and he made the Lisa, which had a graphical user interface and a mouse. That failed, but what succeeded was the Macintosh, and it\\'s a wholesale ripoff of Xerox PARC that lives on today in Apple. That is the story that you will hear from basically everyone.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'ve heard it characterized as something like Xerox hosted a picnic in Silicon Valley, and Steve Jobs attended and dined lavishly at the feast.\\n\\nBen: All of this is true.\\n\\nDavid: Which is true. That is true. All of that is true.\\n\\nBen: But it\\'s half the story.\\n\\nDavid: He was not the only person who dined lavishly at the feast. Microsoft did just as much directly from Xerox, and Charles was one of the main vectors by which this happened.\\n\\nHere is the list of things that were invented or basically invented at Xerox PARC. The graphical user interface, the desktop, the mouse, object-oriented programming, ethernet, laser printing, along with a whole host of other things. This is everything about modern computing, invented there.\\n\\nWho are the people who were at Xerox PARC? There was Alan Kay, there was Bob Metcalfe, who would go on to found 3Com. He invented ethernet, Metcalfe\\'s Law.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, the value of a network scaling proportionally to the square of the number of inputs.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Bob Metcalf, Xerox PARC, Larry Tesler, who would join Apple, John Warnock, who started Adobe, Eric Schmidt worked at Xerox PARC. Everybody was there. It was a lavish picnic.\\n\\nBen: And Charles Simonyi.\\n\\nDavid: And Charles Simonyi. The thing about PARC and the computer that they built there to instantiate all these concepts, which was named the Alto, is it really was a research center. The Alto, go look it up on Wikipedia, go look at pictures. It\\'s the Mac. The Alto is the Mac.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s the Mac with the monitor turned on its side.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, it\\'s a vertical Mac.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s a 3x4 display, not a 4x3 display.\\n\\nDavid: They start making it in 1973. You might be like, wait a minute, what\\'s going on here? The Mac doesn\\'t come out till 1984.\\n\\nBen: 11 years earlier.\\n\\nDavid: How on earth is Xerox making the Mac in the pre 8-bit era, the pre-microprocessor era? It\\'s not a microprocessor. The Alto is not a microprocessor architecture. It\\'s a mini computer. What you see when you look at photos of the Alto is you see the Mac. What you don\\'t see is under the table or behind it is a mini computer.\\n\\nBen: I never realized that.\\n\\nDavid: It is not a personal computer architecture at all. It is a 16-bit, essentially mini computer, that costs tens of thousands of dollars to make each one of them. It\\'s a science project.\\n\\nBen: You should have a little bit more generosity for the East Coast management at Xerox for failing to commercialize this.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. The time was not right. It was not possible. It wasn\\'t even conceived of in the microprocessor architecture, because the microprocessor basically didn\\'t exist when they made it.\\n\\nBen: Interesting.\\n\\nDavid: In 1980, again, this year for Microsoft, same year Microsoft joins, same year they signed the IBM partnership, Charles Simonyi comes up from Xerox PARC. He\\'s of course bringing all this same knowledge, all this same experience that Steve jobs is bringing into Apple. He\\'s bringing all that right into Microsoft too.\\n\\nThe first thing that he gets tasked with is working with this new consumer products division to build application software to compete with VisiCalc and WordStar to compete with spreadsheets and to compete in word processing. He leads the teams that create Word and MultiPlan, Microsoft\\'s first spreadsheet. Remember, we\\'re still at the end of the 8-bit era. The graphical user interface doesn\\'t exist yet other than on the Alto in Xerox PARC.\\n\\nBen: No, these are DOS applications. It\\'s all character mode.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, it is command line interface. The vector that they think they\\'re going to compete, at least in spreadsheets with VisiCalc, is that they\\'re going to be on every platform out there. VisiCalc, I believe, was more or less basically only on the Apple II. That doesn\\'t end up working too well.\\n\\nThe next generation, the IBM PC era, they make the same mistake. The application business stays focused on being on lots of machines, making software that\\'s compatible with everything. A new company pops up called Lotus. Lotus makes the radical decision that they are going to make a spreadsheet only for the IBM PC.\\n\\nThis was genius. This is the 1-2-3 spreadsheet. It goes on to become, at that point in time, the most successful software ever. This is wild. I can\\'t even believe I\\'m about to say this, and it blew my mind when I found it in research. There are a couple of years in the late eighties, where Lotus has more revenue than Microsoft and is valued higher.\\n\\nBen: Yup. In fact, the year that Microsoft went public, Lotus had more revenue than Microsoft at the IPO.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Wild.\\n\\nBen: it\\'s crazy. Lotus 1-2-3 had some graphics, but it was still in character mode. It was a powerful spreadsheet that could start to do some graphics, even though there wasn\\'t actually a GUI operating system yet, which is interesting. Lotus 1-2-3 was faster, it had bigger spreadsheets, and it was just more powerful. Microsoft Multiplan was still targeting the older 8-bit.\\n\\nMultiplan, despite Microsoft\\'s best efforts, is completely left in the dust. Microsoft\\'s trying to figure out, what should we learn from this? In talking with Pete Higgins and Mike Slade, who were both early leaders in the development and the marketing of the applications division, actually, Mike Slade went on to work directly for Steve Jobs at NeXT and Apple for many years.\\n\\nIn chatting with both of them, what basically became apparent Microsoft learned, with our applications, we should not be targeting the current platforms at all. The lesson to learn is never leave yourself open to the next generation of technology. They\\'re learning the Moore\\'s Law lesson again.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and how it applies to applications. Yes. You always got to target the next platform.\\n\\nBen: Right, even if that platform is not the one you own. That\\'s the interesting thing about when they\\'re evaluating Multiplan and they say, how do we not get Lotus 1-2-3 again, basically, the applications team gets the freedom to look around and say, okay, no matter what our overall company strategy is right now, or no matter what the systems division is doing, what is the most cutting-edge platform that is going to be so interesting to people that we can develop the most envelope-pushing technology for it? That becomes the mandate for applications.\\n\\nDavid: This is the dawn of horizontal software. You can have a whole company or a whole division of a company, in Microsoft\\'s case, that makes this tool. That tool will be so much better than anything that even the largest companies can have their own software developers write. General Electric isn\\'t going to write a better spreadsheet than 1-2-3. I think that the technology complement to this law is the killer app.\\n\\nBen: You have to counter position. If 1-2-3 is the best spreadsheet out there for the current technology generation, you just can\\'t compete with them. You need to wait for the next big leap forward in order to find a new competitive vector.\\n\\nDavid: You need to be the killer app on the next platform, and that\\'s what Lotus 1-2-3 did with the spreadsheet on the IBM PC and IBM compatible PC. That\\'s what Microsoft decides, hey, we got to do this in the graphical interface.\\n\\nBen: Who\\'s about to come out with the very best instantiation of a graphical user interface? Apple computer.\\n\\nDavid: That would be Steve Jobs.\\n\\nBen: Yes. The next chapter of our Microsoft story is the Macintosh in 1984.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s so fun.\\n\\nBen: Before we do that, this is the perfect time to talk about another one of our favorite companies and longtime Acquired partners who are back, pilot.com. For startups and growth companies of all kinds, Pilot handles all of your company\\'s accounting, tax, and bookkeeping needs, and is in fact now by far the largest startup focused accounting firm in the entire US.\\n\\nDavid: Also, we have to give our good buddy and Pilot CEO, Waseem Daher, a special shout out here because I think he is now the only Acquired sponsor CEO, who is also a source for an episode, because back when Waseem was a student at MIT, he interviewed Bill Gates for the school paper. He dug up the PDF and sent it to us. We\\'re going to link to it in the episode sources.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Very fun. Back to Pilot, and speaking of incredibly successful Seattle business people, we talk all the time on Acquired about Jeff Bezos\\' AWS-inspired axiom that startups should focus on what makes their beer taste better, i.e. only spend your limited time and resources on what is actually going to move the needle for you, your product, your customers, and outsource everything else that you need to do as a company but doesn\\'t fit that bill.\\n\\nAccounting is example number one of what he\\'s talking about. Every company needs this, but it needs to be done by a professional. You don\\'t want to take any risk of something going wrong. But at the same time, it actually has zero impact on your product or your customers.\\n\\nDavid: So enter Pilot. Pilot both sets up and operates your company\\'s entire financial stack, finance, accounting, tax, even CFO services like investor reporting from your general ledger, all the way up to budgeting and financial sections of your board decks. They\\'ve been doing this now for years across thousands of startups in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. There\\'s nobody better who you can trust to both get finance right and make it easy and painless for your company.\\n\\nBen: These are now companies like OpenAI, Airtable, Scale, as well as large ecommerce companies. It\\'s not just that they have the experience across startups, they can also keep working with you as you scale to the growth phase and beyond. If your company wants to go back to focusing on what makes your beer taste better, go on over to pilot.com/acquired and tell them that Ben and David sent you.\\n\\nAll right, David, why are we talking about the Mac?\\n\\nDavid: Because I think it\\'s fair to say that the Mac made Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Office made the Mac. I don\\'t think that it\\'s actually a controversial statement, although it probably sounds crazy to many of you listening.\\n\\nBen: Totally. Far and away the first thing to point out is the first version of Microsoft Excel was for the Mac. It\\'s especially crazy for all the finance people today who are like, oh, Mac Excel isn\\'t real Excel. Excel has to happen on Windows.\\n\\nDavid: No, Excel was on the Mac. That was it.\\n\\nBen: Yes. The logic basically was Microsoft was really coming around to the idea that the next big thing in computing was the graphical user interface. The reason they were coming around to this was because they knew from Xerox PARC just as well as Apple did, and they were rapidly trying to figure out how to get All of that Xerox PARC-iness into their product line, too. That\\'s the other half of this untold Xerox PARC story.\\n\\nOne of the first ways that they see to bring the graphical user interface to their products is launching Excel for the Mac because they basically see, the way that we got destroyed with Lotus 1-2-3, we can\\'t compete with lotus on the IBM PC, so we\\'re going to shelf Multiplan start over, and Excel is going to come out in the graphical user interface. We\\'re going to try to be first and best on the GUI.\\n\\nDavid: One thing just to underscore here, Excel is the world\\'s first graphical spreadsheet program. That\\'s why it wins, and that\\'s why it\\'s so important. Imagine trying to use Excel in the command line interface. That\\'s what VisiCalc was, that\\'s what even 1-2-3 was. Yeah, useful, better than nothing, but graphical charts, cells, visual relationships, this is so important. Excel is where it all starts.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Of course, Apple loves this. The Macintosh came out in 1984, and everybody remembers the great intro video and the hello script. I\\'ve watched that Steve Jobs keynote because of course, I have, and it\\'s this magical moment in computing history where finally something that\\'s insanely great comes out. It\\'s the beginning of Steve Jobs\\' unbelievable presentation prowess. It\\'s so fun to watch it. It\\'s, of course, a product that eventually people really loved. But at first...\\n\\nDavid: It doesn\\'t have the killer app.\\n\\nBen: No, it\\'s a product that was supposed to ship in 1982. It didn\\'t, it shipped in 1984. At the time, what they were targeting for 1982 was a pretty great set of technologies. By 1984, it\\'s an aging set of technologies. It debuts with 128K of memory, which basically isn\\'t enough to create any interesting applications. Developers are ignoring it as an interesting platform to develop on. Within 12 months, they figure it out and come out with a better version that\\'s 512K. That\\'s the version that people now really think about.\\n\\nDavid: That gets re-christened as like, that\\'s the original Mac. The original original is the Mac 128 or something that.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. But in the meantime, Microsoft, the applications group is working their ass off to make something really great for the Macintosh, and they come up with Excel. What ends up happening is Apple\\'s really trying to promote the sales of this machine. They view Excel and PageMaker as the killer apps, as reasons that people should buy this thing, because once you run through a lot of the demo apps and the stuff that Apple built, you\\'re like, okay, what else is here? It\\'s crickets.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Writing hello in script is cool, but like a lot of VR stuff, you\\'re like, oh, that\\'s a cool demo, but you\\'re going to do that every day? No.\\n\\nBen: I\\'m not sure this has ever been publicly disclosed before, but Apple spent just as much marketing Excel as Microsoft did. They matched Microsoft\\'s marketing spend with their own campaign for it and split the bill.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s amazing.\\n\\nBen: You\\'ve got a couple of concurrent things going on in applications land. You\\'ve got Excel coming out for Mac to take advantage of the GUI. This strategy is just all over the place, I think that\\'s an interesting thing to underscore about Microsoft in this era. They\\'re trying a ton of stuff because they\\'re paranoid. They don\\'t want to miss the next wave. Meanwhile, also in the applications group, Charles Simonyi has written Word. This is about a year before in 1983. Microsoft Word comes out for DOS.\\n\\nDavid: Right, and they ship it with a mouse.\\n\\nBen: Yes. This is like, okay, we see the Xerox PARC stuff coming out in the Mac. Great, Excel will be for that. We want to develop Word. We\\'re going to do that for DOS. But I can imagine how useful the mouse is going to be in a word processing environment. They actually ship a mouse tied to the application that\\'s not a part of DOS. This is how early we were in figuring out what the split between applications and platforms were at this point in history. Microsoft thought maybe a mouse makes sense just for this one application, even though it doesn\\'t do anything else for the rest of the command line interface.\\n\\nDavid: It was all being figured out. I think it is also really fair to say that Microsoft was right there with Apple in the Mac development phase. Obviously, they\\'re working on Excel, working on other what would become the Office Suite applications together for Mac.\\n\\nSteve Jobs shows Bill Gates the Mac project in 1981, three years before it ships. Microsoft and Apple signed an agreement to work together on applications for it in 1982. They were very deeply embedded on this, which is going to make the lawsuit and what comes up in a minute here all the more funny.\\n\\nBen: The decision for the Excel team is to focus on GUI. The whole marketing message is Excel on a Mac is better than Lotus 1-2-3 on a PC. You\\'re starting to see truly divergent cultures at Microsoft between the systems group, which is currently making DOS.\\n\\nWe\\'ll soon make Windows, soon partner with IBM, or soon do something else that we\\'re getting into here in the next chapter of the story, and the applications group, which is also currently a bunch of disparate applications and teams targeting disparate platforms, but is also about to become unified in their next chapter. Within the applications group, that next chapter is Microsoft Office.\\n\\nIn 1985, in January, the bundle is released. It was originally called the Business Pack for Microsoft. It started on the Mac.\\n\\nDavid: It really rolls off the tongue.\\n\\nBen: Totally does. They haven\\'t acquired PowerPoint yet or forethought as we talked about eight years ago on Acquired way back in history. There\\'s no PowerPoint, it\\'s not part of the bundle. What you\\'ve got here on the Mac and the first version of Office is Word, which they\\'ve developed in house, File, Chart, and Multiplan. This first notion of a suite, so today we\\'re very familiar with suite—Creative Suite over at Adobe. Software is sold this way. This was the first time.\\n\\nWhat was actually happening is all of the bundling was happening in pricing, in marketing, and in manufacturing. You had a single box that they would ship with the different applications by 1988 or 1989. It was Word, Excel, PowerPoint. They\\'re very different things, but they\\'re getting bundled together in a way to be sold to customers, but there\\'s no product integration.\\n\\nYou don\\'t have the ability to do this very nice copy-paste from an Excel table and just paste that into Word. That whole idea is pretty far away. In this earliest Microsoft Office, it was just, how can we bundle something for a cheaper price if you buy all three and make marketing easier for us to have this unified message?\\n\\nDavid: Soon to come—and we\\'ll get into Windows here in a second—one of the big killer app for productivity in particular for business productivity with a graphical user interface like Windows and true multitasking, you can get copy-paste from Excel into PowerPoint. Lotus and the world back in the command line interface where you\\'ve got these programs running on top of DOS, that is a completely foreign concept.\\n\\nBen: Right, none of those verbs exist.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. We\\'ve now set the stage of Microsoft\\'s doing a lot of stuff. They\\'re hedging a lot of bets, they\\'re not totally sure which strategy is going to win out, they\\'re not sure which platform is going to win out. They\\'re not sure if they\\'re more of a systems company or an application company, but what they are unified on is we make great software for personal computers. I think anything that fell into that purview, they were willing to explore.\\n\\nThey didn\\'t really have hard boundaries between, we\\'ll do anything to make our operating systems great, or we\\'ll do anything to advantage our applications. Even we think we\\'re an enterprise company, we think we\\'re a consumer company. They just didn\\'t have well formed opinions yet. It was just we make software for personal computers.\\n\\nDavid: At this point in time, the actual boundary between an operating system and an application is very fluid.\\n\\nBen: You\\'ve got a mouse that works for one program.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Lotus would really go down a dead end evolutionary path with Notes later in its life and its final chapter, where the application was going to be the operating system.\\n\\nBen: Right. Lotus Notes was crazy. It was a word processor, an email service, and it was a platform on which you could write other applications.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and it itself was an application.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Not an operating system. It was all dynamic. Speaking of though, Microsoft here is in bed with Apple, working on the Mac. Bill and the company are big believers in the future of the graphical user interface. Starting in 1983, they\\'re like, we got to do our own graphical operating system or at least user interface. This is the origins of the Windows product. They actually announced it in November, 1983, before the Mac ends up shipping, which their partner, Apple, is of course not happy about.\\n\\nJust development of the Mac was rocky, development of Windows was super freaking rocky within Microsoft, too. This is around that same time when Paul Allen gets Hodgkin\\'s disease and leaves the company. His presence as great technical leader is very much missed, but they bring in someone from Xerox to manage the development of Windows.\\n\\nThat person ends up not working out, he gets fired. Steve Ballmer gets drafted to come in and be the dev manager for the final push to release Windows 1.0, which is hilarious. You can find amazing YouTube videos from the launch and all joking about how non technical Steve coming in to Save the day and dev manage windows to launch.\\n\\nBen: Which is so funny. I don\\'t think at this point in history, the lines were clearly formed among the executives yet. Steve wasn\\'t running the global sales force, and Microsoft wasn\\'t an enterprise company.\\n\\nDavid: No, we\\'re going to get to that later.\\n\\nBen: Steve was one of the smart executives, they were a software company, and someone had to manage getting the software out the door. Windows 1.0 comes out. It\\'s bad.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s bad. November 1985, Windows 1.0 is a very, very different thing than you imagine a graphical user interface is today or what you know of as Windows. It was tiled. It was not overlapping Windows that you can drag around and have one over the other. When you opened a program in Windows 1.0, the system created a literal window of it on your screen, and then it dynamically resized the windows as you open other applications. Nothing could ever be on top of each other. As you open more and more stuff, the windows get smaller and smaller and smaller. It\\'s very bizarre.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. The idea of windows overlapping on top of each other, that was a uniquely Mac thing and a thing that smart engineers at Apple figured out how to do that in a performant way that offers good user experience. I would classify Windows 1.0 as a half step between command line and an actual graphical user interface.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, 100%. I believe Microsoft and Apple actually did a licensing agreement while they were working together during this time that said, hey, Microsoft can use a lot of the stuff that\\'s being developed for Mac for Windows 1.0.\\n\\nBen: Yes, that\\'s right. Apple does do a deal to license a lot of \"their intellectual property\" which of course came from Xerox, to Microsoft. Apple, I think, was under the impression that it was just for Windows 1.0, but the actual terms of the agreement are this and all future versions of Windows, which comes back to haunt Apple later. But yes, they totally get the license.\\n\\nDavid: Also, by the time that this agreement actually happens, I think Steve Jobs has been ousted, so it\\'s Scully who does this agreement. People in Apple would look back on this for years and be like, this was a huge error.\\n\\nThe other important thing about Windows during this awkward teenage phase is it\\'s not an operating system. It\\'s just a graphical interface on top of DOS.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: The original name for Windows was Interface Manager.\\n\\nBen: Isn\\'t it crazy? In all of their early marketing, they referred to it as Windows, a graphical operating environment that runs on the Microsoft MS-DOS operating system. Actually, it was not until Windows 95 that Windows was its own operating system. It was in Windows 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups. It was a graphical operating environment.\\n\\nHere\\'s the question. Why is Microsoft doing Windows? Obviously here, Microsoft knows they need to evolve DOS. They need to figure something out for the graphical world. David, are you telling me that Windows is the widely agreed upon future of the company and that\\'s just a straight line?\\n\\nDavid: Obviously that\\'s a setup there. Here\\'s the other thing that\\'s happening in the company at this time, and it\\'s the bigger thing. It\\'s the next phase of the IBM relationship. Windows, the Mac, all of this, are hedges for the company. Microsoft and Bill, in particular, were masters of hedging their bets in an uncertain technology future.\\n\\nHe was so great. The company was so great at making sure that whichever way the apple fell from the tree, as Jetson Huang put it to us in our interview, Microsoft was going to be positioned to catch it. A lot of people, including Bill and Microsoft themselves, believe that the way that apple was going to fall from the tree here was IBM and OS/2.\\n\\nBen: The IBM PC was such a big deal last time around. You would think that whatever IBM wants to do next is a pretty good way to ally yourself.\\n\\nDavid: What\\'s going on here? IBM, obviously the PC was a huge success, but losing dominance of the ecosystem to the clones, this was bad. IBM wants to find a way to evolve the PC ecosystem back to being more IBM proprietary. They\\'re going to make Microsoft come along for the ride here.\\n\\nThe way that they\\'re going to do this is with the next generation of the PC ecosystem, they are going to make a whole new modern operating system. They\\'re going to get rid of DOS. They\\'re going to make this operating system in partnership with Microsoft, and it\\'s going to be called, fittingly, OS/2. They are going to lock Microsoft up that they can\\'t license it to anybody else. OS/2 is going to be proprietary to IBM hardware, just like the Mac operating system is proprietary to Apple hardware.\\n\\nAs powerful as Microsoft\\'s become here, they\\'re still the little brother to IBM. This is not great news for Microsoft. On the other hand, it\\'s much better for them to be on the inside here with IBM working in bed with them than it would be to be on the outside looking in if IBM\\'s vision comes true and they recapture control of the PC ecosystem.\\n\\nBill, Microsoft, the company, and Steve too as the manager of the account with IBM, commit themselves to Microsoft is all in on this vision of the future of OS/2, and IBM is our horse in the race.\\n\\nBen: This is such a crazy part of the story to me, because we just talked about how Microsoft discovered this amazing business model. With everyone needing to license DOS from them, they\\'re taking over the world, and they\\'re becoming the standard development platform. Why on earth, if all that is true, are they going to develop some software that\\'s going to be locked to IBM computers?\\n\\nDavid: This is a recentralization attempt. Ballmer has this great, great, great quote about it. He says, \"This,” the IBM partnership at this time, “was what we used to call riding the bear. You just had to try to stay on the bear\\'s back and the bear would twist, turn, and try to throw you off. But we were going to stay on the bear because the bear was the biggest, the most important. You just had to be with the bear. Otherwise, you would be under the bear.\" That was IBM at this point in time.\\n\\nReally, I think it was IBM essentially putting a gun to Microsoft\\'s head and being like, well, you can be in bed with us on this future that we\\'re going to re-centralize everything, or you can be everybody else and not be, and you\\'ll lose.\\n\\nBen: Even though Microsoft\\'s doing all these little hedges, Windows, this tiny little team that\\'s 30 people or something, it\\'s not the most prestigious place at the company. The people in the applications division may as well be on another planet by this point from the systems division. They\\'re trying all kinds of crazy stuff. The company motto at this point is the next big thing is OS/2 and IBM, and we are the software vendor for that.\\n\\nDavid: Certainly Bill and I think Steve, too, they needed to tow the party line politically of expressing that, nope, OS/2 is the future. What we\\'re doing with Windows and with the Mac is those are small things within the company. It\\'s a super bizarre period in history, but IBM had also made a bit of a power play too with the later generations of the 16-bit era product they called the PC/AT. They used the Intel 286 chip instead of the Intel 386 chip. The 286 chip—this was an intentional decision on IBM\\'s part—was good, but it wasn\\'t great.\\n\\nBen: You say it was good, but not great. Bill Gates said it was brain dead.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Bill Gates called it a brain-dead chip.\\n\\nBen: I think you might be being charitable.\\n\\nDavid: I think it certainly was more powerful than the 8086, 8088, but it was nowhere near what the 386 could do. There\\'s a bunch of technical aspects to this, but the most important takeaway is that the 286 was not really powerful enough to do a graphical user interface or to power true multitasking in a way that the 386 and then later the 486 would be.\\n\\nA big part of actually the Compaq story about how Compaq and the clones leap ahead of IBM is they\\'re not deterred from coming out with 386 machines, which are way more powerful, can run Windows, can do all this stuff. That\\'s how they start to separate from IBM.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s right. That was a bet that company move where Microsoft was like, hey, Compaq, go make 386 stuff because we\\'re going to make a really great 386 software. We need someone to be all in on that because IBM\\'s not.\\n\\nDavid: This is the thing. Bill, Steve, and the company, they\\'re having to tow the party line of expressing commitment to IBM, but really they\\'re like, no, Compaq, go do the 386, we\\'re going to do Windows.\\n\\nBen: Right, they\\'re riling up the rebels.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. They are the rebels versus the empire here. Anyway, IBM, of course, sees all this. They made the decision not to go to 386 and to discourage it in the marketplace because they didn\\'t want PCs to start creeping into the core enterprise mainframe IBM workloads, their core business. If that was going to happen, they wanted it to be IBM proprietary closed system. I think that was a big part of the impetus for this OS/2 initiative.\\n\\nBen: I see.\\n\\nDavid: This is the empire strikes back here.\\n\\nBen: They\\'re basically trying to coop the PC movement back into IBM proprietary land.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. When OS/2 finally does come out in December 1987, predictably, as you can imagine here, it\\'s not very good. The market does not like it. Thank God for Microsoft. Again, this probably was Bill\\'s strategy all along that they hedged with Windows, with the Mac. That\\'s clearly the future. The market is not going to accept OS/2 and a recentralization on IBM. Microsoft\\'s just crushing it on the revenue side, even though OS/2 is a failure.\\n\\nBen: DOS and the applications were both great businesses by 1987.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Fiscal 1987, Microsoft does $350 million in revenue. Fiscal 1988, they do $600 million in revenue. Basically, none of this is from OS/2 and the IBM world. Towards the end of 1988 is when the wind starts really blowing away from IBM here.\\n\\nIn June of 1988, Microsoft hires Mike Maples, who is IBM\\'s director of software strategy away from IBM to come head Microsoft\\'s application software. What is Microsoft\\'s application software strategy right now? It\\'s the graphical user interface. It\\'s everything that IBM isn\\'t. The writing is starting to be on the wall here that divorce is coming between IBM and Microsoft.\\n\\nFinally, a year-and-a-half later in 1990, Windows 3.0 comes out. This is when they get it right. This is when there\\'s enough installed base of 386 and 486 machines out there in the open PC ecosystem that you can have a really good, true multitasking, good UI, graphical user interface running on top of DOS.\\n\\nWindows 1.0 and Windows 2.0 only ever achieved 5% penetration of the DOS installed base. Windows 3.0 doubles that in the first six months. PC Computing magazine writes about Windows 3.0. May 22nd, 1990 will mark the first day of the second era of IBM compatible PCs. Microsoft released Windows 3.0.\\n\\nOn that day, the IBM compatible PC, a machine hobbled by an outmoded character-based operating system and 70s style programs, was transformed into a computer that could soar in a decade of multitasking graphical operating environments, aka everything OS/2 is not. Windows 3.0 gets right what its predecessors got wrong. It drives adequate performance, it accommodates existing DOS applications, and it makes you believe that it belongs on a PC.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s awesome.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s what the press thought. Ben, I know you talked to a really important person in the Windows ecosystem and Microsoft internally at this time. What do you have for us?\\n\\nBen: We have to thank Brad Silverberg for helping us with this section. Brad led the Windows 3.1 team. He came in right after the 3.0 release and would eventually go on to lead the Windows 95 effort as the VP of the Personal Systems Division.\\n\\nBrad comes in, Windows 3.0 has just shipped. The first thing that is super, super obvious is as Brad observed everything going on with OS/2 land and everything going on with the core Microsoft culture, it was a complete clash. It was impossible for the pace of Microsoft. This is a super young group, all in their 20s. Some people in their 30s, but mostly 20s who just want to push the cutting edge, ship stuff.\\n\\nThink about Google in the early 2000s, just hire all the smartest people you can, set them loose, have creativity, and bump up against the edge of what\\'s possible, both in terms of pushing the hardware, but also pushing even laws as we would later see. Let\\'s just do what users love and see what happens. Let\\'s just do what technology enables us to do and see what happens. That\\'s the opposite of IBM\\'s culture at this point. There\\'s this huge cultural rift between what IBM needs and who Microsoft is at this point.\\n\\nWhat ended up happening with 3.0, it was unexpectedly loved. Microsoft was not really prepared for how much people were going to love the GUI, and with 3.1 it got really good. There was a small off site of the executives, and Bill and Steve basically decided that it was time to bet on Windows. That was the new strategy. Windows had always been plan B, and now suddenly it was plan A.\\n\\nWhen I say plan B, I don\\'t mean thought they had a prayer of being plan A. It was 65 people that shipped windows 3.1. These were the misfits. It was not prestigious. The prestigious thing to work on at Microsoft was OS/2 and eventually Windows NT. But the Windows team in the Windows 3.0 era is almost the Mac team over at Apple. They were flying the rebel flag, they valued creativity over bureaucracy, even if it meant they weren\\'t working on the prestigious thing.\\n\\nSuddenly, there\\'s this huge strategic opportunity to become the standard independent of IBM if the platform is good enough, and then boom. The early reception to Windows is so good, it gives this glimmer of, that may seem really ambitious, but that opportunity is actually ours if we want to go seize it. Everyone took a big gulp and said, the GUI\\'s the next big thing, users love this, let\\'s take the ragtag group and promote them.\\n\\nDavid: This was, I think, the moment when Microsoft started to believe in themselves, really. If you look at the facts as we told the story, it was like, Bill did this great business deal with IBM, anticipated the rise of the clones in the first PC, won, and then Microsoft now was the thing, and IBM was the old thing. It wasn\\'t until this. In this whole OS/2 thing, I think you can see, they felt like they were still little brother. They had to go along with what IBM dictated. Now they\\'re like, whoa.\\n\\nBen: Why do we again?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, we\\'re in control.\\n\\nBen: The press is making a big deal out of Bill Gates. Boy Wonder, he\\'s the youngest ever billionaire at age 31. By the way, when Bill Gates became a billionaire, there were not lots of billionaires, there were 50 billionaires. All this lore around the company, it\\'s like they can do no wrong. But inside the company, I think they\\'re like, we don\\'t know the future of technology. Any wave could break against us at any moment, and this is all tenuous. I think that chasm kept getting wider and wider and wider of internally feeling like they\\'re screwed and externally it\\'s seeming this is the next great thing.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I\\'ve got some fun stats on money and revenue around all this. In fiscal 1990, the year that Windows 3.0 shipped, Microsoft does $1.2 billion in revenue, making them the first software company ever to pass a billion dollars in revenue. Fiscal 1991, they do $1.8 billion. Fiscal 1992, they finally win the Apple copyright lawsuit around the GUI.\\n\\nBen: By the way, the way that they won that, a judge basically looked at the paper and said, Apple, you totally said in all the future versions of Windows, they can use your UI paradigms. For most of the counts, they\\'re covered. For these other things that you\\'re trying to ask them about, those are not actually defensible. It\\'s just widely accepted that these are UI paradigms now, and you can\\'t enforce any ownership over those. It basically got thrown out. Apple tried to appeal all the way up to the Supreme Court, who said no.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s right. Like we\\'ve been saying too, they both stole from Xerox.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Fiscal 1992 though, this is when Microsoft just blows the doors off. They do $2.8 billion in revenue in fiscal 1992, up from $1.8 the year before. That year, 1992 in October is when Gates finally passes John Kluge—Acquired OG fans, back to the LVMH episode—Gates passes John Kluge of Metromedia fame, media mogul to become the wealthiest person in America. Everything you\\'re talking about, all the press comes around that.\\n\\nIn January 1993, the crowning moment happens. Microsoft passes IBM in market cap. They have inherited the earth. They have inherited computing. Supposedly. I don\\'t know if this is 100% true. This is written in one of the books I read. I read this. The folks involved will have to confirm or deny.\\n\\nSupposedly, the next month after Microsoft passes IBM in market cap—we\\'re now in February 1993—the IBM board is in disarray. The empire is going down. They fired the CEO. Tom Murphy of Capital Cities fame who is on the IBM board, supposedly comes out to Redmond to sit down with Bill and personally ask him to come and be the next CEO of IBM.\\n\\nBen: No way.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This is what I read. I don\\'t know if this actually happened, but this is what I read.\\n\\nBen: Is that in Hard Drive?\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s in Hard Drive, yeah.\\n\\nBen: Wow. Listeners, there are some unauthorized biographies that we tried to corroborate as many of the facts as we can. But the ones where David\\'s saying he doesn\\'t know a source, it\\'s these unauthorized ones.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Gates obviously declines that. Whether or not that actually happened, spiritually, you could believe that happened. Bill and Microsoft are the new emperor here. This carries through to this day. We\\'re going to tell in the next episode here, the antitrust, the fall, and all that, but not really. Microsoft\\'s still the most valuable company in the world. They inherited the throne from IBM. It happens right here.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s nuts. Suddenly, Microsoft feels the full weight of everything that you have to do to build a platform and be a steward of an ecosystem. Suddenly, this huge effort began to try and make developers successful. That\\'s how Windows would be successful if it was a great platform for application developers to thrive on.\\n\\nCameron Myhrvold led the developer relations group basically to try and figure out, what do people want out of a platform, and how do we provide the APIs for them, the support, and everything in order to do that, all the documentation, all the help, everything? At the same time, Microsoft basically knew establishing a platform is brutal and requires bootstrapping a multi sided network of developers, users, and PC manufacturers.\\n\\nSo 3.1 had users excited, but it was still very early. They could have lost that throne. Developers were not really yet targeting Windows. Microsoft had to show, we make great applications for Windows, too. The applications group really had to start doing Windows 3.1.\\n\\nDavid: Right, because developers were targeting DOS at this point. They were probably preparing for OS/2. Some of them were targeting the Mac, Microsoft itself, but nobody was targeting Windows.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. You\\'ve got this big developer relations group effort that spins up. Meanwhile, there\\'s a huge push with OEMs to get them to install Windows. At this point, they were still installing DOS or some people were actually installing nothing and requiring users to put operating systems on. There\\'s a conceded push to get the OEMs to install 3.1.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and there are some people installing nothing. We should mention here, around this same time, this era, they move a lot of their OEM deals to a per processor licensing fee arrangement, which gets them in a lot of hot water with antitrust a few years later.\\n\\nBen: Okay, this happened from 1988 to 1994. David, explain the per processor licensing agreement.\\n\\nDavid: Here\\'s how Microsoft (I think) would position it to their OEM partners. You could pay us a license fee for every machine you ship with DOS installed on it, or DOS and Windows. You can offer other OSes too. But rather than that arrangement, we\\'ll give you a cheaper per unit deal because you\\'re going to ship DOS on everything. DOS is the standard, and we want Windows to be the standard, and Windows is going to be the standard.\\n\\nWe\\'ll make it more economically attractive to you, give you a lower per unit rate. If we just change the terms and say, instead of every unit you ship with, DOS or with Windows, every machine you ship, period, every microprocessor based machine that you ship, no matter what operating system is installed on us, just pay us a per processor rate. If you do that, you\\'ll be paying us for every machine, whether you ship DOS or Windows on it or not, but you\\'re going to ship DOS and Windows anyway.\\n\\nBen: You may as well take the cheaper rate.\\n\\nDavid: You may as well take the cheaper option. Obviously, what effect does this have on competition? There\\'s now a very, very, very strong incentive never to ship any other operating system.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Basically, you\\'re going to pay for two different operating systems, even though you\\'re only putting one on if you ever load a different operating system on. Yes, it very strongly incentivizes you to never ever ever ship any other operating systems on your computers as a company.\\n\\nThis is of course the way that regulators would look at it in 1994. That would get Microsoft in some hot water, and they had to agree to stop doing this practice. The way Microsoft would look at it is, we\\'re just helping our customers. Do you really think that these companies want to keep a whole separate ledger of what machines they shipped DOS on or Windows on versus what machines they shipped period? Wouldn\\'t it just be easier if once a month or once a quarter, they could just report to us their total shipments like they have to report to their investors anyway, and then we\\'ll just send them an invoice for all their machines?\\n\\nDavid: Totally. While antitrust and the government would seize onto this as a smoking gun, I think the reality is this was irrelevant in terms of the forces that made DOS and Windows the winners. They were already the winners by the time they started doing this.\\n\\nBen: If this had happened earlier, you could see how this would be more of a compelling way to get market share. But by the time they started doing it, they were already running away with the market.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Speaking of this new customer-friendly, buyer-friendly business practice from Microsoft, which I think is how they thought about it...\\n\\nBen: Totally. They wanted to make the stuff that people wanted to use the most, and that\\'s how they would win. Their goal was make the very best products, the best software we possibly can in the ways that people want to use and buy software, and then we\\'ll make a bunch of money.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. As this changing of the guard is happening from IBM to Microsoft, I think part of this new self confidence from Microsoft is, wait a minute, why can\\'t we go win the enterprise too and take that from IBM? We don\\'t have to get in bed with them to sell to the enterprise. We should sell to the enterprise.\\n\\nBen: The thing they were realizing is, well, we have made software that people like to use, so they\\'re using it in businesses. They always wanted that to be the goal, but now it was happening. People are doing their work in Excel. People are bringing PCs to the office.\\n\\nMaybe businesses are buying their PCs, but people are actually buying them themselves and using them in the office. It just made them that much more efficient. Microsoft really had to figure out how to sell to businesses, but we actually have no idea how to do that. It sounds crazy today. The Microsoft you know today, as late as the mid-90s, really had no idea how to sell or build software for businesses.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. This is the first half of the original Microsoft vision statement coming true, a PC on every desk and in every home. Desk means work, means enterprise. In this era, everybody we talk to, gives 100% of the credit to Steve Ballmer.\\n\\nSteve took it on his shoulders at this point in time when Microsoft is passing IBM to say, I am going to build, and we are going to learn as a company how to sell to enterprises. Ben, like you\\'re saying, it\\'s impossible to imagine now Microsoft not like this, but there\\'s so much that they needed to do that they didn\\'t have.\\n\\nBen: In part because prior to this, personal computers were not used by enterprises. It was just not an enterprise tool. Now that it was happening, Microsoft had to figure out how to be the ones that would benefit from it.\\n\\nDavid: That meant selling to the C-suite at global Fortune 500 companies, most of whom did not use computers.\\n\\nBen: Correct. Certainly, it didn\\'t want to buy operating systems one at a time.\\n\\nDavid: Right. To the extent, members of the C-suite like CIOs or proto IT organizations used computers or were the computing centers in the company, they hated the PC. It made their life hard. This was when employees would bring a PC to work, plop it down on their desk, and start mucking around with stuff. It made things hard.\\n\\nBen: And there really isn\\'t yet a business server that couples nicely with the PC on the desk. You have this weird thing where there\\'s a mainframe that is where the company\\'s real enterprise applications run, but people are bringing PCs. Those PCs don\\'t actually communicate well with anything else yet. They just are there for the employee to do their own work on a spreadsheet or something, print it out because finally 3.1 had printer drivers, and then deliver that. But it wasn\\'t a system that operated with other systems in your enterprise.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s no email. This really was a business transformation task for the global Fortune 500.\\n\\nBen: It wasn\\'t like, hey, let\\'s sell something to businesses that they want to buy. It\\'s, hey, let\\'s convince businesses that PCs are a good idea for their workforce to adopt.\\n\\nDavid: This was partnering with the consulting firms. This was building a direct sales force within Microsoft. This is building an indirect sales force within Microsoft to partner with distribution partners, with channel partners, with independent software vendors. This is building a customer service organization. This is building the executive briefing center on the Microsoft campus, and bringing CEOs and other C-suite folks there to Microsoft. It\\'s building solutions for them, it\\'s becoming a partner. It\\'s everything that Steve is frankly just born to do.\\n\\nBen: All of this stuff is pretty out of scope for this episode, including all the software systems you would need to build for the enterprise like Windows NT server, Exchange, SQL server, and Active Directory, the classic mid-2000s Microsoft stuff that they got known for. That is what this would all evolve into, and it really just started with everyone looking at Steve and saying, can you figure this out?\\n\\nWe\\'ve all to date basically just been either running dev teams, running marketing, or running product groups, and been selling through retail or distributors in the application side or mostly through OEMs on the systems and operating system side. But can you go figure out how to sell everything we make in a completely different way to a completely different buyer profile and keep us posted on how that needs to change all the products we make in order to do that? That\\'s a pretty crazy change.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. How it actually goes down, and we heard this from Steve and you heard it from other people, is so fitting. By the end of 1990, the Microsoft-IBM divorce is official. IBM takes full control of OS/2 development back from Microsoft. Microsoft ceases involvement. The breakup is official. This now gives Microsoft and Steve hunting license in the enterprise to go compete against IBM, but they have a secret weapon that is going to enable them to come take the enterprise from IBM. Ben, tell us what it is.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s painfully obvious. It\\'s Microsoft Office, and it\\'s the fact that the whole workforce is already using Microsoft Office. Everyone loves to talk about product-led growth and how it\\'s this new thing in the late 2010s, how Slack, Atlassian, Trello, and everyone figured out PLG. This bottoms-up workforce-adopted way, rather than selling to procurement, IT, or the central administrator. And it\\'s just not new.\\n\\nDavid: No. This has always been the case, and Microsoft invented it.\\n\\nBen: All the employees wanted to use Excel and Word. They were doing it anyway. At some point Microsoft needed to figure out how to take advantage of selling it centrally and how you do business with other businesses, rather than selling a zillion retail copies of people who are using it illegally for their work.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s so many things that are beautiful about this. It\\'s the legacy of this bet on the Mac, bet on Excel, and bet on Windows shortly thereafter, that enables Microsoft to go into the enterprise because even though they\\'ve just broken up with IBM and OS/2 isn\\'t going anywhere, it\\'s not like Steve can just go knock on the door of some banking CEO or C suite and be like, I\\'m Microsoft, come talk to me about how you\\'re going to use Microsoft products in your organization. But rather it\\'s like, hey, thousands of people in your organization are already using Excel. Let\\'s have a conversation about how we can make that work better for your organization, and what else Microsoft can do for you.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely. Next episode is going to be all about the enormous success of becoming an enterprise company, the enterprise agreement, cloud, and everything that came after that. But we have two chapters left in this episode, and they happen concurrently within the systems group by two very, very different teams, and that is Windows 95 and Windows NT.\\n\\nDavid, let\\'s start with NT, and then our little cherry on top can be 95 to close us out. How did Windows NT happen?\\n\\nDavid: Perfect, and it\\'s intertwined with the beginning of all this enterprisification of Microsoft. Okay, Windows NT. Remember, IBM\\'s whole goal with OS/2 was that they saw the trajectory of the PC was going to eat into traditional mainframe type applications in the enterprise. They wanted to recentralize and own the PC enterprisification of workloads. NT is, after the divorce, Microsoft being like, screw that we\\'re going to do the same thing and eat your lunch.\\n\\nThe initial work starts out of the work they had been doing on OS/2 with IBM. But then in October 1988, as they\\'re heading towards divorce, Microsoft hires Dave Cutler away from DEC. Dave is an absolute beast and legend. He\\'s still writing code at Microsoft today, which is amazing.\\n\\nBen: Isn\\'t that crazy? He\\'s in his 80s.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing. Dave at DEC wrote the whole operating system that DEC ran on VAX. Poaching him away to come work at Microsoft, he\\'s the guy that\\'s going to build an enterprise-ready, take share away from the way traditional enterprise computing is done onto the PC. He\\'s got the chops to do this, he\\'s also got the credibility to do this.\\n\\nBen: He\\'s written a widely-deployed enterprise operating system.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Him coming to Microsoft, him leading and building this effort, gives Steve and the sales force so much legitimacy when they\\'re going in and talking to the C-suites, the CIOs, the IT departments, and enterprises.\\n\\nBen: Even though they don\\'t yet have an enterprise product to sell, they\\'ve got DOS and early Windows, which is essentially consumer-targeted, but now they\\'ve got this guy, Dave.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, now they\\'ve got Dave.\\n\\nBen: We should say, this is really the first time they brought in someone who had real industry experience. In 1988, Microsoft was 13 years old, so Bill Gates would have been 33. Everyone is in their late 20s and early 30s, and Dave\\'s mid-40s. He\\'s like, you know I\\'ve seen a few things.\\n\\nDavid: I think it was Dave and also Mike Maples coming from IBM too. Mike obviously wasn\\'t a technical leader but on the business and strategy side, too. NT, we\\'ll talk a lot more about it on the next episode. But spoiler alert, it is the vision of what IBM wanted OS/2 to be, but it\\'s Microsoft\\'s version of it.\\n\\nBen: It enables all of your desktop computers at the company to join and network together in a compliant way. It enables an internal server that everything communicates with. It enables a directory of all the devices on the network and all the people in your organization.\\n\\nDavid: Soon with the Internet coming, it\\'ll enable servers that face externally from your company. The punchline here is that NT becomes the seeds of Windows Server, the business line, which become the seeds of Azure today.\\n\\nBen: The other important takeaway on NT is it was going to take a long time to build. It was going to take a long time to test. It was going to take a long time to sell and deploy, and it was going to have really strict requirements for what it could work on because it\\'s a power hungry operating system built for enterprise IT administrators. That is not your short-term product strategy. That is a long-term bet that a team is going to work on concurrently while you\\'re figuring out what to do after Windows 3.1.\\n\\nIn 1991, Bill Gates sums this up in a memo where he says, “Our strategy is Windows. One evolving architecture, a couple of implementations, and an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others.” Every word in that sentence does a bunch of heavy lifting.\\n\\nYou got one architecture. Okay. I think what that basically ends up meaning a few years later is one application programming interface (API) that developers can target so that when they want to write a Windows app, it works on both NT and whatever the evolution of 3.1 is. That\\'s one architecture, but it says one evolving architecture. That buys Microsoft a little bit more fluidity in the one architecture that\\'s being targeted.\\n\\nThen you hear a couple of implementations. This basically says, even though developers are targeting what became the Win32 API, the one way that we write applications, there are two different implementations. For many years, they would display very differently on NT systems versus—spoiler alert—Windows 95, the successor to Windows 3.1.\\n\\nDavid: By Windows 95, you mean Windows 4 that was supposed to ship in 1993?\\n\\nBen: Yes, I do, but it\\'s so much sexier to say Windows 95 and name it after the year that it actually ships. Yes, an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others sheds light on the DRG (Developer Relations Group) strategy. We got to go out and be massive evangelists, and everyone in the systems group is looking over at the apps group going, did you see that? Bill Gates just said our strategy is Windows. We\\'re now the Windows company, and that includes great applications from Microsoft and others.\\n\\nWhat does that mean, applications group? Let\\'s go first and best on Windows, get to it. I just think that sentence says it all for what we\\'re looking at 1991 through call it 2000 or so.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. We just spent a bunch of time talking about the enterprisification and all the amazing enterprise stuff that the seeds get sewn from Microsoft at this point in time. This era is also the heyday of the consumer PC. In 1993, Jensen starts NVIDIA, graphics cards are becoming a thing. PC gaming is becoming an industry. You can even look at Minesweeper as being a seminal moment in terms of the consumerization, these devices, these personal computers becoming companions to people\\'s lives like the phone is today. You\\'ve got CD-ROM technology, multimedia, Encarta. The heyday of the consumer PC is here in this era.\\n\\nBen: Totally. Even before Windows 95 shipped, they had 75 million Windows users. This is even before you get plug-and-play, multimedia, or networking. This is on Windows 3.1. Crazy.\\n\\nWe\\'ve been leading up to what we\\'ve been building hype, Windows 95, or should I say Chicago? The Chicago name, for those of you out there who were paying attention when this was under development, and you were all excited about what Windows 95 would become—and it\\'s probably 1% of our audience or something who knows the Chicago code name—they wanted to create an OS for the everyman, one that was easy to get to, a nice quality of life when you\\'re there, it was affordable. Chicago is the perfect name in every way. It is also a contrast to what was going on in a different part of Microsoft, where there was the codename of Cairo for a very ambitious next generation operating system.\\n\\nMind you, NT had already come out in 1993. Cairo is this general bucket of maybe it\\'s post-NT, maybe it\\'s part of NT, but this is a really sophisticated, crazy set of technologies that we\\'re going to eventually bake into an operating system. It doesn\\'t really have a release date. No one really believes in any of the release dates that are proposed.\\n\\nThe Windows 95 team, the Windows 4 team, the Chicago team, loved contrasting this idea of a far flung land that\\'s really ambitious. Who knows what it\\'ll actually be like? Chicago is something we know quite well. You get on I-90 from Seattle, you drive for three days, and you\\'re there. That is the goal. That\\'s the spiritual thing about Windows 95.\\n\\nDavid: Pizza, the bears, the cubs.\\n\\nBen: 100%. We should say, Cairo never shipped, so there\\'s a lesson in that.\\n\\nDavid: Might as well been called Oz.\\n\\nBen: Or Longhorn.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Okay, all right, we\\'re getting ahead of ourselves.\\n\\nBen: We are getting ahead of ourselves. Windows 95, let\\'s start with the launch event itself. It was a huge, ridiculous, insane day in Redmond, Washington. They set up tents all over Microsoft\\'s campus. They flew in journalists, beta testers. There was a movement around Windows 95 in a way that you would not believe. It was an operating system launch, and Jay Leno launched it. It wasn\\'t like Jay Leno did some stand up, it was Jay Leno for 90 minutes in a tightly scripted environment, co-hosted with Bill Gates all of the fanfare and festivities.\\n\\nDavid: There is no other word to describe the Windows 95 launch besides glorious. I am so glad that this stuff is preserved on the Internet and on YouTube, and that we could experience it ourselves over the past month.\\n\\nBen: It might be the peak moment of pure joy to celebrate technology before a lot of the skepticism came in and the tech haters.\\n\\nDavid: The DOJ.\\n\\nBen: Totally. It was unabashed celebration of software is probably the best way to put it. Microsoft license Start Me Up famously from the Rolling Stones.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s amazing, a software company licensed Start Me Up by the Rolling Stones as the official theme song of an operating system. The idea that this would be happening, certainly back in 1975 when they were moving to Albuquerque, but even just a couple of years earlier, this is breaking new ground.\\n\\nBen: Totally. The other thing that\\'s happening in 1995 is the Internet hype is starting to build, but we will table that for next episode. Right at this point in history, only 14% of Americans had internet access. It was still very early, so there was no guarantee that any story posted online would actually reach the masses. Microsoft had really relied on traditional broadcast coverage of this event, and brought in all these journalists, all these print magazines, and all these newspapers to build the hype.\\n\\nI watched the whole keynote yesterday. At the end, they ripped down the back of the tent behind the stage. There\\'s the entire development team in the red, yellow, green, and blue squares of the Windows logo sitting outside on the big sports field on Redmond\\'s campus. There\\'s only 360 people that built Windows 95, so it\\'s still a small team, but they\\'re all there. They\\'re fired up. They\\'re part of the moment. That\\'s the launch event in Redmond, at least.\\n\\nAround the world, people are lined up around the block to buy an operating system. There\\'s a lot of news coverage of that. It was basically the iPhone launch of its day. They lit up the CN Tower, the Tower of London. This date, August 24th, 1995, they basically treated an operating system launch the way that you would launch a movie or a new Madonna album. It was a marketing case study, so much so that the folks from Coca-Cola actually reached out to Microsoft to ask them, how do you do marketing this well in the new age?\\n\\nDavid: To the Bill Gates quote with the Warren Buffett talk at U-Dub.\\n\\nBen: Yes. This is a company that freaking invented Santa Claus to sell us all sugar water, and they\\'re calling Microsoft asking, how do you market in this new era? It was that successful. They launched concurrently worldwide in eight languages. This thread that Microsoft had of early international continued all the way through to this moment. They invested heavily in doing all of the localization and help stuff so that the whole world really could adopt something all at one time. It really was the perfect product at the right time, the Internet, games, all of that.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s so much about Windows 95 too that I\\'m sure you\\'re going to get into, but the start menu. It was so perfect because this was the peak of the PC going fully mainstream. Nobody had ever treated software like this before.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s the takeaway. They thought about software in a completely different way. Yes, the start menu, while it got cluttered, complicated, and messed up over time, the idea of a button that you click to start using your computer was very appealing to people.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. The Mac obviously shared a lot of these elements, but it was at so much a smaller scale.\\n\\nBen: The Mac just never had any real PC penetration. From the IBM PC forward, it never had big market share.\\n\\nDavid: This was your grandmother coming into the digital world.\\n\\nBen: That is how they tried to market it. They market it as people on job sites using Windows. They marketed it as people doing crafts. There\\'s someone who\\'s modeling something for an F1 car. It\\'s just fun watching all these old videos and seeing all the different personas.\\n\\nDavid: Computer companies love F1 cars for demos. It\\'s the ultimate aspirational demo.\\n\\nBen: I must say this all pains me deeply as someone who never owned a PC, grew up using a Mac, loved every bit of my Mac. I was even an apologist in the OS-9 era of this isn\\'t very good, but I\\'m still going to say it\\'s good. I was on the OS-10 public beta. I only clicked a start menu when I was fixing a teacher\\'s computer at school. Even though the takeaway here is everyone thought this was a great operating system and it won the market, I always looked at it like, well, it\\'s not a Mac.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s how Mac users always look at Windows.\\n\\nBen: The way that Apple products became mainstream always felt odd to me as someone who was using them when they weren\\'t, but it\\'s been interesting gaining a new appreciation for Microsoft through studying their history that I absolutely did not have as a user during this era.\\n\\nDavid: Having this discussion now makes me think, Windows 95, they did what Apple tried to do in bringing Scully in. Scully came from Pepsi. Obviously, that didn\\'t work, but Microsoft, they\\'re the ones who did it. They\\'re the ones who mass-marketified the computing vision.\\n\\nBen: It was the wrong strategy for Apple, and it was the right strategy for Microsoft. Apple has always, at least in my opinion, created a better computing experience by being completely integrated. It\\'s the Alan Kay quote, \"Anyone who cares about making great software needs to build their own hardware.\" The complete integrated package that Apple offers, I have always found to be the best computing experience. And it doesn\\'t scale.\\n\\nDavid: It didn\\'t in that era for sure.\\n\\nBen: In that era, yeah. The way to scale is Make the software that is going to get distributed on the most PCs, and then that is the most interesting to software developers. It is the most interesting to consumers who want the software and IT buyers who want to buy the standard thing. Apple\\'s strategy versus Microsoft strategy in this era, Apple was always going to be a bit player rather than the scale winner.\\n\\nThe trade off is lots of PCs had blue screens of death, Apple never had blue screens of death. Where do blue screens come from? It\\'s driver problems. It\\'s that the printer is not speaking the same language as your particular computer and what the operating system knows about your computer, and are the device drivers right for your particular version of whatever\\'s on your motherboard? Apple never had those issues, but they also had very few units shipped and much more expensive product.\\n\\nDavid: Sidebar. That Alan Kay quote about if you really care about software, you do your own hardware, makes so much more sense to me now having done this episode, because he\\'s coming from having made the Alto and the graphical interface there. The only way that he could have made the GUI on the Alto was basically building a mini computer.\\n\\nBen: Isn\\'t that crazy?\\n\\nDavid: It makes so much more sense now.\\n\\nBen: A little bit more on Windows 95 before we finish the story here, it is remarkable to reflect that it took 5–6 years to go from Windows\\' plan B to Microsoft being extremely right that that was the franchise, that was the bet to bet the entire company on.\\n\\nAs Brad Silverberg put it this way to me, he said, Windows 95 cemented Windows as the franchise product for Microsoft, which interestingly it was not yet. David, this is crazy. It would remain the franchise product for the next 20 years, perhaps 5 or 10 years too long, but we\\'ll save that story.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Just to put some numbers on this, August 24th, 1995 is the launch event, the glorious day. Windows 95 comes out. It sells a million copies in the first week, seven million copies in the first month.\\n\\nFiscal 1995—this is the 12 months ending in June before Windows 95 comes out—Microsoft did $5.9 billion in revenue. Fiscal 1996, they did $8.7 billion. Fiscal 1997 when Windows 95 is really going, they do $12 billion in revenue. First software company to pass $10 billion in revenue, already the most valuable company in the world. They are a monster. There is no other way to put it.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s crazy. From a product perspective, there was just so much really got smoothed here. This was a user experience where they finally had time to think, what actually do users want to do with an operating system? What features should be part of the OS, and what should we delegate to applications? What are modern networking technologies that we should bring in?\\n\\nI don\\'t want to foreshadow too much, but how should the Internet be in a modern operating system? That was a huge thing. The multimedia, the video stuff. An operating system really showed up and said, we thought about this experience for you. You\\'re looking for where to start, you\\'re looking for cool stuff to do, and you\\'re looking for it to not break on you. We now finally have a complete story around all of that.\\n\\nA couple of interesting technical notes, it was basically all new technology. If you try to look this up, it will tell you, Windows 95 was DOS-based. It still used DOS in fallback situations for older DOS applications or drivers. But for most of the time, it was no longer true that Windows was just an operating environment on top of the DOS operating system.\\n\\nWindows had now become a true 32-bit operating system of its own. Windows did all the heavy lifting. It had its own file system. It accomplished a lot of the user experience magic and speed that it was praised for by rewriting a lot of this from scratch. This was the beginning of Windows as its own OS. You can see that actually change in the marketing messages that change from operating environment to operating system.\\n\\nDavid, that brings us to the end of our chapter one. We\\'ve got plenty of analysis here to do, but my God, what a first 20 years for the company.\\n\\nDavid: We knew this was going to happen. This is why we waited 10 years into Acquired\\'s life to cover Microsoft. It\\'s the most important company in the world still today.\\n\\nIt was so fun researching, going back and doing all this because there are so many different perspectives, and so much has been written. I don\\'t know if we\\'ve gotten it right here, but I feel like every other major attempted storytelling at this has not gotten it right. Getting to go talk to all the people who were part of this...\\n\\nBen: Yeah, living in Seattle is quite helpful.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. We really got that sense of like, there\\'s still a story to be told here. It\\'s never been more relevant again than today. All that to say, I\\'m glad we waited 10 years.\\n\\nBen: And there\\'s all this stuff we miss. I didn\\'t mention Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research was a lot of people and a lot of money.\\n\\nDavid: Microsoft tried to buy Intuit too along the way. That got canned.\\n\\nBen: Actually, the start of research is interesting. I\\'ll say this real quick. In 1991, Nathan Myhrvold started Microsoft Research, and the logic is fascinating. Basically, everything Microsoft had done until that point was taking things from mainframes and mini computers, and adapting those tasks, those jobs to be done for personal computers.\\n\\nAt some point, they looked around and said, all right, well, we did it. All the personal and business applications can now be run on personal computers, so we have to come up with uses for future technologies in order to continue to drive the ecosystem forward. There\\'s no more low hanging fruit. I thought that was an interesting thesis of why to spin up a research division at that point in history.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Let\\'s move into analysis.\\n\\nBen: Okay, great. Playbook. The big interesting one that I want to start with, and it actually involves a chapter from the story that we just glossed over, is capital efficiency allows founders to control their own destinies in a way that you just don\\'t get when you\\'re selling off huge chunks of the company in order to accomplish your mission.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, I love this.\\n\\nBen: Let\\'s just talk through the cap table over time and how the company went public. We talked about the partnership being 64% Gates, 36% Paul Allen. In 1980, Steve Ballmer comes in and gets 8.5%, 8.75%, or something that percent of the company, so dilutes Gates and Allen down.\\n\\nIn 1981, just a year later, they take the VC investment for 5% of the company from TVI. This also, I\\'m guessing around 5% trying to reverse engineer some of the numbers. They also created an option pool, where they were then creating opportunity for basically rewarding management, which is how there were 10,000 millionaires created in the Seattle area from Microsoft.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s the amazing thing. The option pool doesn\\'t get created until late in Microsoft\\'s life. All those Microsoft millionaires only came from whatever size that was, 5% of the company or whatever.\\n\\nBen: At IPO, even with all this dilution, you\\'ve got the Ballmer dilution, the VC dilution, and the option pool dilution, Bill Gates still owned 49% of the company. That\\'s pretty unprecedented. He wasn\\'t the only one with a big chunk. Paul Allen owned 28% of the company. Steve had 7.5% of the company.\\n\\nThis company was basically owned by the three more or less co-founders. A little tiny option pool, and then a VC who ended up with 6.1%. I think Dave got some more shares from being on the board. You just don\\'t see companies that look this anymore.\\n\\nDavid: This is Bill\\'s company. This is their company in a way that no other company is these days. No venture-backed company going through the modern era is like that. By the time you get to be public, you may still be the largest shareholder as a founder or CEO, but it\\'s not your company, far from it.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely. I\\'m trying to figure out why they were able to be so capital efficient. Is it just that software was such an unbelievably good business model compared to everything else that existed? They didn\\'t need a lot of working capital, everything was high margin, they could grow really fast. Or it was just an era before much competition. They didn\\'t need to out-raise their competitors. Once they got a little bit ahead, there was really no way for anybody else to close the gap, assuming that they executed well.\\n\\nDavid: I totally think it\\'s the latter. I think it\\'s that the minimum fixed cost threshold to be that, in Bill\\'s words, slightly better than your competitors and get the positive spiral going, was low enough that it could be paid for just in Bill and Paul\\'s time and effort. There was that unique moment at the beginning of the software industry where that was true, and that would never be true again.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s so, so, so insane. There was no one else really with the knowledge either. Even if someone else came in with a big $1 million check and gave it to a competitor, in 1975, how many people could really write these language interpreters?\\n\\nDavid: You couldn\\'t buy the experience having written emulation software for microprocessors that Paul had.\\n\\nBen: They had an obsession and an obscure skill that turned out to be one of the most valuable in the world in an area where there was a freak law of nature in play with Moore\\'s Law that was so unintuitive, that you had to think from real first principles to understand the impacts of it.\\n\\nDavid: I think there are two freak laws of nature\\'s one. (1) There was Moore\\'s law that they were benefiting from. (2) There was the zero marginal cost of software.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true. It\\'s this complete perfect storm that enabled them to build a highly defensible business without really any investment ever. This is the largest company in the world, the most valuable company in the world that was entirely bootstrapped.\\n\\nDavid: Even though they raised money, not a single dollar of investment actually happened at this company.\\n\\nBen: No, and in 1986, when they actually did go public, they raised $45 million. They never spent that because they generated much more free cash flow than that that year.\\n\\nDavid: It was just a means to an end of getting public.\\n\\nBen: And they needed to for the reason that they had been granting so many stock options from that little option pool to employees that they were going to blow the SEC\\'s 500 shareholder cap. They projected 1987, so they wanted to go public on their own terms in 1986, not when they had to buy SEC rules.\\n\\nDavid: Also, Microsoft needed to be a public company. If you\\'re going to be an important company in the world at this scale, if you\\'re going to first ride the bear with IBM but then inherit the earth from IBM, you got to be a public company. You can\\'t be a private partnership. You\\'re not going to go have conversations with C-suites and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies if you are a private partnership in this era especially.\\n\\nBen: Maybe. I don\\'t know. I\\'d agree with you if you had a bunch of short-term capital interests that owned your company, but if it\\'s all founder-owned, there are great, large private companies in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, fair, true.\\n\\nBen: Coke Industries is a trusted company by a whole bunch of their customers. Cargill is even bigger than that. There\\'s a bunch of European industrial and shipping companies. Rolex. There are privately-held, big, important companies in the world.\\n\\nDavid: For sure, but none of those companies are Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true. That\\'s very fair. Especially getting to the stage that they eventually got to being the trusted partner to governments around the free world, that requires being a public company.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s funny. This playbook theme, this was a moment in time and a set of factors where this worked. I guess the lesson is find an industry in its infancy, be capital-efficient, and run the table.\\n\\nBen: That has unique economic conditions that have never existed before to create these magical businesses you could never fathom before this new technology thing existed? It\\'s an impossible thing to wish for. It may never happen again. We may never get another Google either.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s what I was going to say, it did happen again, it happened with Google.\\n\\nBen: But how many things can you collapse to zero? I think that\\'s the question. With Microsoft, they were able to collapse their marginal cost to zero, but they still had distribution costs, and then Google collapsed distribution costs to zero with the Internet. What\\'s a big cost that a company has now? Maybe AI will collapse. You no longer need 50,000 employees, you can have five employees. Maybe it can collapse that to zero.\\n\\nYou need something of that scale, which is, where does a company spend most of its money that suddenly it can spend no money on? I suppose actually it is on the human capital. You just look at big successful companies and look at what they spend money on. Those are the candidates.\\n\\nDavid: Good point. Still unlikely we\\'ll ever find another Microsoft opportunity.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Other fun things on the IPO, do you know who IPO\\'d the day before Microsoft did?\\n\\nDavid: No.\\n\\nBen: Oracle. Oracle had a nice pop, which actually helped Microsoft price a little bit higher in their IPO. That is another episode we have to do.\\n\\nAnother thing adds yet another layer to the insanity of everything that we\\'ve been talking about of why they were able to build such a successful company on such little capital, I don\\'t think there has ever been a tailwind in history like the one that Microsoft had with the secular growth of the personal computer wave. The only thing I can think of that is comparable is Amazon with the growth of the Internet, powering their early growth.\\n\\nHere\\'s the stat. From 1975 to 1986, 11 years prior to their IPO, so founding to IPO, PCs grew at a compound annual growth rate of 98%. It grew from 4000 units per year to 9 million units per year shipped. You can almost not mess up when you have a tailwind that.\\n\\nDavid: Especially when you are the linchpin player.\\n\\nBen: They managed to make themselves the point of integration for the whole industry. Oftentimes, I find myself when we\\'re looking at these companies that are among the most successful in the world or like Microsoft, the most successful in the world, it\\'s basically a multidimensional multiplication problem.\\n\\nThey had this unbelievable one in a zillion thing going for them, which you can multiply by this other one in a zillion multi thing. It\\'s the zero marginal cost, zero distribution cost, unbelievable secular growth of the PC, Moore\\'s law happening. They\\'re the single choke point for the whole industry. It\\'s just crazy how many things you multiply together, and of course it should end up in a number over three trillion.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. I\\'ll jump in with a playbook theme that we referenced a little bit in the episode, but we really got a highlight here. Bill, Steve, Paul, and everybody at Microsoft, were incredibly talented, incredibly smart. They saw the future in a way nobody else did, but they also were willing to hedge their bets.\\n\\nIt\\'s not like they just got everything right. They were going to get things wrong with OS/2, but they hedged the bets with Windows. I think that is such a key lesson of when you\\'re in a really dynamic market like this, in our ecosystem right now in tech, venture capital, startups, whatnot, people put so much value on conviction. I have conviction. This is what the future is going to be like. I think the Microsoft story is the opposite of that. They had conviction that software was going to be big.\\n\\nBen: And personal computers. Creating software for desktop computers was a really good idea, and they wanted to be the best at it.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, but the exact path of how that was going to play out, they had very little conviction and were willing to be very flexible.\\n\\nBen: You\\'re right. It\\'s both the hedging, but also then the ability to read the world and quickly, entirely change your strategy if you need to, and having your hedge be far enough along that you can jump quickly to it and shift your whole organization to get on board with it. That\\'s a hard leadership thing to do.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I can\\'t wait in the next episode to talk about the Internet tidal wave memo. That\\'s related to your playbook theme too. You can\\'t really do that if you don\\'t own 49% of the company, if it\\'s not your company.\\n\\nBen: Which I think you\\'re seeing play out with most CEOs today. There\\'s a big difference between a founder-CEO and the stuff that they can do. Zuckerberg with the metaverse or Jensen with betting the whole company and going all in again on AI versus Tim Cook or Sundar Pichai, certainly a very different type of CEO. Satya is interesting. Despite the fact that he doesn\\'t own half the company, he\\'s got a lot of founder-like control, which I think is pretty interesting.\\n\\nDavid: All right, don\\'t get ahead of ourselves.\\n\\nBen: Moving along. Other playbook themes, a big one that jumps out to me is that new generations of technologies enable market dislocations. Unless you are in a transformational moment in terms of a new technology came out that enables something that wasn\\'t possible before that\\'s going to rearrange the whole value chain and open up new markets, it\\'s pretty hard to go challenge an incumbent. No one was going to challenge IBM really until the microcomputer, even the minicomputer people. Did DEC really challenge IBM? Not really. It never made a dent.\\n\\nDavid: It wasn\\'t a full platform shift in the same way.\\n\\nBen: And there are these little blips of it. The GUI I think meaningfully reshuffled the DECs. Those are the moments where you can have meaningful new entrants. Otherwise, you have to bide your time and just build your hedges and see.\\n\\nRelated, even if you are the incumbent being disrupted, it is possible to have a very, very large and durable revenue stream that can go on for a very long time. What I\\'m referring to in this particular example is despite all of the dethroning that we just talked about, Microsoft would not eclipse IBM in revenue. You mentioned market cap, David, but in revenue until the year 2015. Isn\\'t that nuts?\\n\\nDavid: I intentionally didn\\'t look up revenue because it made the story muddier, but wow, there you go.\\n\\nBen: I think that\\'s the point. Microsoft\\'s perception by the market, I\\'m sure they were growing faster, I\\'m sure they had better gross margins. I\\'m sure there was a better story there, so there\\'s a multiple that comes out of the story. I\\'m sure there are lots of good reasons why Microsoft became more valuable than IBM very early, but IBM\\'s revenue did not peak until 2012. What?\\n\\nLong after public perception moves on, customers still get value from something created by incumbents for a very long time. I think that\\'s something we often forget about in the buzzy Twitterverse of like, oh that thing\\'s over. It might still grow for another 20 years before it\\'s over.\\n\\nDavid: That also just speaks to the nature of the enterprise business, too.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s a good point.\\n\\nDavid: IBM was the enterprise business. Today, Microsoft is the enterprise business.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true. Peloton revenue can dry up a lot faster than contracts for mainframes. What do you got?\\n\\nDavid: A playbook theme that I want to highlight that really, really came out in our conversations is Microsoft was not just a talent magnet, the talent magnet during the PC era. If you were an ambitious young person, this is where you wanted to be.\\n\\nIt was on every dimension. If you were an ambitious young technical person, that\\'s where you wanted to be. If you were an ambitious young salesperson, if you\\'re an ambitious young marketing person, that\\'s where you wanted to be.\\n\\nThey just had this culture there, which is so funny. We\\'ll talk in the next episode of how that culture really fell apart for a while there. I asked a lot of these early people that we talked to, what was it being there? You guys worked yourselves half to death. Were you mad about that? Did you resent it? Were you just making Bill rich? They\\'re all like, no. Yeah, we neglected every other part of our life, but that was the good old days. This was the magic, we were making it happen.\\n\\nBen: That totally comes through. I asked Brad, why did Windows 95 work? There\\'s lots of structural reasons, but he said, we basically did two things. (1) We laid out principles for product and then pushed responsibility down. Developers were often their own PMs. There\\'s this idea of once you got the principles, we don\\'t need to write a zillion specs, design something three times, and pass it through three functions. You know the principles, make great software that follows the principles. (2) He said that everyone felt personally responsible for the product, and it really showed.\\n\\nDavid: Anybody you talked to from this era of Microsoft, this was their life\\'s work. No doubt about it.\\n\\nBen: Something we touched on a little bit is the benefit of scaling with OEMs. This was the contrast against Apple, where I said Apple was always going to be a niche player by the way that they designed, built, and packaged everything themselves. Apple is in many ways like the AmEx, where Microsoft is the Visa.\\n\\nOn our Visa episode, it just became so clear that Visa could quickly take over the world at MasterCard by being an open network, where they didn\\'t have to do all the work to scale themselves. They could distribute to a bank, partner with a bank, and then boom, each of the banks that was on their network could independently scale at their own rate, which created obviously compounding effects for how fast Visa and MasterCard could scale. The same can be said of Windows.\\n\\nDavid: Totally, the OEMs. Yeah.\\n\\nBen: I think the Microsoft OEM team for Windows was 20 people or something. Before the enterprise, in this era that we\\'re talking about, the group of people responsible for go-to market for Windows was really small. They sold some retail, but the team was just about, hey, make sure HP and...\\n\\nDavid: Compaq, Dell, and Gateway.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. That was their go-to market, and it makes your scaling unbelievably efficient.\\n\\nDavid: Dude, you\\'re getting a Dell.\\n\\nBen: Dude, you are getting a Dell. Similarly, I think the fact that they went international early was this very powerful constraint. It meant that every time they shipped software, they had to make it globally ready quickly. That meant that if there was any network effects to your software, anything becoming a standard, Microsoft was just way better positioned to become the standard than anyone else was.\\n\\nOn top of there being network effects, there\\'s also scale economies. A word processor is a word processor. The extent that you have customers in every country who can buy your one piece of software, you can amortize the development costs over a huge user base so much more quickly.\\n\\nDavid: 100%.\\n\\nBen: The fact that they forced themselves to be international early meant that every product after that also had to figure out how to do all the localization, training, and all of that to get all those effects too.\\n\\nDavid: No matter how much time, money, and resources you have to spend to localize Microsoft word into kanji, it\\'s a lot less time and resources and money than developing Microsoft word.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. They just realized that so early. They also realized that most people who were doing some localization would do a shoddy job. They would think about it as lesser than the US market. They just did a good job at localization. They just cared. They thought of it as this is a strategic pillar that in every country, everyone experiences our software to the same quality because it\\'s our brand everywhere. I don\\'t know. I just think that is not how the rest of the industry thought about it.\\n\\nDavid: Definitely not.\\n\\nBen: On top of all of this, the way that they executed it through subsidiaries was pretty genius. Redmond did not control international. They spun up country managers and subsidiaries in each of these countries in a ton of countries.\\n\\nWhile Redmond did the product development and then did the engineering work to do localization to all the strings files and everything for those countries, the actual marketing messaging, the sales strategy, and the sales structure, happened in country that was owned by a person who lived there so they actually could think through, what is the best way for people to receive this software here?\\n\\nAgain, that\\'s just going to yield way better results than if you\\'re sitting there armchair quarterbacking at Redmond thinking about how a person in Chile is going to receive your marketing message.\\n\\nOne other that I have is this one that we didn\\'t really talk about, but Microsoft famously was not first to market with basically any of their applications. They aren\\'t even really today in most cases. You think about the strategy that they had early on spreadsheets, word processing, all these were copycats at their outset.\\n\\nSometimes they would do an acquisition, but most of the time they just look at a product and say, huh, our software should do the same thing, and they would copy it. They had no shame in doing that. They had their eyes everywhere looking for good ideas, they had reverence for the good ones, and then they would just incorporate them.\\n\\nOn top of that, they wanted to make the software very easy to switch to. A lot of the keyboard shortcuts in Excel to this day are there because they were originally the Lotus 1-2-3 shortcuts. They wanted people to have the same muscle memory that just worked.\\n\\nFundamentally, what this does for you as a business is it just leads to better risk adjusted returns. You already know what\\'s going to work before you ship it. You don\\'t really take market risk. You\\'re not going to be the first to the market with early adopters, but most of the time, you actually don\\'t need to be to win.\\n\\nI think Microsoft own that idea. Most of the time people are sheepish about it. Steve Jobs famously said, Microsoft has no taste. I think that\\'s another way to put it that it\\'s copycatting.\\n\\nDavid: I do agree with the premise, with all of this. I think doing this episode though has made me think there\\'s a little more nuance to it. Yes. In broad strokes, you can say that\\'s what Microsoft strategy was with applications over the years, but the Microsoft versions never actually won until there was a platform shift that they could take advantage of to beat the incumbent.\\n\\nMicrosoft wasn\\'t going to beat Lotus 1-2-3 until the graphical paradigm came along, and then Excel being graphical was just obviously so much better. They tried with Multiplan, they failed. Multiplan was fine, but 1-2-3 was the winner.\\n\\nThe nuance to me is yes, but it\\'s more like with the resources of Microsoft and the timeframe that Microsoft can afford to have, they can afford to start building the application, start building the product, getting into market, start learning, be positioned that then when the paradigm shift comes, leap ahead.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s a good point. It\\'s also different. The Lotus 1-2-3–Multiplan thing, in that era, Microsoft just didn\\'t have great distribution yet. Lotus 1-2-3 just got pretty far ahead of them, and Microsoft had no way to catch up. A few years after that, that would basically never be true again.\\n\\nDavid: That could be true too.\\n\\nBen: I will say, you touched on something that\\'s an interesting corollary to this. Their first versions of software famously are not good. You look at Windows 1.0 and 2.0. They know that it\\'s part of the strategy, and they were world class at learning from customers and integrating customer feedback into subsequent versions.\\n\\nThere\\'s always this saying of Microsoft doesn\\'t have a very good first or second version, but the third version of something is typically pretty good. I think that fact pattern definitely follows.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'m curious your thoughts on this. I\\'m so surprised. One thing that you have not brought up yet on this episode is you were a PM at Microsoft for several years.\\n\\nBen: I was, but it was such a different era in that 2012–2014 era. I guess 2011 is when I started as an intern. I\\'ll have a lot of thoughts on it next episode.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, great. I\\'ve got one more playbook theme before we move on to power. Microsoft figured out software before anybody else, and they figured out so many aspects of what it means to be a software business before anybody else, but they figured out that software is never done.\\n\\nI do think a lot of their competitors, we didn\\'t obviously didn\\'t study Lotus to the same degree that we studied Microsoft here, we didn\\'t study WordPerfect, et cetera, but I think there was a mindset that a lot of other folks are like, you ship software, and then the software was done.\\n\\nThat was not the culture at Microsoft. This is related to what you were just saying. Shipping software is the beginning. You are always working on that software. You\\'re working on next versions and stuff, but even before the next version, the work of software is never done.\\n\\nBen: Of course, if you own the hardware, you definitely think of it more of like, well, we ship them, the big cabinet of things, we install it, and we fix it if it\\'s broken, but we\\'ve sold them hardware. The software is required to run it, but the thing we sold them is the hardware. If you\\'re a pure software company, you think about the world differently.\\n\\nYou\\'re like, well, I can always ship you another CD, another floppy disk, over the Internet. It\\'s obviously very different. But because there weren\\'t really software companies before them, of course people didn\\'t come from that mindset.\\n\\nDavid: I think you still see the legacy of this right to this day in Apple versus Microsoft. Apple still is on a yearly software release cadence, which is ridiculous. Whereas Microsoft is on the cloud, it\\'s all constant. It\\'s all constantly shipping. Look at AI, look at OpenAI. The software is never done so deeply in the software business model.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true.\\n\\nDavid: All right, should we move on to power?\\n\\nBen: Yes. Listeners who are new to the show, we do this section based on Hamilton Helmer\\'s seven powers framework. The question is, what is it that enables a business to achieve persistent differential returns, or to put in another way, to be more profitable than your closest competitor and do so sustainably?\\n\\nThe seven are counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs, network economies, process power, branding, and cornered resource. David, I am pretty sure I could make a case somewhere between 1975 and 1995 at Microsoft for all seven of these.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s one of the most defensible businesses they built in history, so of course they would have all seven of the powers.\\n\\nDavid: All right, let\\'s run through each of them and do a quick 45 seconds on each.\\n\\nBen: Great. Counter positioning. I think the biggest example of this comes through where Microsoft is basically willing to jump on the microcomputer revolution before the incumbents were. IBM did not want microcomputers to happen. When they started to happen, IBM tried to figure out how to slow it down and reintegrate it into their old business model.\\n\\nMicrosoft basically had no baggage. This is classic innovator’s dilemma stuff. They could say, well, we don\\'t need to make any money on hardware. We don\\'t need to even make hardware. We are free to become the whole point of integration for the entire ecosystem just by shipping bits. And that is crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Actually, related to that—I can\\'t believe we haven\\'t talked about this in the episode until now—Microsoft could enable other companies to be successful. You talk to Microsoft people, they always talk about themselves as a platform, like we\\'re a platform. Other companies grow on the back of Microsoft. That was not true for IBM. Totally not true.\\n\\nMicrosoft could make Compaq successful. Microsoft could make Lotus successful. Microsoft could make Intuit successful. Microsoft could make Netscape successful.\\n\\nBen: We keep talking about Microsoft as the point of integration, choke point, dependency, or standard for the whole ecosystem. Given that, it is quite remarkable how much value they created on top of the platform versus just captured for themselves. There\\'s that famous Bill Gates line, you want your ecosystem around you to be generating more revenue than you are taking for yourself. They did a ton of that. It\\'s the OEMs, and it\\'s the application developers.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s major counter positioning. Okay, that\\'s one.\\n\\nBen: Scale economies.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s everything we just talked about in Playbook.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s unbelievable. When Microsoft has an install base of 100 million people using Excel—in this episode, let\\'s just say 10 million people who are using Excel—and suddenly some up and coming spreadsheet comes out with a cool feature like auto sum, fill down, draw borders around the cells, or whatever, suddenly, Microsoft does a tiny bit of dev work. They can reap tons and tons and tons of value for doing that that the tiny company cannot do.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, great.\\n\\nBen: Fixed amount of dev work amortized across a large customer base.\\n\\nDavid: I don\\'t think we need to say any more on this. The whole episode\\'s about scale economies.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Switching costs. The funny thing about monopoly is there\\'s nothing to switch to.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s a good one. This one\\'s pretty related to network economies for me with this one of, okay, sure, you can switch to another operating system. Good luck getting other applications that you know and love to run on that.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, that\\'s the answer.\\n\\nDavid: Speaking of network economies, developers, applications, OEMs.\\n\\nBen: There\\'s not a classic network, Facebook, or AT&T style network here, in terms of one user can contact every other user, but more users being on Windows incentivizes more developers to make great applications for Windows, which enables Microsoft to sell more copies to more users, et cetera.\\n\\nDavid: Although, actually, I think once they start getting into the enterprise workplaces in general, organizations in general, there is the user network effect, like I want this Microsoft Word document that I just worked on for you to be able to open it and use it too.\\n\\nBen: You\\'re right. I didn\\'t even think about that. The document formats are a huge network effect thing, even before the Internet. Even before organizations were networked and computers were networked outside of an organization, file formats. You\\'re right, there are huge network economies to file formats.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and it\\'s inter-organizational too. If I\\'m a law firm, I want my clients to be able to open my Word docs.\\n\\nBen: Right.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, next.\\n\\nBen: Process power. This might be the weakest.\\n\\nDavid: As it so often is.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s elusive. This is a little bit later in history, but I did always think it was absolutely incredible when I was at Microsoft, and we would ship a version of Office every three years. I worked on Office 15. The entire 6000 person organization had a process in place, where we could release to manufacturing (RTM) on a date that we planned three years in advance and actually hit it.\\n\\nThe process of the ads cuts meetings, the zero bug bounce, the testing schedule, and the triage when you had things that people wanted to introduce late in the schedule. It was a remarkable product, especially with all these teams that needed all their code to interoperate.\\n\\nI worked on a shared experiences team that would check things and that would be a dependency. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, all of them took on the shared code. We knew our ship date three years in advance and would hit it. It\\'s crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. This exists. Especially by the time you get to the Windows 95 era at the end of this episode, it\\'s like RenTech. The amount of stuff and process within Microsoft, the device drivers, the middleware, the programming languages, the dev tools, the machine there to make all this computing work, there was a miracle that this stuff worked. You couldn\\'t just recreate that.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s funny. The process power, I would say, is stronger in Office than Windows. Now my colors are showing. Windows always notoriously miss their ship dates. I\\'m actually less sure that process power existed in that early days. I think they were a bunch of smart people, but I\\'m not sure that they had a unique way of creating software.\\n\\nDavid: I think that got built over time.\\n\\nBen: Agree.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, branding, for sure.\\n\\nBen: For sure.\\n\\nDavid: Don\\'t get fired for buying Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true. Windows 95 built a consumer brand. The idea of a consumer brand of operating systems was there was Apple, but they were tiny, and that was more around the hardware.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s both fronts. It\\'s their brand in the enterprise that is an amazing story that they built. They were branding consumer. The easiest to point to instantiation is the Rolling Stones and Jay Leno, but they had a software brand. Nobody had that.\\n\\nBen: But branding is probably the thing that they rely on the least interestingly enough. There are other structural reasons that they\\'re entrenched, where even if Microsoft had a crappy brand in this era, they probably still would have won. The magic of getting the whole deal with the IBM PC and then getting to sell licenses to all the other OEMs.\\n\\nDavid: That brings us to the last one, which I think is a super strong one at least in this era, cornered resource. DOS, full stop.\\n\\nBen: Yup. It didn\\'t start as a cornered resource, but as soon as IBM started shipping it on the IBM PCs, it was over. I\\'ll say it again, IBM\\'s distribution created demand for DOS, and then Microsoft just got to capture value from everyone else who wanted it.\\n\\nAll right, we would do bear and bull, listeners, but we know what happened after this. The bull case is that the party continues, and Microsoft continues shipping amazing operating systems after amazing operating systems. That stays the important thing in the world. The bear case is something else becomes an important thing in the world. Just having this super locked-in operating system is not actually the way to bet your whole company for the future.\\n\\nDavid: The dramatic tension for you all to come back for our next episode on Microsoft here is not because you want to find out what happens.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, take away, splinter. We\\'ve spent the last probably six weeks deep in this. We\\'ve talked to everybody. What are you thinking about in the middle of the night?\\n\\nBen: The IBM deal. I can\\'t unsee it. Microsoft figured out a way to take someone else\\'s dominance and wholesale transfer that into their dominance for the next generation. The fact that IBM called the Project Chess is so deeply ironic because Bill Gates was playing chess and they played checkers.\\n\\nDavid: Maybe Bill was playing 3D chess. This is the thing about it, though. We got to give IBM so much credit for Project Chess and the PC, that they even did what they did was huge, that a big entrenched corporation that could ship a skunkworks project in a year, revolutionized the industry. They just didn\\'t end up capturing any value out of it.\\n\\nBen: If I could make a less cheeky comment on it, I would say it\\'s that a new technology generation, when something becomes possible and opens up a new market, it enables a shift in the point of integration and a value chain.\\n\\nThe old value chain of IBM, if you shipped the mainframe, you had all the power. But in this new world of PCs, if you controlled the operating system that all the users were familiar with and all the developers wanted to target, you had all the power. I think that is not necessarily obvious unless you went through it and have the hindsight of history to be able to articulate it.\\n\\nDavid: I think you might be right. I think this might be the single best business deal negotiation of all time.\\n\\nBen: It arguably created $3 trillion of value.\\n\\nDavid: No, a lot more than that because this is the point about Microsoft being a platform. Microsoft is worth $3 trillion, but how much value has been created on top of Microsoft? No matter what you think, good, bad, or ugly of Microsoft, you can\\'t deny that.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely.\\n\\nDavid: At least twice as much, probably much, much more.\\n\\nBen: You watch every early interview with Bill, and you read a lot of his writing, he\\'s a great writer. It\\'s awesome that so many of his memos leaked whether intentionally or unintentionally over time.\\n\\nDavid: So many of his memos were issued for publication.\\n\\nBen: He really did view himself as a steward of the software ecosystem, and had this steadfast belief that software was magic and was going to change the world. Over the next 20 years, from 1975 to 1995, software did change the world, and Microsoft enabled it to happen.\\n\\nAgain, good, bad, or ugly, whatever you think of the company, they were sincere. I think the ugly part is, a lot of people want to hate on the value capture, because god did they capture value, but they were sincere in their desire and ability to create too.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. That\\'s super related to my takeaway here. The moment for me in the research and then when we\\'re telling the story along the way is when they start to believe in themselves that they don\\'t need IBM. Just the audacity, and I mean that in a pure good way of these kids. These kids changed the world. That\\'s so trite to say.\\n\\nMy book we read my daughter at bedtime and somebody gave us, it\\'s like the most Silicon Valley trophy thing ever. It\\'s like, what do you do with an idea? The punchline at the end of it is you change the world. It\\'s become such a trope, but these kids in the 70s did it. They believed in themselves in the beginning and then more and more and more over time.\\n\\nThere\\'s just this moment that I think, where they started to really, truly believe that they were going to change the world. Again, good, bad and ugly come out of that. Mostly good, I think, but just the level of ambition and audacity of these people is staggering.\\n\\nBen: Is that your splinter in your mind?\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s my splinter, yeah.\\n\\nBen: Listeners who are new to the show, we\\'ve been iterating on how we end episodes. We decided on this recently of, how should we land the plane? It\\'s to talk about the thing that we can\\'t stop thinking about.\\n\\nDavid: This company\\'s 49 years old, and it\\'s still the most valuable company in the world.\\n\\nBen: Crazy. All right, David, I have some trivia for you.\\n\\nDavid: I love it. Trivia before carve outs.\\n\\nBen: Do you know where Dave Marquardt from TVI first encountered Bill Gates?\\n\\nDavid: No, I just assumed it was through Steve.\\n\\nBen: Dave had watched Bill present many years earlier at none other than the Homebrew Computer Club at Stanford, the very place that is part of the Apple lore with Jobs and Woz showing off the early Apple computer. Apparently, Bill also went and made a presentation there and would hang out there, and that is where Dave first came across him.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing. When we were talking about the letter that Bill writes to the hobbyist community decrying piracy and software, he\\'s basically writing it to the Homebrew Computer Club. He believed that those were the people who were ripping off his software.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s amazing. All right, carveouts?\\n\\nDavid: All right, carveouts. For new listeners, at the end of every episode, Ben and I just chat about one or two things that we\\'ve been enjoying personally lately that usually have nothing to do with the episode.\\n\\nIn my case, I have two. The first one has a lot to do with the episode. I have discovered/rediscovered the LGR YouTube channel. Are you into this Ben?\\n\\nBen: No.\\n\\nDavid: Clint and LGR, and it stands for Lazy Game Reviews, which I think is how it started, but then it became so much more, and now it\\'s just LGR. Clint is this awesome dude, and I think he lives in North Carolina. He is dedicated to basking in the glory, restoring, reliving, and preserving computer history, hardware and software from this era. The YouTube channel is all unboxing a Compaq PC from 1992 or restoring a Windows 3.1 machine.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s awesome.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s so good. He\\'s got the best, most soothing voice in the world. He just seems like such a nice dude. He\\'s dedicated to preserving the era of computing that we are talking about on this episode. It\\'s so fun.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s cool. It\\'s really hard because all hardware fails eventually. At some point, there will be zero computers out there that can run Windows 3.1 that will boot. The only way to experience any of these things is through an emulator. I don\\'t know. To be able to capture high-res footage and stuff of those machines while they still work, it\\'s cool.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, super cool. My other carve out is Andre 3000 from Outkast. Do you know what Andre 3000 is up to these days?\\n\\nBen: Not at all. No.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, my God. Okay. GQ just did a big interview with Andre 3000 because he just released a new album. This is not what you think. Andre, a lot of people say, consensus top five rappers of all time. Big Boi, his counterpart in Outkast, also great too, but they basically went out on top.\\n\\nThey did Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which was their double album. I think it came out 2004 maybe. I was a freshman in college.\\n\\nBen: Hey Ya was on that, right?\\n\\nDavid: Hey Ya, yeah, everything was on that. They did one more album, and then they stopped. Andre would be featured on some other rappers tracks over the years, but didn\\'t put out another album for close to 20 years. He just put out an album, and he just did this big video interview with GQ.\\n\\nThe album is a flute album. He got really into woodwind instruments. This has been his life. He reveals in the interview that he has put out other songs and other albums over the years under pseudonyms. This interview is so great. It\\'s so unexpected because the interviewer keeps asking, you\\'re Andre 3000, why\\'d you stop rapping? I don\\'t have anything to say. Am I going to rap about getting a colonoscopy? This is where my life is right now. I never wanted to put out any work that wasn\\'t both authentic and great. I didn\\'t have anything to say anymore.\\n\\nBen: Yup, I love that. If you ever heard the phrase, go out when the top row at the back of the auditorium is empty?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and that\\'s what they did. Idlewild which was the album that came out after Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, was great, but it wasn\\'t that, and yet that\\'s exactly what he did.\\n\\nBen: I think it\\'s a Seinfeld quote. I might misattribute it. Drop a note in the Slack if I did, but I think it\\'s a Seinfeld quote. \"You let one row be empty, but you don\\'t want to wait too long.\"\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, it\\'s the same thing as what Seinfeld did.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: Super fun. We\\'ll link to it in the show notes.\\n\\nBen: All right. I have three and they\\'re all different. We\\'ve had a tradition on the recent episodes of doing multiple carveouts, and all of them are different genres. My product that I\\'ve really been loving, my physical product is the Meta Ray-Bans.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. I was talking with the team at Meta about them. They\\'re doing great.\\n\\nBen: I bet. It\\'s a pretty delightful product. I bought them because I was in Hawaii and with my four month old son. We were in the pool and stuff. My iPhone\\'s waterproof, but I want a different angle, and I don\\'t necessarily want to be holding my phone. It\\'s very cool to be able to take pictures and record video of what I actually see to be able to relive that moment.\\n\\nI did a bunch of photos and video. We were on vacation that way, and then I discovered a thing that they\\'re actually just awesome for. I think even better than AirPods is phone calls. The speakers are great. I wouldn\\'t say necessarily they\\'re the best for listening to music. The bass is obviously not as good as headphone bass. They project the sound down toward your ears. Unless you\\'re standing really close to me, you can\\'t really hear, or unless I have the volume all the way up.\\n\\nThe microphones are great too. I was on a long walk on the beach with the wind whipping by on a call with my mom. I was like, does this sound really bad and distorted to you? She\\'s like, not at all. I was really impressed and we\\'ll definitely be using them for more calls. I think that style of headphone over the ear, there are many things that it\\'s not good for.\\n\\nWhen you\\'re on an airplane or something, you want to plug your ears, or if you\\'re in a super loud environment. But unless you\\'re in one of those environments, it\\'s a nice break for your ears versus having AirPods jammed in. It\\'s a great call experience. So they\\'re great.\\n\\nThe battery\\'s great. It\\'s a four-hour battery, so it\\'s a low key, more subtle, augmented reality experience. There\\'s no heads up display. You don\\'t see anything, but when you get a text message, it\\'ll read it to you.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s more than just the camera system.\\n\\nBen: Totally. It basically is you have AirPods in, but you don\\'t actually have AirPods in, and you have a pretty good photo video camera on your face.\\n\\nDavid: Does it have an indication when you\\'re taking photo or recording video?\\n\\nBen: Yes. It\\'s not super bright. I\\'m not sure everybody really knows when you are, but if you know what to look for, you know if it\\'s on or off.\\n\\nDavid: Cool.\\n\\nBen: I\\'ve been loving it. I think it\\'s a great product. I intend to wear them a lot this summer.\\n\\nMy second one is a thank you to a very, very good designer, Julia Rundberg, who worked with David and I on a recent project for some design work, some of which is actually featured as we speak on Apple podcasts. She did a bunch of other stuff with us, too, and she\\'s really excellent.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for someone who\\'s good at visual identity, branding, slide decks, websites, I\\'ve worked with her on a few projects before and she\\'s just awesome, so I wanted to recommend her.\\n\\nMy third is this community spotlight to go all the way back to nine years ago Acquired. It was a listener who runs a company called Summer Health reached out and said, I heard you say that you have a baby. I\\'ve got this great company that is for new parents, and here\\'s some info on it. I am now a paying member. It is an on-demand texting relationship with a pediatrician.\\n\\nDavid: Wow. This is crack for new parents.\\n\\nBen: It is crack for parents. It\\'s crazy. You can hook up multiple phones, so my wife and I both have a direct line to like, something weird is going on, will you help me through it? We had a 2:00 AM wake up the other night. Everything ended up being fine, but as I\\'m sure any other new parents can relate to, you really want to make sure in the middle of the night, if you\\'re not sure if everything\\'s fine, you would like to figure out the right steps to make sure everything\\'s fine. Having a virtual doctor on demand is totally amazing. Summer Health, if you are a new parent, we\\'ve been loving it.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing. I\\'m going to have to subscribe. We\\'ve referred to this before. I think this will probably be the last episode that comes out while I\\'m still the parent of just one child. Number two coming soon. If it may take a little longer than usual for the next Microsoft episode to come out, our next six-hour opus on Microsoft, don\\'t get too mad, that is the reason why.\\n\\nBen: We have a lot of thank yous on this one, as you can imagine. People were really generous with their time, pointing us to different resources, explaining their recollection of history as it happened. Being in Seattle, active in the venture community here, both through PSL and David, you\\'re in my shared history at Madrona, me working at Microsoft, a lot of good opportunities to learn what really happened from folks.\\n\\nA huge thank you to Mike Slade who spent the time with me. Mike spent two different stints at Microsoft and then at NeXT, and Apple in between.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, he worked for Steve at NeXT, right?\\n\\nBen: Yup. One of the few people in the world who both spent a ton of time with Steve, Bill, and worked closely with both of them. It\\'s so great to get his perspective, especially about the early days of Office and the applications group. Very helpful. Similarly, Pete Higgins worked closely with Mike. Pete, I think, ran Excel for a long time and oversaw a lot of the different stuff in the applications group, and I believe also ran Office.\\n\\nIt\\'s funny how many different people picked up the mantle over time as these things traded around groups. But frankly, I think that\\'s a huge part of the Microsoft story. The company very quickly adapted and changed its structure depending on the current needs of technology, competitors, and et cetera.\\n\\nHuge thanks to Tren Griffin, who is actually a lifelong Seattleite and close friend to the whole Gates family. Bill Gates Sr. was his mentor. I\\'m sure you\\'ve seen Tren\\'s prolific tweets online about Microsoft history. Actually, Tren I think currently works at Microsoft in a strategy role. Thanks Tren for your help as well. David, I know you\\'ve got a bunch.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Also, speaking of former Microsoft folks who are very active and prolific on Twitter, we talked to Steven Sinofsky who had lots and lots of great perspective, and we can\\'t wait to share more of it on the next episode.\\n\\nBen: I read 20 of Steven\\'s Hardcore Software posts. When David and I were dividing up what belongs in what episode, I realized 19 of them belong in next episode. Steven, thank you for your early prep work for part two.\\n\\nDavid: So much fun internet stuff to talk with that Steven was right there for. I spoke with other people who ran windows, Terry Myerson who\\'s a great friend and a supporter of the show. Terry ran Windows for quite a long time, right?\\n\\nBen: Yeah. When I was there, Terry was EVP over Windows and Windows Phone.\\n\\nDavid: Terry was very generous. He was actually the first person that clued us into just how key Steve\\'s role was in building the enterprise for Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: And how different the go to market motions were for Windows and Office. I think Terry was the one that gave us the insight of Windows, especially in the early days. It was basically an OEM game, small group doing an OEM thing.\\n\\nDavid: There were 10 people selling that.\\n\\nBen: And it\\'s still I don\\'t think a very big team even today.\\n\\nDavid: Speaking of strategy, Charles Fitzgerald, who\\'s OG in Microsoft and a great platform strategy guy, prolific angel investor in Seattle now, it\\'s fun chatting with him about the early days.\\n\\nBen: Obviously, Brad Silverberg who we mentioned a bunch. It was very fun seeing after spending some time talking with Brad and texting a lot with him to see the end of the Windows 95 announcement after Bill and Jay Leno are done for Brad to come out and finish it off. It\\'s fun. It\\'s like watching a time machine, watching that thing is really cool.\\n\\nSoma Somasegar at Madrona is someone that David and I love crossing paths with in the Seattle entrepreneurship ecosystem.\\n\\nDavid: Soma\\'s just such a legend at Microsoft and in the industry too. There\\'s so many people who Soma made their careers, plucked them out of school, saw something in them that maybe they didn\\'t even see in themselves, and then they went on to be big executives or venture capitalists at Microsoft or elsewhere.\\n\\nBen: Lastly, huge thank you to Steve Ballmer. To be honest, it was a little bit surreal chatting and hearing about his experience over the whole thing. There\\'s nobody including Bill Gates that bleeds Microsoft more than Steve Ballmer, and his just unabashed pure pride in what they built is infectious.\\n\\nDavid: Absolutely. It was so fun talking to Steve. He was so gracious with his time. It must have been just super special for you too. He was the CEO when you worked there.\\n\\nBen: Totally. To be frank, I had a very opposite strategy in mind, but I was a new hire out of college, individual contributor PM. It was still the Windows company then, and Steve was championing the Windows strategy, and I was a guy working on Office for iPad.\\n\\nWith that, our huge thank you to JP Morgan Payments, ServiceNow, and Pilot. You can click the link in the show notes to learn more about any of those great partners of Acquired.\\n\\nIf you like this episode, I was thinking of ones to recommend. It would be pretty funny to go listen to the forethought acquisition, given all of this context. It\\'s a short episode when David and I were not good at this yet, and we did our very best. It is from our early days, and it covers overlapping source material.\\n\\nDavid: Forethought was the company that made PowerPoint, Microsoft acquired, the first major acquisition for the company.\\n\\nBen: If you are new to the show and looking for great recent episodes that we\\'ve done, I highly recommend the Visa one as discussed earlier in the Network of Networks idea, if you haven\\'t heard that, or perhaps the Nintendo or NVIDIA episodes, all of which will be right up your alley if you liked this one.\\n\\nDavid: If you\\'re not at all interested in technology or software, but have somehow managed to get through all these hours with us, give a listen to our LVMH and Hermes episodes. Even if you do love technology and software, which obviously you do if you\\'re still here, there\\'s so much to learn from that world.\\n\\nBen: If you want to know every time an episode drops, get hints at the next episode topic, and get episode corrections and follow up, you can sign up at acquired.fm/email. Come discuss this episode with everyone else who\\'s chatting about it at acquired.fm/slack.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for another episode, go check out our second show, ACQ2, where we will have actually some very awesome tech CEO guests coming out over the next month or so that are absolutely worth listening to, especially if you\\'re interested in semiconductor and tech history. If you want some sweet Acquired merch, go to acquire.fm/store.\\n\\nWith that, listeners, we\\'ll see you next time.\\n\\nDavid: We\\'ll see you next time.\\n\\n', 'followups_and_corrections': \"Follow-Ups and Corrections:\\n\\n• The first GUI actually pre-dates Xerox PARC!

By accessing the Intel 386 processor’s “protect mode”, David was able to allow Windows apps to use the chip’s full 16MB of memory, instead of just the standard 1MB memory they otherwise would have had. This was absolutely essential to making Windows commercially and technically viable in the marketplace (and eventually led to it dominating OS/2, Mac, etc). (Thanks to Rob Glaser)\\n\\n• Windows 386 was a key bridge product that paved the way for Windows 3.0 and 3.1. Win386 leveraged one key feature of the 386 chip that wasn’t in the 286 – the ability to multitask multiple 8086 virtual machines, which allowed multiple DOS apps to stay active at the same time. This was a super valuable feature for several transitional years. (Thanks to Rob Glaser)\\n\\n• The competing OS from UCSD was actually called “UCSD p-System”, not Pascal. Pascal was and is a programming language that UCSD contributed heavily to. (Thanks to Brad Feld)\\n\\n• The DEC operating system originally written by Dave Cutler (and other DEC colleagues) was actually named VMS, not VAX. The whole machine/system was commonly called VAX. (Thanks also to Brad Feld)\\n\\n• The decision to have Excel be made for the Mac instead of the PC was a huge and very disruptive decision made by Bill personally. Excel (code named Odyssey at the time) was originally being developed for the PC. When Bill changed it, the team didn’t like it, and the head of the Odyssey team (Doug Klunder) decided to quit over that decision (but was persuaded to stay until Excel 1.0 shipped). (Thanks to Rob Glaser)\\n\\n• Bill Gates wasn’t the only key Microsoft person who donated to the University of Washington CSE department — Paul Allen also gave a huge amount, and the department today is actually named the “Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering”. The Ballmer family as also given large sums to the UW over the years.\\u200d\\n\\n\"}\n"

The company that put a computer on every desk and in every home. The company that invented the software business model. The company that so thoroughly and completely dominated every conceivable competitor that the United States government intervened and kneecapped it…  yet it’s STILL the most valuable company in the world today. This episode tells the story of Microsoft in its heyday, the PC Era. We cover its rise from a teenage dream to the most powerful business and technology force in history — the 20-year period from 1975 to 1995 that took Bill and Paul from the Lakeside high school computer room to launching Windows 95 alongside Jay Leno and the Rolling Stones. From BASIC to DOS, Windows, Office, Intel, IBM, Xerox PARC, Apple, Steve Jobs, Steve Ballmer… it’s all here, and it’s all amazing. Tune in and enjoy… Microsoft.‍\",\n",

How is it?\\n\\nBen: I really like it.\\n\\nDavid: Nice.\\n\\nBen: I think it is reductionist to call it country.\\n\\nDavid: I was appropriately enough listening to Start Me Up through the ages.\\n\\nBen: Of course you were. But I feel like a David Rosenthal move is that you might have been listening to Start Me Up whether we were doing Microsoft or not. That's a very squarely in your genre song.\\n\\nDavid: The Stones though, man, it's crazy. They're in their 70s–80s.\\n\\nBen: Amazing.\\n\\nDavid: Man, I hope we're in our 70s and 80s dancing on stage.\\n\\nBen: Season 126.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah.\\n\\nBen: All right, let's do it.\\n\\nDavid: Let's do it.\\n\\nBen: Welcome to season 14, episode 4 of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. I'm Ben Gilbert.\\n\\nDavid: I'm David Rosenthal.\\n\\nBen: And we are your hosts. We often remark that selling software is the best business model of all time. Today, finally, we tell the story of the company that created that business, Microsoft.\\n\\nDavid: Finally, we're 10 years into Acquired. We're finally doing it.\\n\\nBen: It's been daunting. We wanted to do it for a while, but it takes some chutzpah to tackle Microsoft.\\n\\nDavid: I'm so fired up. We're ready. It's time.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, Microsoft today is sprawling and massive. It is the world's most valuable company worth over $3 trillion. They have 49 years of history making software for consumers and enterprises, making hardware, gaming systems, gaming studios, Windows apps, iPad apps, Mac apps, operating systems, mobile operating systems, MP3 players, search engines, cloud computing, services on cloud computing, programming languages, development environments, and the list goes on. But it did not start out that way.\\n\\nToday, we will tell the story of the desktop software company. Before the enterprise, before IT, before the Internet, before being a trusted partner to governments around the free world, and really, before people even knew what to do with personal computers, this is the story of a bunch of ragtag geniuses in their 20s pushing what was possible. Welcome to Microsoft, the PC era.\\n\\nListeners, if you want to know every time an episode drops, you can get hints at the next topic and follow up. You can sign up at acquired.fm/email. Come talk about this episode with the community at acquired.fm/slack. If you want more from David and I, you should check out our second show, ACQ2, where we interview founders, investors, and experts often as a deeper dive into topics we cover on the main show. Before we dive in, we want to briefly thank our presenting sponsor, JP Morgan Payments.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, just how we say every company has a story, every company's story is powered by payments. JP Morgan Payments is a part of so many journeys from seed to IPO and beyond.\\n\\nBen: With that, this show is not investment advice. David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss and likely all of you if you hold any index funds, and the show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. David, where on earth do we start the Microsoft story?\\n\\nDavid: We're right down the middle on this one. We're going to start in 1955 in Seattle, Washington with the birth of Bill Gates III or Trey as he's known growing up. It's so confusing because his dad is the second, but he goes by Senior, and Bill is Junior/III/Trey. Bill is born in 1955 as the second of three children to Bill and Mary Gates. Bill Gates Sr. (his father), is from Bremerton, the Navy town just across the sound from Seattle, where he grows up in a family that owns and runs a furniture store there, a long way from the software king of the world here.\\n\\nBill Gates Sr./II, after high school, he joins the Army during World War II, serves during World War II, and then he goes, I presume on the GI Bill to the University of Washington, where he's the first member of his family to go to college. There he gets an undergrad and a law degree in four years, and then decides to stay in Seattle with his new family and become a practicing attorney.\\n\\nI say family because at the U-Dub, he meets and marries one Mary Maxwell. Mary, I don't know how to put it other than that she is a force. Mary's family had founded National City Bank, and her father was a senior executive at First Interstate Bank, which later became a big part of Wells Fargo. Mary, despite being the daughter of a successful business family in that day and age, was not cast aside like so many other daughters we've talked about on the show.\\n\\nBen: New York Times, Hermes, where it was passed to the son-in-law to continue to run the business. That was not the case with Mary Maxwell.\\n\\nDavid: No. After she graduates from the U-Dub, she becomes first the president of the Seattle Junior League. She starts joining nonprofit boards in Seattle as a very young woman. She joins the Seattle Symphony Board, the Chamber of Commerce, the Children's Hospital, the King County United Way. She's such a force on these boards that she starts getting asked by her fellow board members to join their company's boards too. The corporate boards were so impressed with her.\\n\\nFirst, she joins the board of First Interstate Bank, the bank that her family's a part of. Then she joins the board of Cairo Television in Seattle. She even ends up joining the Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Board.\\n\\nBen: That's right, part of the AT&T breakup.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Eventually, she joins the Board of Regents of the University of Washington and the entire national United Way board. She never works full-time in a corporate setting, but it is not an overstatement at all to say that Mary Gates became one of the most powerful business people in the Pacific Northwest, period.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely, and Bill Gates Sr. was the prominent attorney in the region, so it's quite the power couple.\\n\\nDavid: Ben, it's like you're reading my script here. Yes. We don't want to give Bill Sr. the short shrift here either. He becomes a superstar lawyer, and he becomes a co-founding partner of the firm Preston, Gates, and Ellis, which today, I didn't even realize until I dug in the research, that is K&L Gates today, one of the largest law firms in the world.\\n\\nAnother fun fact that you probably know about Bill Gates Sr., but we got to, this being Acquired, talk about. Do you know what corporate board he joined later in life?\\n\\nBen: I do not.\\n\\nDavid: Costco.\\n\\nBen: Of course, Bill Gates Sr., we should say too, basically galvanized the entrepreneurial community in Seattle. He started the tech alliance. He was a huge angel investor. He really did organize angel investors, people who want to put high risk capital to work into startups. His heart was there, obviously, through his law practice, long before Bill Gates III became the prodigy he became.\\n\\nDavid: Totally, and that's the point we want to land here. For young Bill, Trey growing up here, he is growing up in a pretty unique household. He would later talk about being 9 or 10 years old. Most nights at dinner at his house, there would be a CEO, a senator, a governor, or somebody who's just over for dinner, and Bill would sit there and absorb the business conversation. It's like the Hermes family, the Dumas family that we talked about in that episode. This whole thing makes me think of Paul, the main character in the Dune movies in the book. He's bred from birth to be this incredible business mind.\\n\\nBen: At age 13, with his best friend, who we will talk about very soon, he brought up the idea, I wonder what company I will be the CEO of when I grow up. What industry will I go after? What problems will I tackle? It wasn't a question of if, but which.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. It just turned out that He would be the CEO and founder of the biggest company in the biggest industry ever to exist. The other thing that we got to say about Bill growing up, he is insanely competitive. He did not and does not like to lose at anything. That is putting it mildly, whether it's sports, swimming, computers, school, or the classroom.\\n\\nThere's a quote in one of the books we read from a childhood friend of his who says, \\\"Everything Bill did, he did competitively and never simply to relax.\\\" I think this used to be more than today. There's this image of Bill Gates that he was a computer nerd, that he was this shy little skinny kid. The way he looks doesn't help this, but that is not the case at all. This guy had a competitive fire in him, I'm sure he still does like none other.\\n\\nBen: Both things can be true. He was the number one math student in the State of Washington. He was a nerdy kid, a brilliant kid, and also fiercely competitive. His childhood friend and co-founder of Microsoft, Paul Allen, would say about him, “You could tell three things about Bill Gates pretty quickly. He was really smart, he was really competitive, and he wanted to show you how smart he was. And he was really, really persistent.”\\n\\nDavid: That sounds about right. Famously, speaking of Paul and where Bill and Paul meet, when Bill is in seventh grade, his parents enroll him at the Lakeside School, which now I think is internationally famous because of Bill. It is a super rigorous college prep school, middle school, and high school. Bill ends up writing the scheduling software for class scheduling that he puts himself in the classes with all the girls. Funny.\\n\\nThis Bill, 13 years old, seventh grade, Lakeside, this is when it starts. Obviously, Microsoft doesn't start. But during that year, Bill is 13 years old, the Lakeside Mothers Club raises money to buy the school a teletype, connect it up, and rent computer time from a DEC PDP 10 that is located in downtown Seattle and owned by the branch office there of General Electric.\\n\\nProbably a bunch of you are like, I have no idea what any of those words mean, so we got to set some context. This is 1968, the Beatles, Vietnam, the Summer of Love. This is not the computer age.\\n\\nBen: 2001, A Space Odyssey had just come out.\\n\\nDavid: Nolan Bushnell has not founded Atari yet. Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore are only just leaving Fairchild Semiconductor to start Intel. Silicon Valley is still dominated by Lockheed. There is no such thing as a microprocessor.\\n\\nBen: The United States would land on the moon one year later.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. The way computing worked back then, it was basically still the ENIAC days. A computer meant two things. It either meant a massive room sized machine that had about the computing power of a calculator, or it meant a human. People talked about computers as humans. Have you ever seen the movie Hidden Figures about the black women who did the calculations?\\n\\nBen: Yes. Those women were the computers.\\n\\nDavid: They were called the computers, yes.\\n\\nBen: Because they would sit there and compute.\\n\\nDavid: This was a totally different era. The idea that a 13-year-old kid in this high school, this middle school would get access to share computer time, I can't imagine there are many other secondary schools in the country that were doing this.\\n\\nBen: This is a very early place to make the point. Microsoft is the result of tremendous intelligence, brilliant strategy, fierce competition, and an unbelievable amount of luck. Bill Gates was born in 1955, the same year as Steve Jobs, to come into adulthood just as the personal computer wave is starting.\\n\\nThe fact that he was at a middle school and had this much privilege, where he could get access to a PDP-10 at this point in his life to help him understand how important computers would become, there are dozens of people in America who are as well-situated as Bill is, and that might be overly generous.\\n\\nDavid: He and Paul got a sneak peek into the future there at Lakeside. It's funny, you said the personal computer era. We are so far away from the personal computer here. We got us at the stage. What is computing? I mentioned ENIAC and these room-sized things.\\n\\nComputers did not have screens. You didn't have cursors, you didn't have lights, you didn't have pixels. Everything was done on a teletype that looked like typewriters, and they were wired up remotely either in the same facility or what Lakeside is doing. You could be remote. It's almost the cloud today.\\n\\nBen: And it called over a phone line. That was the teletype.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Got wired over the phone line, hooked up to these mainframes. You typed commands into this teletype, and then the response came back over the phone line or over whatever cable from the mainframe. It got printed out on a spool of tape on the teletype. But this is power that normal 13-year-olds don't come anywhere near accessing.\\n\\nWhat is the computing market at this time? It is pretty much—we'll come back to the pretty much in a minute—100% dominated by IBM. IBM, Big Blue, Big Iron is what it was referred to, the products that they would produce, were the industry.\\n\\nBen: Ben Thompson has a fantastic quote on this. He has an article called, What is a Tech Company? And here's his comment. \\\"Fifty years ago, what is a tech company was an easy question to answer. IBM was the tech company, and everybody else was IBM's customers. That may be a slight exaggeration, but not by much. IBM built the hardware, at that time the System 360, They wrote the software, including the operating system and the application, and provided services including training, ongoing maintenance, and custom line of business software.”\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, System 360 was a line of solutions, I would say, offered by IBM. It consisted of the room-sized thing, the mainframe, the software, which was system 360, and the consulting and the implementation. You couldn't just call up UPS and forklift one of these things into a company and expect it to work. No, you got to operate this thing too.\\n\\nBen: Totally, it's like ASML machines. You don't just ship them off to TSMC and say, good luck making semiconductors. It's a full solution, full service thing. But an important thing that was also happening this year, 1968, was that IBM was undergoing some antitrust scrutiny over that huge bundle that I just told you about.\\n\\nDoesn't it smell antitrust? They do everything from the hardware to the software to the operating system, the service, the support. They are the whole market. They're starting to get concerned. Proactively, they unbundled hardware, software, and services. They started selling those separately for the first time, which was not a problem at first. What it did was it cracked the door for customers to say, oh, I can buy hardware from IBM and software from someone else? Other people were not exploiting this, but it was possible.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, interesting. It cracks the door for Microsoft 15–20 years later.\\n\\nBen: Yes, but this is where the seeds are sown of what is the exploitable opportunity when Bill Gates is ready to do something.\\n\\nDavid: Interesting. Back to the timing thing for Bill, Paul, and Microsoft. I mentioned when we were setting this up that there's something else to talk about here. IBM was facing a disruptive force at this moment, I think, probably for the first time in its history, certainly in the computing era of IBM's history, and that was the Digital Equipment Corporation or DEC. Noticed when we said earlier that Lakeside is renting computer time from the General Electric computer in downtown Seattle, I said it's a deck PDP-10. It's not an IBM product.\\n\\nWhat's DEC? They're the \\\"mini\\\" computer company. Mini meaning it was the size of a closet, not the size of a room. It's all relative. DEC had been started by this guy, Ken Olson from MIT.\\n\\nWhat they did, he had this brilliant insight that would play out over and over and over again in technology that I'm not going to go compete with IBM head on, I'm not going to make any act. I'm not going to make mainframes.\\n\\nBut computing has advanced enough that there's an opportunity to make something smaller, less powerful, more toy-like, and there's enough demand out there that I think they can find some new markets for people who will buy those types of computers and it’s smaller businesses. But in particular, it's branch offices of the big company.\\n\\nI am sure General Electric bought lots and lots and lots of IBM mainframes and products at their headquarters, but the GE field office in Seattle is not going to truck in a mainframe.\\n\\nBen: And in 1968, Seattle is a provincial little town. I'm standing here right now. It's a major city and a huge economy in the United States. But at the time, a podunk, forgotten, sleepy, faraway place.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Microsoft would go a long way to changing that over time.\\n\\nBen: We should say this is the classic low-end disruption playbook. This is what Clayton Christensen was talking about. Going from mainframe to mini computers, I'm going to make something that's worse for most things, but better for some new things that new customers and new markets are going to care a lot about. IBM's going to look at it and go, that can't do any of the things that are important to our customers. And that's exactly why it works.\\n\\nDavid: Specifically, why are they not going to care about it? I don't know exactly what an IBM mainframe system, System 360, 370, whatever cost. I'm imagining tens of millions of dollars all in total cost, maybe hundreds of millions of total dollars to run a system like that and buy it.\\n\\nThe first DEC machine, when it comes out, the PDP-1, a few years before this time, was priced at $120,000, so an order of magnitude, maybe two below a system that you would buy from IBM. Obviously still a long, long, long way from the personal computer. People are not buying these things for their houses, but GE will buy one for the field office in Seattle, or universities will buy them for research, for their students, for their professors.\\n\\nDEC creates a new market for computing. Bill, he's so studied in business history, the founder, Ken Olson is Bill's hero. He totally looks up to DEC and what DEC's done. The DEC and minicomputer UI is still the same as the mainframe. You're still using a teletype. There's no innovation in terms of what computing is or how you use it. It's just cheaper and more people have access to it.\\n\\nBack to Lakeside and the Mother's Club raising money for this access here for the school, Bill, remember, he's just started. He's in seventh grade, and Lakeside is a middle school in a high school. The high school is actually in a separate building. The computer room that gets installed with the teletypes was over in the high school, but Bill doesn't care. He gets exposed to it in a math class one day and he's like, oh, I'm hooked.\\n\\nHe goes over. He's hanging out with the high schoolers, teaches himself how to program, and pretty quickly he becomes known as one of the very best programmers there. He and three other kids form what they call themselves the Lakeside Programmers Group. One of his buddies who he forms it with is of course the high schooler or I think the 10th grader at the time, Paul Allen.\\n\\nBen: There is a fantastic photo, listeners, that we will tweet of Bill and Paul sitting in the computer room at Lakeside. Bill, I think he's 13–14. He looks like he's about eight. I think on the wall, there's this almost printed out magazine thing that says the bug slayer that they've hung up over the wall. It's amazing.\\n\\nDavid: These high school kids, they start the Lakeside Programmers Group. They call it the programmers group because they are programmers. This is another super important thing to learn. To use a computer at this time meant to be a programmer. There was no package software that you bought. The software that IBM was selling was the operating system to make the machines actually function, and it was the programming languages that you could then program on but you weren't clicking around and using Excel or pulling up apps. Everybody who used a computer wrote their own software.\\n\\nBen: Right. There was not this multi-sided network of you've got developers making applications, and then you've got users of those applications. No, everybody who used a computer was a programmer.\\n\\nDavid: The goal of the Lakeside Programmers Group, remember Bill is this business prodigy, is to use their very valuable and very rare skills as programmers at this time to make money, do a business.\\n\\nIt turns out at the same time—the coincidences here are just crazy—there is a local startup coming out of the University of Washington called the Computer Center Corporation or C-Cubed. The business plan behind C-Cubed was that they were going to get a bunch of DECs, a bunch of PDP-8s, PDP-10s, PDP-11s, whatever, and they were going to be AWS. They were going to just be a computer time-sharing company.\\n\\nC-Cubed hires the Lakeside Programmers Group, these kids, to come in and find and document bugs in the system. They're going to pay them directly in computer time. When they come into C-Cubed, they learn Fortran, they learn Lisp, they learn machine language for the PDPs. Back at Lakeside, they were just using BASIC, the programming language.\\n\\nBen: Which is reasonably high level in terms of how abstract it is. You're not writing machine language. You don't have to know how to address memory, registers, and all that. It reads English, it knows how to add numbers together. It's not an elegant language, and it's a very verbose language. But if you look at it with your eyes as a person who speaks English and knows basic math, you're like, I understand what this program does. There's a meaningful amount of translation done by a BASIC interpreter that takes you from the BASIC code you have to write to what is actually running on the machine.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, but BASIC, we don't want to give the impression that it is just basic or just for kids.\\n\\nBen: No, it's widely used.\\n\\nDavid: It's going to become hugely, hugely important. It is both the gateway programming language for everybody, but it's a real programming language, and a lot of stuff is done in it.\\n\\nBen: It's the Python of its day. I think the way Python is now where you joke that Python is so flexible, you can accidentally write a program by writing English, it can forgive a lot of mistakes, and it reads English, it's a reasonable parallel to draw it way back when with BASIC where you say, look, you can understand it as a layman, but also it's used in a broad set of business applications.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. When Bill, Paul, and their buddies come into C-Cubed, they're now getting access to learn real hardcore systems programming languages, including machine code for the PDP-10. They're becoming pretty prolific engineers here.\\n\\nBen: They're handwriting assembly code.\\n\\nDavid: And they're getting mentored. One of the executives at C-Cubed is a guy named Steve Russell. Did you find this, Ben? Do you know about this?\\n\\nBen: No.\\n\\nDavid: This is amazing. You're going to die. Steve Russell was the guy who wrote Spacewar when he was at MIT on the first PDP, the PDP -1. He's a computer science legend.\\n\\nBen: Nolan Bushnell told us about that.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Spacewar was the first video game, first computer game ever written. It was written as a fun side project by some MIT engineers in the early days of DEC, and then that became Nolan Bushnell's inspiration for starting Atari and Pong. Steve Russell, that guy, he mentored Bill Gates.\\n\\nBen: Wow, and he was here at the University of Washington?\\n\\nDavid: He had come out to the University of Washington, and then left and was part of one of the execs starting this company.\\n\\nBen: C-Cubed, wow. That's a mile from my house.\\n\\nDavid: Right? Crazy.\\n\\nBen: Wow.\\n\\nDavid: After a little while at C-Cubed, all of this real expertise that these kids are getting leads to another opportunity at another timeshare computing company based down in Portland. They ask the kids to write a real piece of software, to write a payroll billing program for all their clients that are using the timeshare system.\\n\\nBill now, who's the de facto leader of this group, negotiates a deal with the help of his dad, Bill Gates Sr. prolific corporate attorney in Seattle. Rather than just being paid hourly for their time, they're going to get a royalty on the revenue that their client makes off the software. I can't believe it. These kids are teenagers. They're figuring out the whole software business model here.\\n\\nThey end up making at least $10,000 from these royalties, which the average household income in the US at the time was below $10,000. These kids are rolling in money. The next year, Paul graduates from Lakeside and goes off to college at Washington State. He and Bill decide to team up on a new venture that they're going to do together called Traf-O-Data.\\n\\nBen: They've identified a market opportunity, and that opportunity is reducing traffic.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. The business plan is that municipalities count cars that go through intersections, use that to make decisions about how they're going to do city planning. Bill and Paul are like, we can take this new thing that's coming out of Intel, a microprocessor, which is promising to be a full computer on one chip. We can use that. We can build a machine that is going to be a computer, and it'll process and analyze that data, and then we can sell it to governments. Great, big market.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, are you sensing what's happening here? Mainframe, mini computer, microprocessor. We have to keep using smaller and smaller words to represent the fact that the computer is getting smaller and smaller here.\\n\\nDavid: It wasn't until we started doing research for this episode that I finally realized, oh, microcomputers, which is the original term for the personal computer for the PC. It was called microcomputers before PC caught on. They're called microcomputers because they're based on the microprocessor.\\n\\nBen: Yes, absolutely.\\n\\nDavid: It's not just that micro is smaller than mini.\\n\\nBen: It is funny that it stopped there. The computers that are sitting on all of our desks are microcomputers.\\n\\nDavid: Right. While they're waiting for the AD08, this new first microprocessor from Intel, to come out, or at least for them to get access to it, they want to get a head start on programming their traffic data machine and programming this microprocessor. Paul's like, I got this. I can find a way to make this happen.\\n\\nHe takes the PDP-10 at Washington State and he writes a whole emulator program to mimic the instruction set for the AD08 from the manual. They get a full emulator up and running, and they can code even without the microprocessor actually being there. It's just NVIDIA. When Jensen was like, no, we got to build an emulator and simulate this, and then we're going to ship it sight unseen, they're doing the same thing.\\n\\nBen: It's funny. In many ways, at this point in history, getting a manual was actually much more valuable than getting the processor itself because the processor would arrive. Unless there was documentation, you would have no idea how to interact with it to take advantage of its power.\\n\\nIf you had a manual, sure, you couldn't actually test the stuff you wrote for it on the hardware. But if you wrote an emulator on a bigger, more powerful computer that could mimic the computer that you're actually targeting, you could go years before actually ever running the software on the target device and just work off of what the manual says as long as the manual is correct and matches how it actually works.\\n\\nDavid: And this is going to become very important to Microsoft in just a second. Traffic data is not a huge success. I think I read a few places, they make about $20,000 in revenue from it. Again, great money for high school and college kids, but not world-changing stuff here. This is not what Bill aspires to for the company he's going to start.\\n\\nBill and Paul are getting experience with the microprocessor. Bill actually has the idea for Microsoft when they're working with it. He's like, oh, this is a computer, why don't I go off and write an interpreter for BASIC here, and we can sell the BASIC interpreter for the microprocessor and build a big business? The AD08 just wasn't powerful enough yet to do that.\\n\\nBen: But spoiler alert, that totally becomes Microsoft. The seeds of Microsoft are selling language interpreters for new processors, new hardware, new computers that enable you to write familiar programming languages on that new hardware.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Bill and Paul are not the only ones having this insight here, too. Another Seattle guy named Gary Kildall who they had intersected with, who they knew from C-Cubed and the University of Washington, had the same idea here. We're going to bring up Gary and his company, Digital Research, a little bit later.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, he cared a little bit less about programming languages and a little bit more about operating systems. That's how they diverged for the few years here.\\n\\nDavid: Bill and Paul absolutely see the vision for what this can grow into and become. Bill has a great quote. \\\"Paul and I had talked about the microprocessor, and it was really his insight that because of semiconductor improvements, things would just keep getting better. I said to him, oh, exponential phenomena are pretty rare, pretty dramatic. Are you serious about this? Because this means, in effect, that we can think of computing as free. It was a gross exaggeration, but it was probably the easiest way to understand what it means to cut costs like that. And Paul was quite convinced of it.\\\"\\n\\nBen: Is this in the Smithsonian interview?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, so good.\\n\\nBen: It's so good. This quote is incredible because basically, Paul Allen brings up Moore's Law to Bill Gates; they don't use that language there. But in 1971, that is what's happening. For Paul, this is just an observation of hey, there's an exponential thing happening here, it seems like it's going to keep happening, it's been happening.\\n\\nBill's shaking and he's like, what? Exponential phenomena don't just happen. That's incredibly, incredibly rare and immediately gets Bill's wheels turning on. What does this mean for the world? If that's actually true, we need to act and do something profoundly different than anyone's ever done before because this enables new things that no one ever thought could be possible.\\n\\nDavid: This moment is the genesis of the vision for Microsoft. Even though Bill doesn't say the words in this quote, the vision of a computer on every desk in every home, that's the famous part that got left off later when the DOJ started sniffing around was running Microsoft software.\\n\\nBut that is the vision here, and it is crazy at the time. A computer on every desk and in every home, Bill sees that this is what this exponential phenomenon, what Moore's law means, that that is going to happen. We're still in the era of teletypes. Nobody else sees this.\\n\\nBen: And it's also the reason why Microsoft is going to form into such a different type of company that's ever come before it, why they can break all the rules, why they can sell just software, even though that's never been a thing before, why their business model can be so much different than everyone else's business model.\\n\\nIn preparing for this episode, we got to talk with Pete Higgins, who ran Excel and was an executive overseeing Office for a long time in the early days. He had this great quote to us, which was, \\\"Computer on every desk was wackadoo stuff. People laughed at it. It was absolutely wild. People thought, I don't know, maybe 1 in 10 people in their finance group or something will have one at some point. This is the profoundness of an exponential decrease in price or increase in power of computing. It's going to become universal.\\\"\\n\\nDavid: All that said, even Bill and Paul know the AD08. It's not there yet. It's not powerful enough to really be a general-purpose computer on a chip, but they know it's coming. In the fall of 1973, Bill goes off to college at Harvard famously. It's funny, at Harvard, like Jim Simons that we talked about at MIT on the RenTech episode. Bill thinks he's going to be a world-class mathematician and set the world on fire.\\n\\nBen: It's literally a quote from Paul Allen. Bill was the number one math student in the state of Washington. He gets there, and he does this theoretical math class, math 55 and gets a B. Paul says, when it came to higher mathematics, he might've been one in a hundred thousand or better, but there were people who were one in a million or one in 10 million. And some of them wound up at Harvard. Bill would never be the smartest guy in the room, and I think that hurt his motivation. He eventually switched his major to applied math.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. While Bill's at Harvard, he's also doing a bunch of the typical college kid stuff. He's playing poker, he's cutting classes, he's making friends. One of the friends he makes there is a kid down the hall from him named Steve Ballmer. Everybody knows Ballmer. He's everything that Bill is not. He's super social, he's super outgoing. He's in a final club, which is a big thing in the social scene at Harvard.\\n\\nBen: He's gregarious. Anyone who's ever met Steve or seen a video of Steve, you are well aware that this man has a presence. But the thing that people don't know about him is he is so unbelievably analytical. Steve is the guy that outscored Bill Gates on the Putnam exam.\\n\\nDavid: Which is the annual math competition for college students.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, Steve isn't a programmer, but he is every bit the mathematician that Bill Gates is. That is one of these things where I think when people try to set it up as well, you've got the brilliant programmer genius and the marketing guy, it's just like those are the roles they took. But I think when you're getting a sense of who the original crew was at Microsoft, they were all brainiacs, and they were all wildly analytical.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. In the spring of 1974, Bill's freshman year, Electronics Magazine publishes big news about a new Intel chip, the next generation, the next turn of the crank on Moore's Law, the 8080. In Bill's words here, all at once, we were looking at the heart of a real computer, and the price was under $200. We attacked the manual. I told Paul, DEC can't sell any more PDP-8s now. It seemed obvious to us that if a tiny chip could get so much more powerful, the end of big unwieldy machines was coming.\\n\\nBen: Yup. This is really where Bill Gates commits to computers to be his life's work. I think what's often lost in the story is Bill, even though he was good at computers and spent tons of time programming computers, never fancied himself a computer guy until this moment in history. He went to Harvard because he felt, hey, if I ever want to be a lawyer or something else, they've got a lot of great programs there. This was the moment where I think it really clicked for him that I'm just in the middle of the right place at the right time with the right skill set, and this is my way of having the most impact on the world.\\n\\nDavid: They think, okay, what's clearly going to happen here is all the big computer companies, IBM, DEC, the big Japanese computing companies, they see this. They're going to get into this business, they're going to make machines, and they're going to make microcomputers. Surely, they will jump on this opportunity, right?\\n\\nBen: If it didn't destroy their existing business model, sure they would.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Bill and Paul are sitting around waiting through 1974 and 1975 being like, hey, when are the 8080 computers going to come out? Where are they? It's just crickets. Paul is so convinced that the revolution is coming that he actually drops out of Washington State, moves to Boston to be close to Bill so that they can be ready when it happens. That summer, they both get summer jobs at Honeywell as programmers. Paul stays on into the next school year when Bill goes back to school. He's just waiting, waiting, waiting.\\n\\nIn December 1974, Paul is walking across Harvard Square, and he sees in a newsstand the January issue of Popular Electronics, on whose cover is the Altair 8800, the world's first real honest-to-God commercially available for sale microcomputer. The legend has it that Paul grabs the magazine, runs over to Bill's dorm, throws open the door, throws the magazine on the desk, and is like, it's here. Bill's just says, oh, my God, it's happening without us. We need to get on this right now.\\n\\nBen: It's so funny he thinks they're already behind because clearly they're not. History would show. I think Bill Gates even says, we might've actually started a year or two too early. The market actually hadn't materialized yet. The funniest thing is, the starting gun went off, Bill and Paul ran, and everyone else is still standing around.\\n\\nDavid: This is it. This is the moment. The revolution is here. Microsoft is about to be founded. But first, this is a great time to thank our presenting partner this season, JP Morgan Payments.\\n\\nBen: Just like Bill's vision of Microsoft to put a computer on every desk and in every home, JP Morgan has a vision for making payments real time, 24/7 everywhere and in every currency. JP Morgan has experienced a massive digital transformation, and is now much more than just a global bank. They invest $15 billion a year into technology and R&D. With JP Morgan Payments, you are getting their history of service, stability, and scale, but also innovation and new technology.\\n\\nDavid: Scale is really the key word here. Every episode, we talk about Hamilton Helmer's seven powers, and boy, does JP Morgan have scale economies. What's unique about their position in payments is that they can make massive infrastructure investments that benefit their customers in the near term, in addition to the long-term technology bets like blockchain or quantum computing. Since they move $10 trillion a day in 160 countries, these investments create a lot of shared value across their large customer base.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, not to mention the second of the Seven Powers' network economies.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. If you're a JP Morgan payments customer, whether you're a startup or a Fortune 500, you can access their payments partner network. This is a set of third party integrations across virtually every industry and payment use case. It makes it easy to discover what specific set of tools are best for your business.\\n\\nBen: It's basically a B2B marketplace that connects their clients with the broader payments and technology ecosystem such as treasury management systems, ERPs, point of sale hardware solutions, payment gateways, and so much more. Given JP Morgan's scale, you can imagine the value that comes with unlocking access to their industry leading partners and technology.\\n\\nDavid: Let's take Visa, for example, which listeners may remember. We talked a lot on that episode about the power of a network. Visa works with JP Morgan to provide global payment processing services. Now through the partner network, you can easily add Visa as an acceptance method through a streamlined implementation with consolidated reporting. Other companies in the partner network include Oracle, American Express, MasterCard, Accenture, and many more including friends of the show, Modern Treasury.\\n\\nBen: Across any industry, the most successful companies we've talked about are the ones who think and invest strategically through a long-term lens. Like Hermes, durability and reliability are paramount for building hundred year companies that can reinvent and continue to grow. That is the case for JP Morgan Payments. Their history of trusted solutions and investments in technology bring clients and new fintech companies together to drive innovation and growth for businesses of all sizes.\\n\\nDavid: Before we jump back into Bill and Microsoft, who essentially wrote the modern playbook on building platforms, be sure to check out jpmorgan.com/acquired or click on the link in the show notes.\\n\\nBen: David, they're like, it's happening without us. What do they do?\\n\\nDavid: They do the natural thing that two super excited, ambitious, high octane college kids would do. They call up the main phone number of Altair's manufacturer, a company called MITS and ask for the president, a man named Ed Roberts. Bill and Paul get them on the phone and they say, we have a BASIC interpreter, ready to go, ready to ship, for the 8080 Intel chip, and we want to provide it for you, for your machine.\\n\\nBen: Of course they don't.\\n\\nDavid: They don't have a single letter of code written. They don't have anything.\\n\\nBen: It's a market test. They want to know what's the response if this were true.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Ed's a bit of a character himself. He says, okay, well, guys, a lot of other people are calling me and saying the same thing. What I'm telling them, and I'm going to tell you too, is that anybody who can come here to my office in Albuquerque, New Mexico and demonstrate a working version of BASIC on my Altair will get a contract with us to distribute it when they go on sale. Bill and Paul say, okay, great, we'll see you soon, and hang up. By ‘see you soon,’ they mean, ‘let's go get to work.’\\n\\nBen: This is a big deal for MITS too if this works, because right now they've just announced a machine for which you can't really do anything on it. The hardware is powerful, but they're not going to have a lot of customers unless there's stuff you can do on the machine. A BASIC interpreter running on it, it's quite valuable to then make the claim you can program BASIC on our computer. They're very excited about this, even though they're playing coy.\\n\\nDavid: I was going to talk about this in a minute, but let's talk about what the Altair is. What did they just announce in the magazine here? The Altair is the first mass market commercially available personal computer.\\n\\nBen: Again, no screen or anything.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Does not have a screen, does not have a keyboard, doesn't have a display of any kind. What it does have is it has a set of 16 lights on the front of the machine, Christmas lights and 16 switches. You can flip the switches to flip bits, and then the machine will respond by lighting up different patterns of lights. It doesn't come with any software. There's nothing. That's all it is, 16 lights, 16 switches.\\n\\nBen: In order to use it, you got to hook up your own teletype, you got to get the manual, you got to hope that the manual is right, and you got to code to the machine instructions, literally the assembly language for the chip inside for the Intel 8080.\\n\\nDavid: Back to the Traf-O-Data days and Paul writing the emulator for the 8008 at Washington State, Paul's like, we got this. I'll just write an emulator on the Harvard PDP-10 for the 8080 instruction set.\\n\\nBen: He does the same thing again. They get the manual, they have an emulator, and they write it against an emulator.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Bill writes the BASIC interpreter. In a couple of weeks, they've got it working. Ed's like, okay, come on out to Albuquerque. Bill and Paul—remember, Bill still looks he's 12 at this point in time—decide that just Paul should go.\\n\\nBen: Does Paul have a rocking beard at this point yet?\\n\\nDavid: Paul is super 70s. He is into it. As we'll see, he's going to fit right in at Albuquerque and MITS. Paul gets on a plane, flies from Boston to Albuquerque. In a total epic legend moment, they didn't have a bootloader written for the BASIC interpreter.\\n\\nThey had the BASIC, it was all written, they'd done it on the emulator, and Paul's flying out with the computer tape with the code of the BASIC interpreter on it. He's like, oh, shoot, we can't just feed that right into the machine. There's got to be a bootloader to load up this thing. He writes the bootloader on the plane.\\n\\nBen: On paper, by hand, he is hand coding octal, not even assembly language instructions. He's hand coding in pure octal the instructions to load their BASIC interpreter program into memory.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. He lands in Albuquerque, drives out to MITS. They load the bootloader onto the prototype Altair there that loads up the BASIC interpreter, and it fails. It doesn't work. Paul's like, oh, shoot, let's try it again. Let's try it again. They try it again. This is how early computing is. It works the second. Who knows what the bug was the first time. They didn't change anything, it just didn't work the first time, and it worked the second time.\\n\\nIt loads up, Paul writes in the instructions, print two plus two. It spits out four—by spits out, I mean the lights light up and say four. Both he and Ed, their jaws are on the floor. Paul's like, oh, my God, the BASIC works. Ed's like, oh, my God, the Altair works. Neither of them believed this was actually going to work.\\n\\nBen: Ed actually has more eggs in this basket than he let on because when Bill and Paul call and say, hey, can you give us the teletype instructions, he reveals they're actually the only ones who called about that. Everyone else who said they were writing a BASIC never got far enough to ask, how do we actually interact with your computer?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Now is the time to say a few words about Ed and MITS. What is this company? Bill and Paul originally thought that it was going to be the IBMs, the DECs, the Japanese companies who are going to make the first microcomputers. MITS is about as far away from IBM as you can possibly imagine. MITS basically was a model rocket company.\\n\\nBen: Which, Albuquerque is a great place to do that.\\n\\nDavid: Ed Roberts, the founder, had been in the Air Force and stationed in Albuquerque. That's how he got involved in model rocketry. The reason that they're introducing the Altair and they made this big Splash in the magazine was this is a last ditch gambit to try and save the company. You got a bankrupt model rocketry company.\\n\\nBen: Their little gambit worked and got a couple of college kids to pounce.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Why did it work? They had two things going for them that really, Ed, I think probably personally made happen. (1) They got this splashy popular electronics magazine cover that was through a relationship that Ed had. (2) The sticker price was $397, which is about $2300 in 2024 dollars. Yes, that's a lot of money, but the next cheapest computer that anybody could buy at this point in time was a DEC, a $120,000 mini computer. The idea that somebody could buy a computer for $400, I don't care who's selling that thing, I want that.\\n\\nBen: What did they get, some sweet deal from Intel?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This is all Ed's doing. The list price from Intel for the 8080 chip was $360. I think this is part of what was deterring the market of how would anybody sell a kit that was affordably priced when so much of the cost of goods would go to Intel with the processor deal. He managed to negotiate a volume deal with Intel to get 8080 chips at $75 a pop. That was the key unlock.\\n\\nBen: That's a 5X price reduction.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I wasn't able to find how that negotiation went down or why Ed Roberts in Albuquerque, New Mexico got this sweetheart deal from Intel.\\n\\nBen: Either the list price is wildly wrong, or they were cutting deals all over the place. One thing it could have been is just that, and I'm totally speculating, but chips are the ultimate high fixed cost investment, low marginal costs next to software.\\n\\nYou could imagine maybe Intel had already put all the money into the fixed costs of spinning up the fabs and was expecting a certain amount of market demand, and they weren't seeing it. They were like, crap, we've got to recoup our investment. I don't know, lower the price, let them just sell. Maybe we'll make it up in volume.\\n\\nDavid: I like that. I have no idea, but that's a totally viable train of thought here. Either way, he gets the sweetheart deal. Not only does it make computer history and enable and create Microsoft, it saves the company of MITS.\\n\\nThey were on the edge of bankruptcy. After the popular electronics article comes out, they get 4000 pre-orders in the first month or two, which is $1.5 million in revenue, cash paid upfront. That is pure cash hitting the bank account.\\n\\nBen: That will save a company.\\n\\nDavid: And also just proves 4000 people just paid cash sight unseen for 16 lights and switches. There's a lot of demand for a home computer here.\\n\\nBen: At decent margins too, if they're getting the processor for $72, and they're selling it for what did you say?\\n\\nDavid: $397.\\n\\nBen: Everything else in there is much cheaper than the processor, so I don't know. Depending on how much they have to give to the sales channel they're selling through, if it's retail or distributors.\\n\\nDavid: I think they're selling direct. I think people are just sending money orders.\\n\\nBen: It's a decent margin business. Unlike what the PC business would become over time, they managed to have nice margins.\\n\\nDavid: Paul and Ed hit it off. Paul decides to move out to Albuquerque to be close to the action here. He actually joins MITS as their vice president of Software. He's vice president of a software department of one. He is the software department here.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, software department of one, but he's got his buddy Bill Gates who is not employed, but Bill's definitely working on software for the Altar as well.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Bill stays at Harvard, but keeps cranking on enhancing the BASIC interpreter and adding more functions and functionality to the version of BASIC that they had just written for the Altair. Once the school year is over, he comes out to Albuquerque for the summer.\\n\\nThe Altair is getting ready to ship with the Microsoft BASIC included in it. Bill and Paul need to set up a company, but Paul is an employee of MITS at this point, so what did they do? They set up a partnership. The founding of Microsoft, at this point Micro-Soft, is a two-person partnership between Bill and Paul.\\n\\nBen: As we record this, that was 49 years and one day ago. We are sitting here on April 5th recording. That was April 4th, 1975. It is very funny to look back at some of the original signatures when Bill writes on letters. It's Bill Gates, the general partner of Micro-Soft, which is great. I think it's actually a Paul Allen name where he wants to put together microcomputer and software. Bill's like, that's perfect, we're immediately just going to run with it. As it was a partnership, originally, they were going to call it something like Allen and Gates, and then they ultimately are like, no, Micro-Soft is perfect.\\n\\nDavid: Microsoft has become Kleenex. Microsoft means microprocessor software.\\n\\nBen: I will say it's a nice clarifying North Star because it really draws the line in the sand and says, we're in the software business. Gates makes this really clear to Paul Allen, who is often tempted to do hardware stuff. Bill is very hardcore about saying, no, what we're uniquely good at in the world is software and we should stick to that.\\n\\nI also suspect Bill is starting to realize that there's an amazing business model here if we can pull it off, where we don't have to make the hardware, and we can charge for every copy of the software sold. But that insight, I would say, has not yet fully materialized.\\n\\nDavid: Let's talk about business model here in one sec. First though on the partnership. Again, we've been saying all along that Bill is clearly the leader here. They set up the partnership. Initially, it's 60/40 ownership, Bill is 60%, Paul is 40%. Later, it gets changed to Bill is 64% and Paul is 36%. Yup, Bill is the leader here.\\n\\nBen: Bill's case that he makes on that to Paul is, hey, you took a job and you were doing this on the side, I was all in. Paul's an agreeable guy, and 36% is still a nice percent, so he says, sure.\\n\\nDavid: In the long run here, everybody gets nuts. It's all a rounding error, but to that point back to the business model. Once the partnership is set up, they sign an exclusive licensing arrangement with MITS. This is super important. This is a big lesson that young Bill and Paul are going to learn here.\\n\\nMITS gets exclusive license to the BASIC interpreter to the BASIC as they call it for the 8080. MITS is the one that can then decide whether to sublicense the BASIC out to other companies or not.\\n\\nEssentially, this is a distribution deal with MITS, where MITS becomes the exclusive seller and distributor of Microsoft's BASIC. Microsoft doesn't have any direct sales control here, and it's going to become a big, big, big issue. The terms of the deal are Microsoft is to get $30 for each copy of BASIC that MITS sells plus 50% of the revenue that comes from the sublicensing deals that MITS may or may not do with other companies who want to use the BASIC.\\n\\nBen: Why would they ever do any sublicensing deals? Why would you give it to your competitors?\\n\\nDavid: That is a really good question, Ben.\\n\\nBen: Let's just round that part of the revenue to zero.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. This is a big, big, big divergence of interest between Microsoft and MITS. The kicker on this contract is that the total amount of lifetime revenue that Microsoft can make from the BASIC from MITS is capped at $180,000. Ed admits really has the upper hand in this deal.\\n\\nBen: Or phrased another way, we will give you $180,000 for you to hand over exclusive rights to all that cool BASIC stuff you just wrote to us. But if we sell fewer than X machines, we're actually going to pay it out to you on a prorated basis at $30 a pop rather than giving you the full $180,000.\\n\\nDavid: That is another way to frame it. Definitely, a great deal for MITS. On the other hand, what are Bill and Paul going to do here?\\n\\nBen: Right, a great deal for them too given the position they're in.\\n\\nDavid: Right, MITS is the industry. There is one very, very important clause in the contract though, protecting Microsoft's interests. That clause is that MITS must use its best efforts to license, promote, and commercialize the BASIC broadly in the marketplace. Any failure to do so by MITS would be grounds for termination of the contract by Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: Thank God, Bill's dad is a lawyer.\\n\\nDavid: Indeed. The Altair comes out for sale later in 1975. Microsoft does $16,000 in revenue that year from their $30 a pop, the BASICs that are getting sold with the Altair, which is great, especially the first year that they're starting.\\n\\nThe next year in 1976, everybody's so excited about this new market, the vision that's happening, the demand, the Altair, the sales that Paul Allen resigns from MITS to join Microsoft full-time. Bill drops out of Harvard officially. He moves to Albuquerque. They're all in on this. But for the year in 1976, Microsoft's revenue is still only $22,000. It was $16,000 the year before, $22,000 in 1976.\\n\\nBen: Not a high growth company.\\n\\nDavid: This is less than they were making in high school. What is going on here? (1) MITS is the one at the controls of sales, not Microsoft. (2) MITS is selling a thousand computers a month. This is taking off. This is creating a new industry. Despite MITS selling thousands of computers a month, only a few hundred copies of BASIC are selling per month. What's going on? People are pirating the software. This is the discovery of software piracy.\\n\\nBen: This is a pretty interesting time to pause and say, are they pirating software?\\n\\nDavid: That's a good question.\\n\\nBen: This is 1975. Piracy implies that you are running afoul of some particular legal protection for the good. You might say, well, with today's legal frameworks in hindsight, you would say, of course, if they're copying the software and not paying the money for it, it's piracy. That was actually not established yet. This is the craziest thing. Bill basically has an opinion that it's piracy, and he writes letters to the computer community.\\n\\nDavid: He writes an open letter to hobbyists.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and tries to basically guilt trip people. He tries to use that as a recruiting method and say, if you're so excited about pirating our software, maybe you should just come work with us. Nothing would make me happier than making the best software in the world, and please join us on this mission. But ultimately, the legal standing that he has to say, hey, what you're doing is illegal, is not fully established.\\n\\nIt would actually take a couple of years for the courts to look at software and say, what about this is protectable? If you think about it, it is a little bit weird. You've got source code that looks like English, BASIC, it's letters and numbers. It gets translated to machine code. That machine code ends up running, and it's basically electrons. It's voltages that are flipped up and down. What about that are we trying to protect?\\n\\nUltimately, the way it gets litigated through some case law from court cases is that the source code is a copyrightable, creative work that is expressed through some tangible medium. That's the important thing about copyright law. It's a creative work expressed through a tangible medium. A book, the creative work is the words and the tangible medium is printed on paper.\\n\\nWith software, it actually took until 1980. Congress changed the law. We'll put a link in the show notes to the literal congressional change that happened. It is in Title 17, Copyrights Chapter 1, Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright. In 1980, they include a defined term, which is a \\\"computer program is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.” Once you have that passed by Congress codified into law, you now have the standing legal framework that all the whole computer industry used going forward, in particular, the software industry, a computer program is copyrightable work.\\n\\nDavid: Wow, I didn't know all, that's awesome.\\n\\nBen: It's totally crazy how recent that is. But when you think about it, why would that have any legal…? Software is such an abstract idea. Before, the whole business model of computers was good luck just replicating an IBM PC and everything that comes with it. You don't need any legal standing. But if you're going to pursue this software only business model, what's the protection around your abstract product?\\n\\nDavid: That's exactly what I was going to say here. This is the other element of what's going on. This is the first time software has ever been sold. Other than the IBM accounting machinations to protect themselves from antitrust, which was just accounting, nobody had ever sold software before. This is the first time.\\n\\nBen: Certainly to build a legitimate business around it. The other thing that's useful to know is when you're selling an IBM PC, you're literally selling a PC to a customer the same way that when I'm selling you this glass. From crate and barrel, I am selling you the glass, and the glass is now yours. I've transferred property to you.\\n\\nSoftware is not that, so the whole world of software is built on a license agreement. The source code that computer program the actual right of that is retained by the creator, and you license the copyright to your customer to be able to use that on their machine.\\n\\nThere's this dual idea that computer software is copyrightable, and you can grant a license under certain conditions for customers to use it. That is the legal framework for which the next 50 years of technology at large would operate under.\\n\\nDavid: For the moment though...\\n\\nBen: They have a piracy problem.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The law isn't going to change until 1980. Microsoft would be dead if they didn't figure out a solution to this before 1980. This is when Bill ultimately realizes, shoot, we did the wrong business deal with MITS here. MITS has to sell, and customers have to make the decision buy our BASIC. It's a key critical part of the value of the computer. It's the whole thing.\\n\\nBen: It makes that machine useful.\\n\\nDavid: Without it, it is not useful. It's totally setting up the wrong incentives and value equation that customers should be buying this themselves. It should be included by the hardware OEM in the machine that they are selling and in the total purchase price. If that happens, We no longer have a piracy problem because we're just getting paid as part of the purchase of the machine.\\n\\nBen: Right, it should be a royalty.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The problem is that is not the deal that they had with MITS.\\n\\nBen: Right, or framed differently. Instead of saying, hey, consumer, do you want to buy something else too and make a new purchase decision, they should be saying, hey computer manufacturer, we make your thing actually useful, so pay us for it.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. During 1975 and 1976, MITS pretty much had this new microcomputer market all to themselves. There were a couple of other competitors who sprung up, but nothing made. The Altair and MITS was the microcomputer company.\\n\\nAll that changes, though, in a big way in 1977, when what Byte Magazine calls the 1977 Trinity hits the market. That is three machines, the Tandy/RadioShack TRS-80, the Commodore Personal Electronic Transactor, or the acronym PET, and the Apple II. All three of which machines were like the Altair, low cost, mass market.\\n\\nUnlike the Altair, they were not kits. They were fully assembled, fully functional, right out of the box, and they each had their own major distribution advantages. In Bill's words, these three machines, the 1977 Trinity, ignite volume in the market. Bill loves these really dramatic verbs like we attacked the manual, they ignite the volume in the market.\\n\\nBen: The press just latches on to him. Whenever Bill has a leaked memo or something where he talks about all this war terminology, those all become headlines.\\n\\nDavid: It's so great. Earlier, during 1976, Microsoft had started getting approached by a few of the bigger computing companies NCR (National Cash Register), GE, Control Data Systems. I want to license Microsoft BASIC for the 8080 microprocessor here so that we can experiment with these things. Each of these deals would have been revenue to Microsoft of $100,000-ish.\\n\\nEd and MITS, they keep dragging their feet on negotiating these. They've got the exclusive license. Everything's got to go through MITS. Most of them are turning down because Ben, you said, they don't want anybody to come in and compete with them.\\n\\nBen: Yup, there's the misaligned incentive.\\n\\nDavid: There's the misaligned incentive. There is the clause that Bill and Microsoft, and I presume Bill Sr. put in the original agreement—is MITS is using its best efforts to commercialize the BASIC and gain adoption in the market? You can make a pretty strong argument that they're not.\\n\\nEd, though, unbeknownst to Bill and Paul, has another reason that he's dragging his feet on these deals, which is that he's about to sell the company. In May of 1977, MITS gets acquired by the tape drive manufacturer, Pertec, for $6.5 million. Ed rides off into the sunset.\\n\\nPertec knows about this dispute with Microsoft, and they come in and they figure, who is this Bill Gates? He's a 21-year-old kid, a college dropout, we're a big company, we can deal with this. Robert says an amazing quote later. He says, \\\"Pertec kept telling me they could deal with this kid. It was a little Roosevelt telling Churchill that he could deal with Stalin.\\\"\\n\\nBen: Oh, my God.\\n\\nDavid: I also don't think they realized that this kid's dad is one of the best corporate attorneys in the country.\\n\\nBen: Bill Gates was just constantly underestimated, which worked to his advantage in those early days.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: This is the thing about Microsoft. People forget how insanely young Bill was. He was just 20. To put that in context, he's only 7 years older than Jensen Huang, but they feel an entire generation apart since Microsoft was started almost 20 years before NVIDIA. When you start bending your mind around like, oh, Bill Gates is still pretty young, considering what an institution Microsoft has become in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Microsoft next year is going to have its 50th anniversary. I believe that'll also be the same year that Bill turns 70. That's wild.\\n\\nBen: Yeah.\\n\\nDavid: That fall in 1977. The dispute between MITS/Pertec and Microsoft goes to arbitration in Albuquerque. The interim months while this arbitration is happening are the only moment in Microsoft's history where cash gets tight. They're running out of money because they can't really make any sales here.\\n\\nBen: They don't control their destiny.\\n\\nDavid: People aren't paying MITS for the BASIC. They're \\\"pirating\\\" the software. They can't do deals with all the other computer companies that want to come licensed directly, so things get a little tight. Microsoft ends up winning the arbitration, I believe, in maybe November 1977, meaning they are now totally free to license BASIC to anybody who wants to buy it on any terms that they want.\\n\\nThey turn around. They immediately license it to Trinity, Apple, Commodore, Radio Shack, and Tandy. They license it to all the big companies, the GEs, the NCRs, who want to experiment with microcomputers.\\n\\nThere's a really funny story with Apple that apparently, Woz had more or less written 95% of their own BASIC. But it didn't have floating point numbers, it only had integer numbers. Jobs is totally writing Woz. He's like, the BASIC is really important. Can you just finish it? Can you do floating point? Woz just doesn't do it, so Jobs has to go license Microsoft's BASIC. Amazing.\\n\\nBen: That's the first deal that happens between the companies. There's so many deals done, both directions, commercial deals, equity deals, legal disputes in both directions. This is the very first time that they do something together.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Bill, Paul, and Microsoft, do all these deals. They do them all as cash upfront, fixed cost, all you companies, you're going to pay us. You include the BASIC in the machines that you're selling, and we're going to get all the money up front. Super presciently, though, Bill does not value maximize on these deals.\\n\\nThe Apple deal is $31,000 for eight years of access for Apple for the Apple II Microsoft's BASIC. They're not price gouging here because Bill sees, he's like, the play here is we want to make it a no brainer for everybody who's selling a microcomputer to have Microsoft's BASIC on it, because we want to set the standard.\\n\\nIf we are the standard programming environment that anybody who's using these computers—and again, anybody who is using these computers is programming them, they're used to the Microsoft version of BASIC—we're going to have so much power that it'll become a self-fulfilling prophecy. All of our competitors will just wither away. Nobody will want them because it's not going to be compatible with the language everybody knows. Once people start trading and then ultimately developing and selling software that they've written, it's only going to run on our BASIC interpreter, not anybody else's.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating. I actually didn't know that it started this early. One correction there, you don't know for a fact it's only going to run on Microsoft's BASIC interpreter, but you do know for a fact that it will run on Microsoft's BASIC interpreter. If it's cheap enough, why would you take the chance on a clone that might have one or two things wrong with it?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Basically, his vision is, I want to remove any oxygen from any argument anyone could have about not using Microsoft's BASIC on a microcomputer. He thinks about this concept as a positive spiral that he really in his mind is the reason for Microsoft's success.\\n\\nHe says, “Success reinforces success. In a growing market, one way of doing something gets a slight advantage over its competitors, this is most likely to happen with high technology products that can be made in great volume for a very little increase in cost.” If you get that slight advantage, it'll compound, and this is what he's playing for here.\\n\\nBen: It's interesting. In the earliest days, what was stopping someone else from writing a BASIC interpreter and licensing it to Apple or RadioShack? Nothing. There were other smart people out there. It was just a very good business decision to say, we got to close that door. We just got to make this a no-brainer for people to buy from us, because if we're value maximizing and it's starting to feel expensive, they're going to turn elsewhere until we get a lead.\\n\\nDavid: The Apple story is the perfect example. The Woz thing is cute, it makes for a good story, and oh, he didn't finish the BASIC. But when Microsoft sold them the BASIC, which was already getting established as the standard for $31,000...\\n\\nBen: Sure. Why not?\\n\\nDavid: No brainer. Apple could have gone out and hired another programmer to finish the BASIC. They're like, wait, we could do that, or I could just get the standard one for $31,000. I'm going to do that.\\n\\nBen: Just because it's important to establish there are trade offs for everything, if you're running a startup right now, you might think to yourself, oh, great. I'll just run that exact strategy. The important thing here is (a) Most of the work was already done for the original BASIC. (b) Bill was doing it himself, Bill and Paul, so the importance of technical co-founders. Their overhead was crazy low.\\n\\nThey could do these deals where they don't make very much money. I think at the end of 1977, there were five employees. Their overhead was just so unbelievably low that they could take a really long lens.\\n\\nDavid: Even though it takes until the very end of 1977 when the MITS dispute gets resolved and Microsoft can actually make money again, they end 1977 with $381,000 in revenue, despite zero for the first 11 months of the year. They're just rolling in cash. This is when Bill famously goes out and buys a green Porsche 911 and is motoring around Albuquerque, getting all sorts of speeding tickets and hilarious stuff.\\n\\nBen: This is when he got his mugshot, right?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I think that's right.\\n\\nBen: This is the classic Bill Gates holding up the...\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Amazing.\\n\\nBen: He got, I think, three speeding tickets in one day, two of which were from the same police officer.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and there are funny stories of the Albuquerque police thought, how is a kid driving a Porsche 911? He must be a drug dealer or something.\\n\\nBen: Even when he was 20–21, he looked 17.\\n\\nDavid: Right. It's like, do you even have a driver's license?\\n\\nBen: Wild.\\n\\nDavid: Back to what you're saying, it's a really, really important point. To make this dynamic work, you need to be able to afford the investment in the fixed cost for the software, for the technology to make it that little bit superior, like Bill's talking about, the slight advantage over the competitors. At this moment in time, the industry is completely brand new. The software industry is brand new.\\n\\nThe amount that that fixed costs takes, the cost is quite low. Really, it's just Bill and Paul's time and dedication to this industry that nobody else is making that investment. You can't run this playbook today because in any market, even a brand new market, even a speculative market, the minimum viable fixed cost is billions of dollars.\\n\\nBen: Right. Yeah, that's interesting. I also think this moment galvanized something important, which is Bill and Paul could look around and see that there is going to be so much value created by microcomputers and by software. They really found religion around software is magic. The things that people can create now that we've done this BASIC interpreter and these machines are cheap and plentiful. The magic will take care of itself as long as we ensure this industry can just exist and do its thing.\\n\\nThey flipped from this mode of we need to bite and scratch and claw, and make sure that we win in deals to, huh, how can we enable software as a thing to thrive? I'm sure we can position ourselves well to capture some or a lot of that. I think they became almost stewards of the software industry and evangelists from this point forward.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. They also do another really prescient thing the next year in 1978, which is they go global.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Nobody else is going global yet, and the way that this happens is so fun. Bill gets a call one day.\\n\\nBen: Also, how crazy is it? You've got five people, you're operating out of Albuquerque, you just finally expanded from having one customer, and you're like, you know what we should do this year? Let's open in Japan and become an international company.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. The way this happens is one day, Bill gets a call from a guy named Kazuhiko Nishi, or Kay Nishi, who's a computer enthusiast in Japan, has gotten a hold of Microsoft BASIC, and totally shares the same vision as Bill and Paul. He doesn't have a Paul nor is he technical himself.\\n\\nHe's like, I'm going to bring you guys to Japan. I'm going to bring you to all the big computer companies. They agree that Kay will become Microsoft's exclusive distribution partner in Japan. By the next year in 1979, half of Microsoft's revenue is coming from Japan, which is wild.\\n\\nBen: It's unbelievable, and it stayed at that very high run rate of an international being a huge chunk, close to half always basically forever. This is a huge cornerstone of Microsoft's success that they were an international company from year three of their existence.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Revenue in 1977, that last month of revenue was almost $400,000. 1978 revenue is $1.3 million.\\n\\nBen: They have 13 employees at this point.\\n\\nDavid: In 1979, revenue is $2.4 million. At the end of that year, they're like, all right, we got to get out of Albuquerque.\\n\\nBen: They've got 25 employees, I believe, at that point.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, something like that. This is when they moved to Seattle. It's interesting to hear Bill talk about this. He actually really liked Albuquerque. Specifically, there weren't any distractions there.\\n\\nBen: No distractions, weather was great.\\n\\nDavid: Everybody was happy there, but the big problem was recruiting. He's like, if we're going to build this into the opportunity that I see, the vision that I see and that Paul shares with me, there's no way we're going to do that in Albuquerque. We got to move to a hub.\\n\\nBen: He's got three reasons for why Seattle in particular. By the way, it worked. Every single person except for his secretary did make the move. (1) He grew up in Seattle. He's like, I just want to go home. He justifies it in two other ways, which I found pretty fascinating. This is from an interview in the early 90s that he did.\\n\\nHe said it basically came down to Seattle or Silicon Valley. In Silicon Valley, it's hard to keep secrets because there's a rumor mill. In Seattle, we can be a little bit more removed, and we can announce things when we want to announce them.\\n\\n(2) In Silicon Valley, people switch around companies. I don't want that. I want people to just work at Microsoft. There was a disadvantage to not being able to recruit from your competitors, but for a while, they were really the only game in town in Seattle.\\n\\nDavid: But not really, though, because pretty quickly, Microsoft is such an important part of the industry. They recruit from Silicon Valley, too. We're going to talk about some of the people who come up. You're totally right, people stay at Microsoft. They don't leave. This continues right through to this day.\\n\\nThe other thing that I think is really important to say that makes it work for Seattle in a way that I don't know that this could have worked in too many other places in the country is the University of Washington. The computer science department there was really good. There were great people. Steve Russell had come out there. There was real talent, and they were churning out graduates out of the U-Dub that would go on to populate Microsoft for decades to come.\\n\\nBen: Bill, of course, reinvested in that flywheel, donating tons of money to the university. There are buildings, there are whole new schools.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, absolutely. They played right into it.\\n\\nBen: Today, it's always a top 10, if not top 5 computer science program in the country. But unlike other top computer science programs, it's a state school, so it just has huge volumes. I think more students come out of the University of Washington and go to big tech than any other program in the country. That has stayed this amazing advantage.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I think the only thing even close to it is Berkeley in the Bay Area with a lot of the same dynamics. But there's Stanford there too, so it's a dual university system in the Bay Area. You cannot overstate how important the University of Washington was to this decision and an ultimate success of coming to Seattle.\\n\\nThis brings us to 1980 in the beginning of the year when they move to Seattle, just in time for, I think you can make a very strong argument, the single most important deal ever done in the history of technology. It's crazy to even say it now, the Microsoft-IBM PC partnership.\\n\\nBen: It's crazy. You have this absolute behemoth partnering with someone that's not really relevant. If you're standing here today, it sounds like I'm talking about Microsoft partnering with IBM. At the time, it was IBM partnering with Microsoft. It was the only computer company that mattered in the entire world, got themselves into a particular situation where they came to Microsoft looking for help. It's the craziest set of events that made this possible, and I can't wait to dive into it.\\n\\nDavid: Me too. Before we do, this is the perfect time to talk about another one of our favorite enterprise software platforms, ServiceNow, who is one of our big partners here in Season 14.\\n\\nBen: ServiceNow is the AI platform for your enterprise, helping automate processes, improve service delivery, and increase efficiency. Over 85% of the Fortune 500 runs on them, and they have quickly joined the Microsofts and the NVIDIAs as one of the most important enterprise technology vendors in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Just like those companies, ServiceNow has AI baked in everywhere in their platform, and they're also a major partner of both Microsoft and NVIDIA. I was at NVIDIA's GTC last week, which, by the way, was insane. I felt like a VIP at a Taylor Swift concert, it was crazy. Jensen brought up ServiceNow and their partnership many times throughout the keynote.\\n\\nWhy is ServiceNow so important both to NVIDIA and to Microsoft? AI in the real world is only as good as the bedrock platform infrastructure it runs on. For enterprises around the world, ServiceNow manages that infrastructure.\\n\\nAll the AI applications for enterprises, whether that's supercharging developers with generative AI, empowering and streamlining customer service, allowing HR to deliver better employee experiences, ServiceNow has already done the hard technical work to make rolling them out not just possible, but easy and fast.\\n\\nBen: Employees can get answers quickly with smarter self-service like changing 401(k) contributions directly through AI powered chat, or developers can build apps faster with AI powered code generation, and service agents can use AI to notify you that someone's product needs replacing before they even chat with you about it. With the ServiceNow platform, your business is 100% ready for AI. Simply turn it on, and it all works.\\n\\nDavid: They've built AI directly into their platform, so all the integration work to prepare for it that otherwise would have taken you years is already done. If you want to learn more about the ServiceNow platform and how it can turbocharge the time to deploy AI for your business, go on over to servicenow.com/acquired. When you get in touch, just tell them that Ben and David sent you.\\n\\nThe IBM PC. Why is IBM getting into the personal computer here in 1980? A fun quote we heard in our research was that IBM was the sun, the moon, the stars of the computing industry. That meant the hardcore enterprise mainframe computing industry.\\n\\nBen: David, are you going to attribute that quote or are you going to leave listeners just hanging?\\n\\nDavid: All right, I think it's time. We talked to probably 10 early Microsoft people in research and preparation. One of those folks was Steve Ballmer himself. He used those words in describing IBM.\\n\\nBen: And it's hard to imagine a better person to get their perspective on what IBM meant to the world at this point in time, because 1980 was also the year that Steve joined Microsoft. Literally at the same time in 1980, you've got the management team coming together with Steve, Bill, and Paul Allen, and you've got the IBM thing going on, and you've got them moving to Seattle. We haven't even talked about Charles Simonyi yet, but this was the year he joined.\\n\\nDavid: This is the year. Every year for Microsoft until this point is the year, but 1980 is big.\\n\\nBen: Okay, so why is IBM the sun, the moon, and the stars of computing? Why are they getting into this PC? It's way cheaper than anything else they sell. It seems to be a totally different business strategy, a different customer set. What's going on?\\n\\nDavid: All the early microcomputers we were just talking about, the Altair, the Apple II, the TRS-80, are all 8-bit machines. They're running the Intel 8080 processor or a competitor making a similar 8-bit processor. The problem with an 8-bit processor is that the maximum data size for a given instruction cycle in the processor—this is called a data word in computer science terminology—is 256, 28. You can't represent any number greater than 256 in any given CPU clock cycle in an 8-bit machine.\\n\\nBen: It's effectively a bandwidth limitation, where if you're in a single clock cycle trying to do some particular instruction, it's a very, very small amount of data that you can move through the arithmetic logic unit or that you can move through the processor in that clock cycle.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. You could think of it as an hourglass or something. There's all the data sitting there in memory at the top of the hourglass, and then there's this small little funnel that it goes through. That's the processor, and then it comes out.\\n\\nBen: That's a good analogy. It's going to take forever.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, into the application of the software that the user sees. You just are not really going to process it that fast.\\n\\nBen: Very primitive machines.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. For a company IBM, they eclipsed the 8-bit computing cycle a long, long, long time ago. Mainframes, even minicomputers with DEC, all these machines are at least 16-bit, if not 32-bit computing machines. 8-bit is just not interesting.\\n\\nBen: Which is why they only cost $375 or whatever for an Altair.\\n\\nDavid: Right. In late 1979, Intel announces that they're coming out with the 8086 processor, which is a 16-bit microprocessor. With 16 bits, you can really start to do some damage here in terms of the applications that you could put on this thing to eat into business software use cases.\\n\\nBen: In 16 bits, you can represent numbers up to 65,536, so that's two to the 16th. You can do interesting things passing 16 bits around at once.\\n\\nDavid: There are some really, really fun aspects to this. If you look at pictures of these processors, what did the 8080, the 8-bit processor look like? And then you look at what the 8086, the 16-bit processor, looked like? You can see this.\\n\\nIn the 8008 processor that's only eight bits, you see only nine pins coming off of the little chip. There's the eight pins for the data bits, and then I think there's one more control pin. If you look at the 8086 processor, it's a much longer rectangle with 16, 17, maybe 20 pins coming off of it. You see this physically represented in the chip.\\n\\nBen: The further we get in the computing world, the more abstract stuff becomes. It's always fun to go back in history when these concepts were so grounded in our physical reality that's easily observable since everything was so much bigger too.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Back in 1980, the 8086 has been announced, 16-bit microprocessor is coming. IBM has already lived through missing a computing expansion era once with DEC and the minicomputer. They just let DEC take that market. Of course, that didn't really hurt IBM, but man, it would have been nice to also have that market too.\\n\\nBen: The thing that they're observing about the microcomputer market is it's exploding. People in our industry know about DEC, people in the broader world never knew about DEC. But I think it's a very different rate of adoption and rate of demand with microcomputers where IBM started to look at and go, oh, this might be a really big computer market for people.\\n\\nDavid: They're finally observing the same thing that Bill and Paul did all the way back in the Traf-O-Date days of this is an exponential cycle. Moore's law, this is exponential, and exponential gets real big very quickly once you get a few years in.\\n\\nBen: Yup.\\n\\nDavid: The mini computer cycle never was that. It's hard to remember today, but just to underscore this again, in 1980, IBM was the most valuable company in the entire world, the highest market cap company, bigger than all the oil companies in 1980.\\n\\nBen: The sun, the moon, and the stars.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Do you know what their market capital was?\\n\\nBen: In 1980, $150 billion?\\n\\nDavid: You are almost an order of magnitude off $34 billion. That was the most valuable company. It is wild what a different world we live in today.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, even inflation adjusted, it's interesting that the rate of growth of the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap has far outpaced inflation.\\n\\nDavid: That company, the most valuable in the world, they're going to tiny little Microsoft that's just moved to Seattle for this partnership. What's going on here? This is just so amazing. They deserve so much credit here. They got the Clay Christensen disrupt yourself, disruptive technology thing intuitively decades before Clay writes any of this stuff.\\n\\nThe way that they decide to compete is all the things that Clay wrote about are working against us here. What we need to do is we need to create essentially a skunk works division, just our Lockheed episode. We need to do something outside the company, completely removed from the politics, sure, but the business incentives not to disrupt ourselves, and create a new division they called the entry level systems division. Actually, it may have existed before, but they repurpose it.\\n\\nBen: This is in Boca Raton?\\n\\nDavid: In Boca Raton, Florida. Very nice place. We were just there a couple of months ago, but not a technology hotbed in the world. They create a secret project called Project Chess, secret from the rest of the company, the whole world. The goal is to develop the IBM microcomputer or the personal computer, as people are starting to refer to microcomputers.\\n\\nThis is wild. They're going to do it in secret with a small team with no other IBM resources. That means this small team, the only way they can do it is to use all off-the-shelf components from technology providers, basically play on the same level playing field as all the other microcomputer manufacturers out there.\\n\\nOne more thing, IBM leadership tells this team in Boca, they have to ship the PC to customers within one year.\\n\\nBen: It's a crazy constraint.\\n\\nDavid: It is a total crazy constraint. A couple of quotes on this. Don Estridge, who is one of the leaders of Project Chess, would later say that the company realized that if you're going to compete against people who started in a garage, obviously a reference to Apple here, you have to start in a garage yourself. Lou Gerstner, who later would take over IBM, would describe this whole Boca project as, \\\"The way you get an elephant to tap dance.\\\"\\n\\nBen: The question is, are they playing from behind and thus have to adopt a flawed strategy, or is this strategy of assembling with all off-the-shelf components actually a good strategy if it works?\\n\\nDavid: Let's tell the story and then come back to it.\\n\\nBen: Great.\\n\\nDavid: Okay. What do they do? The hardware aspect of this is trivial, basically. Ed Roberts could put together the hardware to sell a microcomputer and do this deal with Intel. I think IBM can do a deal with Intel, not necessarily trickier but the more important part is the software. Thanks to Bill's genius strategy about be the volume player, don't optimize on per unit price, set the standards out there.\\n\\nBen: They were the world's leading provider of programming language interpreters, right?\\n\\nDavid: 100%. There is one game in town and one game in town only, and that is Microsoft in Bellevue, Washington at this point in time.\\n\\nBen: Now, interpreters are notably different from operating systems, but Microsoft definitely has raised the flag. Everyone could see, if I want to go buy software for my computers, broadly, they're an interesting group to talk to.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Obviously, operating systems are going to become really, really big here in just a sec. Again, the 8-bit generation operating systems weren't that important because people were writing their own software. The standardized software, packaged application software doesn't happen until the 16-bit era and doesn't really, really happen until the 16-bit era and the IBM PC. That's why BASIC the interpreter is so important.\\n\\nWhat happens? IBM calls up Bill Gates. By August, 1980, the two companies are in serious talks to partner and work together on the IBM PC. We referenced Steve Ballmer a minute ago. The timing is just crazy. Steve had just joined the company in June of 1980.\\n\\nBen: He's employee number 30.\\n\\nDavid: The Microsoft team of 30, which the whole company of Microsoft pivots to work on the IBM PC partnership, is bigger than the Project Chess team in Boca.\\n\\nBen: It's amazing.\\n\\nDavid: Wow. Okay, Bill has just convinced Steve to drop out of business school at Stanford and come help him and Paul run the company. Microsoft at this point in time is still a partnership. Steve is the first person besides Bill and Paul to get equity in the company when he joins. It's 8.5% and it's a handshake deal at this point.\\n\\nBen: Bill really, really wanted to bring Steve on. He knew him from the Harvard days, knew what an asset he could be.\\n\\nDavid: He is the Yin of Bill's Yang.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Frankly, 8.5%, it's a big grant. Who's out there running a 30-person company, and you're giving away 8.5% slugs? That just doesn't happen. Those are founder shares. This is really a reflection that the way that Bill thought about Steve was as a founder.\\n\\nIn fact, it created some tension with Paul Allen, where Bill asked Paul, if they could go to 5%, Paul said, sure. And then Bill actually offered him 8.5%. Paul got upset and Bill said, I'll eat the 3.5%. It can come out of my share because I want him that bad.\\n\\nDavid: He's the perfect person for this point in time. Bill was the only salesperson doing these OEM deals. Now they're dealing with IBM. They're entering the enterprise world. This needs to be a real business.\\n\\nBack to the IBM negotiations, obviously Microsoft is very interested. IBM is not just very interested in working with Microsoft. They have to work with Microsoft. They're the only game in town.\\n\\nBen: Specifically, they asked Microsoft for programming languages. They're like, we're making this great PC, we're going to need a BASIC. We think you guys are working on a COBOL. We'd like some COBOL.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, Fortran. Give us the whole thing. There's some debate on whether it was the Microsoft side or the IBM side that really saw the vision of, hey, the 16-bit generation is going to enable real business software use cases on the personal computer, but it doesn't matter. That's the plan here, and that is absolutely what happens.\\n\\nThese initial discussions are for the programming language. Microsoft doesn't make an operating system at this point, because in the 8-bit generation, the operating system, I think, was a glorified bootloader to just get into the programming environment so that you could either write or load up the BASIC programs that Microsoft was going to interpret and then run.\\n\\nIn the 8-bit generation, most, if not all hardware providers of microcomputers just wrote their own operating systems. It just wasn't a big deal. Now, there was one off-the-shelf operating system out there from a company called Digital Research, which was run by Gary Kildall, who, I think as we talked about earlier, Bill and Paul had actually intersected with back in Seattle.\\n\\nBen: Yup. I think they were reasonably friendly.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I think they were quite friendly because they partnered. You needed the operating system to get into the programming environment. It wasn't that big of a deal. Whenever anybody needed one off-the-shelf, Bill and Microsoft would just refer people over to Digital to get it.\\n\\nBen: Yup. CP/M, right?\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. CP/M, which I think is maybe Control Program for Microprocessors, I think, is the abbreviation there.\\n\\nBen: God, they were so bad. Every single thing that's been named to this point, except for the company Microsoft, was a horrible name. The processor is 8008, and now it's 8080, but the machine is 8800, that the processor is inside. Give me a break, everyone. It's horrible naming.\\n\\nDavid: Bill and I'm sure Paul too, but Bill is the only person in this industry that has the vision for what this can become, even Intel. Bill talks about this. He doesn't think that Intel even realizes what's happening here. They're just like, oh, we're just making more chips, and people use them for stuff.\\n\\nBen: It does seem like very few people are thinking about their products as something they really need to build a brand around with consumers, hence the naming schemes.\\n\\nDavid: The IBM, Microsoft discussions are going along. IBM's like, oh, hey, yeah, we need an operating system. Bill, I think from everything we've read and folks we've talked to, in good faith just does the standard thing he's always done in these situations. He's like, oh yeah, go talk to Gary, go talk to Digital Research. He can probably do that.\\n\\nBen: Right. We don't have an operating system, this guy does.\\n\\nDavid: What happens next is unclear. But what is clear is however it goes down, this is one of, if not the biggest business blunder in history. IBM, that team from Project Chess, flies down, I think, directly from Seattle and talking with Bill and Steve to Monterey, California, where Digital Research is based at this point, to meet with Gary and his wife, Dorothy, who run the business together. Bill's called them. He's like, hey, I got a big OEM client coming down, needs an operating system.\\n\\nBen: He signed hefty, hefty NDAs. He cannot say who it is, but he's like, you really should take this seriously.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The team comes down. Obviously, they show up there from IBM. There's a big snafu where Gary does not attend the meeting. There are conflicting reports about what happened.\\n\\nBen: Was it one of them that he's out flying an airplane?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I'm pretty sure he was flying his personal airplane while this happens. Some reports are he was just out joyriding and missed it. Some reports are no, he was on a business trip, knew it was happening, but he had another important business meeting. He didn't know that this was IBM that was coming. Regardless, it doesn't really matter because IBM just wants the operating system.\\n\\nDorothy does meet with them. She's unwilling to sign their NDA. There's a lawyer from Digital Research who gets involved, and he doesn't really understand what's going on.\\n\\nThe punchline is that IBM leaves this interaction with the belief that Gary and Digital Research aren't up for working with them and aren't capable of producing here. Producing is important because it's not like the existing CP/M OS that they made would work here. They would have to write a new version, a 16-bit version, and they hadn't done that yet.\\n\\nBen: In particular, they would have to do some customizing. But part of what IBM wants is a customized version of an operating system for the IBM PC. They don't want this to be fully off-the-shelf.\\n\\nJust to add one more stir the pot of history here, there is another version of this story where Gary does actually have a conversation with IBM, and it blows up over licensing terms. What Gary really wants is a significant royalty of every IBM PC sold, and IBM walks over that. Whether that happened or whether it's just an NDA issue, either way, I think we all know the IBM PC did not end up running the CP/M operating system.\\n\\nDavid: That's amazing. I didn't know that. We'll talk about that when we get to the business terms of the Microsoft IBM deal in a minute. But for the moment, there's no deal yet because an operating system needs to be provided here.\\n\\nIBM goes back to Microsoft and they're like, hey, this guy you referred us to ain't going to work. The way that I read some quotes from the IBM people here were like, we just threw the problem back in Microsoft's lap of you guys deal with this, you source an operating system.\\n\\nI'd like to say that Bill, Steve, and Microsoft, you don't need to give them an opportunity twice. In this case, you did need to give them an opportunity twice because they almost flubbed it and sent IBM down to see Gary. This time they don't flub it. They're like, okay, we'll get you an operating system.\\n\\nBen: Enter Seattle Computer Products.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. It just so happens that right down the road from Microsoft in the Seattle area—I think despite being named Seattle Computer Products, I think this company was actually based in Tukwila, Washington—a programmer named Tim Patterson had just written a 16-bit operating system for the 8086 that Intel had just announced, and he was calling it the Quick and Dirty 16-bit Operating System or QDOS for short, and had it ready to go.\\n\\nWhy had he written this? What was this company, Seattle Computer Products? Why did they have an operating system? They were a component provider to microcomputer manufacturers. They essentially made motherboards. When Intel now has announced this new 16-bit processor generation that they're coming out with, Seattle Computer Products want to sell motherboards and have them ready for 16-bit.\\n\\nThey need to test and play around with these things, and their customers are asking for it. They had been going to Kildall and Digital Research too and badgering them to like, hey, write the 16-bit version of CP/M. Gary just didn't, so Tim's like, fine, I'll do a quick and dirty version myself, and thus DOS is born.\\n\\nBen: Incredible, which of course later, they would drop the Q and call it DOS, the Disk Operating System. Something about dirty didn't have a ring to it when you're selling it to IBM.\\n\\nDavid: No. Bill, Paul, and Microsoft have learned about this. They know Seattle Computer Products, they know Rod Brock, the guy who owns the company. They get in touch with him and they say, hey, can we license QDOS from you and Tim? We've got a big OEM customer that wants a 16-bit operating system. They work out a deal whereby Microsoft pays Seattle Computer Products $25,000 for the rights to adapt and sell QDOS to the one unnamed original equipment manufacturer who they're working with.\\n\\nTim, actually, is jazzed about this. He ends up leaving SCP computer products and joining Microsoft. With the rest of the team, he's part of building DOS, taking his initial work and turning it into real DOS. Later on, before this all gets announced and the PC ships, Microsoft would pay Seattle computer products another $50,000 for full rights to own 86 QDOS, sell and license it to anybody else indefinitely. I believe the total amount of dollars that changed hands here is $75,000.\\n\\nBen: Unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: This is DOS. One programmer wrote a \\\"quick and dirty\\\" operating system, and Microsoft bought the license to that and adapted it into DOS. Tim, when he was at Seattle computer products, definitely did not write DOS as DOS. It's not like Microsoft bought all of DOS for $75,000. They did a lot of work on it, but this is how it all goes down.\\n\\nBen: Microsoft would eventually generate billions of dollars on DOS-based products. You're exactly right in the same way that Instagram today is a much different code base than Instagram and much larger code base than Instagram when it was purchased, but my God, $75,000 to buy DOS to get this whole thing started. Until Windows 95, all of the Windows operating systems were DOS-based.\\n\\nDavid: It's just crazy. It really illustrates how fast things were moving, how much all this was getting invented and discovered in real time that even to this point, Bill Gates isn't thinking that operating systems are that important. This is just a shortcut to get the deal done with IBM to make it happen.\\n\\nBen: Also, David, I got to say, I just looked it up. The address of Seattle Computer Products, on the original business card for Seattle Computer Products where I presume QDOS was written, the space is available, so I know where our next studio needs to be.\\n\\nDavid: It's in Tequila?\\n\\nBen: It's in Tequila.\\n\\nDavid: All right. The rent can't be that expensive then, so let's do it.\\n\\nBen: Correct.\\n\\nDavid: Hell, yeah. We've been joking for years about making the Acquired Museum. We might have a location.\\n\\nOkay. Now they've got the operating system, they've got QDOS or DOS in place to license the IBM. The only thing that is left to formalize the partnership is the business terms.\\n\\nBen, if what you said is right about the Gary Kildall IBM negotiations, this is just a master stroke from Bill here in the licensing with IBM, because there are two really, really big levers that it looks like Bill is giving big time on one of them, but he is winning big time on the other one.\\n\\nBen: What are they?\\n\\nDavid: The one that it looks like he's giving on is he does another fixed cost OEM deal with IBM.\\n\\nBen: This is in Paul Allen's memoir. IBM paid Microsoft $75,000 for testing and consultation, $45,000 for DOS, and $310,000 for an array of 16-bit language interpreters and compilers. All told, bundled together, that is $430,000 fixed that IBM paid Microsoft with no ongoing obligation.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. No per copy royalties. Every copy of DOS that IBM sells is either included as part of systems that they're selling, or they're free to charge independently for DOS, whatever amount they want, Microsoft gets $0. If it's true that this is where things fell apart with Gary Kildall, crazy that Bill is willing to do this.\\n\\nBen: You might say, what? Didn't Bill learn his lesson? Why would he ever agree to this?\\n\\nDavid: On the one hand, this is what he was doing with Apple and others. He was doing these fixed cost deals. He would think, man, IBM, this is the time. People aren't going to pirate IBM software. Now's the time to really grab the money bags.\\n\\nBen: But Bill saw something that no one else did.\\n\\nDavid: I don't know if it was directly in exchange in the negotiations, but the other lever that he saw, that he pulled was Microsoft retained the rights to own DOS and to own their languages and license it and them to anyone else they wanted at any price on any terms.\\n\\nBen: It's so interesting, because what ended up happening that Bill Gates masterminded was once we distribute our operating system through IBM's PC, that's going to become the thing everyone buys. Now, in the 16-bit generation, when there are people building programs for computers, not just developers, once those application developers who are writing programs are targeting an operating system, then that is the operating system that every other OEM, every other computer maker is also going to want and really need, and we're going to be the ones that they have to come to to buy it.\\n\\nI can't figure out, did IBM miss this fact? Or did they know it? Basically, what IBM did was they were the one place where every business needed to go for their computer needs. What they did in this negotiation was they actually handed that over to Microsoft. They said, we are going to become a commodity, just like every other hardware manufacturer, and you are going to be the point of integration for the whole ecosystem. You're going to be the linchpin that everyone has to target for their applications.\\n\\nDavid: I think there are two things going on here, one small and one big. The small thing is actually related all the way back to the beginning of the episode, what you said, Ben, about the antitrust concerns within IBM. To hear them say it, they actually didn't want ownership of the software. They wanted it to be separate because it would look better.\\n\\nBen: Because then they have the plausible deniability of, how could we possibly have a monopoly? We're buying off-the-shelf...\\n\\nDavid: Part of an ecosystem, blah-blah-blah. Yeah.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. From a vendor who can sell to anybody else. We have no lock in.\\n\\nDavid: That may well be true. I think the bigger thing that just wasn't in their consideration or mindset was they (I think) assumed that once they entered the PC market, IBM was going to be the dominant player, so it didn't matter. Once IBM is selling PCs, who's going to buy a PC from anybody else? IBM is going to win this market.\\n\\nBen: Just like they have in every other line of business they've been in.\\n\\nDavid: What Bill saw was he really made a bet that the same dynamics that played out with the Altair were also going to play out with the IBM PC. There would be a million hardware manufacturers, flowers blooming here.\\n\\nBen: Building to the same spec.\\n\\nDavid: Building to the same spec.\\n\\nBen: Using the same processor.\\n\\nDavid: Which of course, they could because it was all off-the-shelf components. IBM either didn't see or didn't believe that that would actually happen.\\n\\nBen: IBM failed to see the value of software, and they certainly failed to understand what a software platform business model would be.\\n\\nDavid: Which makes sense. Why would they? They are the computing company.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Their experience in selling mainframes with everything bundled in was the wrong experience to go off of in understanding the way the future would unfold. Bill's very modest experience watching the Altair and all these Altair clone type machines, or even if they're not Altair clones, just more microcomputers that need more software, actually was the useful experience to pattern match off of of what does the world of microcomputers look like, and how is that fundamentally different than the world of mainframes.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. In a way that the mini computer generation, like we've been saying, it was like a half generation. It wasn't actually fundamentally that different other than DEC gained a foothold.\\n\\nBen: The deal that Bill Gates made with IBM for the IBM PC is the greatest deal in at least computer industry history, if not all business history, full stop.\\n\\nDavid: Let's say a little bit about why. It's obvious, but here now is IBM, most valuable company in the world. They're going to come out with the PC platform. They are going to build the market. Microsoft is going to own the linchpin, in Hamilton Helmer terms, where the power is in the market, and they're going to be free to license it at whatever terms they want to any other player who wants to enter.\\n\\nThey signed this agreement in November 1980. The IBM PC ships in August 1981. Just incredible, almost exactly a little more than a year from the time Project Chess starts to when they actually ship the PC.\\n\\nBen: Truly incredible, they pulled it off.\\n\\nDavid: Truly incredible. It changes the world. That's such a trite thing to say, but everything that everybody's imagining happens.\\n\\nBen: IBM was right that it was by far in a way the most successful personal computer on the market as soon as they released it.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. They sell 13,500 IBM PCs within the first couple of months after they announce it. Over the next two years, they sell half a million of them, makes them unquestionably the largest personal microcomputer manufacturer/market leader. Everybody at IBM is celebrating. The clones haven't arrived yet, and maybe they won't. It'll play out like they think. Not exactly.\\n\\nBefore we talk about the clones, this is really just a footnote because of course all the incentives are aligned for IBM to push DOS as the operating system for the PC. They've done this whole deal with Microsoft. They have a royalty-free deal with them.\\n\\nWhen they launch the PC, customers actually have a choice of which operating system they want on their IBM PC. They don't have to go with DOS. Consumers can choose between DOS, 16-bit CP/M. By this point in time, Gary and Digital Research have gotten their act together. They've written a 16-bit version of the CPM operating system. Or another 16-bit operating system called Pascal that came out of the University of California at San Diego.\\n\\nThe price sheet for the operating system option is Pascal is an extra $450 with your IBM PC. CP/M is an extra $175 with your IBM PC, and DOS, which was developed specifically for the PC is the best way to run it is only $60. IBM is making $60 of full 100% margin on top of their hardware for the PC by selling DOS because they don't have to pay Microsoft any of that, and they've set up the incentives that obviously everybody's going to choose DOS.\\n\\nBen: It's fascinating. And you know what? To give them a little bit more credit too, they did try to enforce that there's some amount of lock-in to the IBM PC. They did that in two ways. One is we're simplifying calling it DOS. It was PC-DOS, which is different than MS-DOS, which would get licensed to other computer makers. I don't know exactly what happened, but it basically seems like it just wasn't different enough to be meaningful to application developers. That's one piece of it.\\n\\nThe second is IBM did actually have proprietary BIOS. That was another part where they thought that that might provide them some protection, where they could stay a linchpin in the ecosystem. It wasn't just all off-the-shelf. They actually did have something that was theirs that was proprietary.\\n\\nDavid: It just turned out that the effort required to reverse engineer the IBM BIOS was trivial, basically.\\n\\nBen: Do you know the story of the Compaq BIOS?\\n\\nDavid: I know the Compaq story, but I don't know the story of the BIOS specifically. Enlighten us.\\n\\nBen:  It is basically why Compaq worked is what it comes down to. Compaq was formed basically to clone the IBM PC. They saw the market opportunity, and they realized they could buy from all the same equipment vendors. Let's go eat their margin is basically the plan.\\n\\nHowever, the one thing that was not off-the-shelf is the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), which is effectively the thing that decides to load the operating system when you turn the machine on. There's some proprietary magic that happens to call upon the operating system to do its thing. Compaq reverse engineered the BIOS. The way that they did it was very similar to Trip Hawkins and the story that he told us about his reverse engineering at Electronic Arts.\\n\\nDavid: Of the Psychogenesis.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Compaq had two engineers. One engineer went in and fully dissected the code for the IBM PC BIOS, basically saw all the proprietary calls that it made, and documented each of those calls without writing the implementation steps. Then he handed, hey, here's what the BIOS needs to interface with, over to the other engineer. The other engineer, on their own, just went through and thought of an implementation.\\n\\nThey have no idea if it's the same implementation, so it's not breaking any infringement. They're basically saying, I'm just seeing the requirements for this product, and I'm coming up with my own implementation of that product. They basically figured out how to exactly clone the IBM PC and buy the very same operating system.\\n\\nTo go back to quoting Ben Thompson because this is from his great piece again, \\\"The result was a company that came to dominate the market. Compaq was the fastest startup to ever hit $100 million in revenue, then the youngest firm to break into the Fortune 500, then the fastest company to hit $1 billion in revenue, and by 1994, Compaq was the largest PC maker in the world.\\\"\\n\\nDavid: The Compaq story is amazing. The three people who start Compaq in 1982 are actually Texas Instruments engineers who left, and they wanted to start a company. I believe as the legend goes, they were trying to decide what to start. They were considering a restaurant chain and a bunch of different business ideas. The IBM PC comes out at the end of 1981 and they're like, oh, we can clone this and do everything, the story you just told. It's wild. They start the company in 1982. Within the first year, they do $111 million of revenue of selling IBM PC clone hardware.\\n\\nBen: And is it just cheaper? Basically this is the IBM PC, but for less money?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, exactly. Same thing, cheaper.\\n\\nBen: So begins the race to the bottom of PC hardware. Completely undifferentiated, all the value accrues to the software layer.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Compaq went public the very next year, in 1983 well before Microsoft, which is funny. Compaq, all these other clone companies that get started. Microsoft licenses DOS to all of them importantly, critically, on a per-machine-sold basis. This is when they grab the money. The operating system is so deeply embedded and needs to get shipped with the computer itself.\\n\\nConsumers can go buy operating systems to upgrade and whatnot, but no hardware manufacturer is going to ship a 16-bit PC without an operating system. Piracy is not an issue here. Microsoft can now do a per-copy-sold, per-machine-sold license with all these clones. My God, it's just a geyser of money.\\n\\nBen: Microsoft used IBM to generate demand for their software, and then they used every other PC manufacturer to capture the value that all that demand created.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I think I have these numbers and timeframes right. I believe that for calendar year 1982, Microsoft's revenue was $25 million. I think this must have been when they switched to fiscal year end and June 30th. Microsoft's fiscal year end starting then and up through now is June 30th.\\n\\nThey're fiscal 1984. The year ended June 30th, 1984, so 1983 midpoint to 1984 midpoint. Microsoft does $98 million. In an 18-month period from the end of 1982, they go from $25–$98 million. It's all on the back of the clones. Unlike Compaq that they did $111 million of revenue their first year, they're selling hardware which has serious cogs associated with it. Microsoft, 100% essentially, gross margin, software revenue, more than doubling year on year. It's the best business of all time.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and they combined two magical principles together. This infinite replicability, zero marginal costs of software, and becoming the linchpin of the ecosystem. They are now the software that everyone needs to target, which gives them pricing power. That pricing power raises your top line, and you have no costs. It's unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: Meanwhile, in the computing industry background, while all this is going on with the launch of the IBM PC and then the clones, Apple had gone public at the end of 1980 in I think, the biggest and most successful IPO of all time at that point. Remember we talked about Genentech on the Novo Nordisk episode. They went public right before Apple, and then Apple was bigger. They're valued at $1.8 billion at IPO. Steve Jobs is this multi hundred millionaire, media darling, all this stuff.\\n\\nThe next year in 1981, Microsoft reorganizes from the partnership between Bill and Paul with the handshake deal that Steve's going to be cut in on the partnership into a stock company, a C-corporation. As part of doing that, the venture firm, Technology Venture Investors (TVI) invest $1 million, I believe, for 5% of the company. This is crazy. That's a $20 million post money valuation.\\n\\nBen: It's a 1-on-20 post when Microsoft is doing how much in revenue?\\n\\nDavid: That year, they did $17 million in revenue, and they're about to do the IBM deal. This is absolutely absurd.\\n\\nBen: It says a lot about this period of time that you could do a 1X revenue deal in a high-margin software company. I actually don't think this shows a weakness in Microsoft. Oh, they didn't have leverage or something that. That wasn't it at all, it was just the deals sucked.\\n\\nDavid: Venture capital sucked back then. There's no other way to put it.\\n\\nBen: It's only 5%, so good on Microsoft. Spoiler alert, this is the only dilution that they would ever take. That's also extremely different than today, but a $20 million valuation at this stage is frankly ludicrous.\\n\\nDavid: Even among people who should be in the know, the beauty of the software business model still is something people don't understand.\\n\\nBen: That's exactly right.\\n\\nDavid: The hotness is the hardware. It's like Apple just IPO'd. Apple's worth $1.8 billion. Like, ooh, that's the industry, ooh, it's IBM, et cetera. When Microsoft itself would go public a few years later in 1986, they actually go public the same week that they moved to the big campus in Redmond, where they are to this day. Their market cap at IPO is only $750 million despite having done $200 million of very high margin software revenue in the trailing 12 months up to that, growing 100% year over year. It's insane.\\n\\nBen: Hey, that's 4X multiple expansion off the last time they raised money.\\n\\nDavid: Right? It's just crazy that people don't yet appreciate the power.\\n\\nBen: Bill Gates and Warren Buffett did a conversation at the University of Washington in 1998. This is as late as 1998. This thing that we're talking about, the magic of the software business model and how it should be reflected in a company's valuation especially when it's a high-growth company was still not understood even by Bill Gates himself.\\n\\nHere's the quote. Bill Gates says, \\\"I think the multiples of technology stocks should be quite a bit lower than the multiples of stocks like Coke and Gillette because we are subject to complete changes in the rules. I know very well that in the next 10 years, if Microsoft is still a leader, we will have had to weather at least three crises.\\\" Bill Gates is essentially making an argument. Granted, this is in the middle of all the antitrust stuff, so he's very prime for this.\\n\\nDavid: And the Internet.\\n\\nBen: And the Internet. He's basically making the argument that disruptive forces come at you so fast in the technology industry that even though you can grow extremely fast, it's this extremely scalable thing, distributing software at zero distribution costs, and even though the margins are unbelievable because you have zero marginal costs, they still shouldn't be valued as highly as a CPG company, which is so different than the way that people think about it today.\\n\\nDavid: It's funny. I've thought about this a lot, and I actually watched that interview years ago. It's so good. There are elements of truth to this too. I think it's that for most technology companies, that is totally true. For a few technology companies that have true power and true scale, the exact opposite is true. Microsoft is still the most valuable company in the world today.\\n\\nBen: Companies that are less susceptible to disruption, more predictable in terms of high growth, high margin revenue deserve a premium. But Gates is basically arguing, everyone else doesn't.\\n\\nLet's flash all the way back to 1981 and talk about this venture capital investment, this 1-on-20 that TVI does.\\n\\nDavid: Good work if you can get a man.\\n\\nBen: How does this come to be? Even a whole year before in the fall of 1980, Dave Marquardt, one of the partners and the founders at TVI, flies up to Seattle not to meet Bill Gates, but to meet Steve Ballmer.\\n\\nDavid: Because they were classmates at GSB, right?\\n\\nBen: They weren't quite classmates, but because I think they were two years apart, so they didn't overlap, but they had some of the same social circles. Steve was effectively the screener for anyone who wanted to come and talk to Bill and try and invest in the business.\\n\\nTA Associates had been up, Sutter Hill had been up, Hambrick and Quist had been up, Xerox Ventures, and all of them only ever got to meet with Steve Ballmer and never got passed on to Bill Gates. Steve would basically just bounce them off. I know all this because there's a great oral history from the Computer History Museum, where this whole thing's in a transcript with an interview with Dave Marquardt recalling the whole thing.\\n\\nDave flies up to meet with Steve. Steve says, you're asking really interesting questions. You're thinking about our strategy the right way. You don't just want to do a transactional deal. You really think this is something special. Why don't you meet with Bill? Bill, of course, doesn't have any extra time in his schedule. He says, but I am going to the U-Dub Arizona football game at Husky stadium. Why don't you come and talk to me there?\\n\\nOf course they go, Bill doesn't pay attention to the game at all. He's just laying out the strategy, grilling Dave, and talking about software the whole time. This is fall of 1980. That's a whole year before the deal gets done. Dave's remarking at this point in 1980, they're doing $5 million in revenue, $2–$3 million in profit. They don't need VC money, and yet he was able to get in.\\n\\nHere's the quote. \\\"I was just helping them out with the business. In the venture business, you're buying and you're selling at the same time. You're trying to figure out, are these guys crazy? Are they ever going to do anything really interesting? If so, how do I get myself positioned to be able to help them do it? So I spent a lot of time up there helping recruit people. I helped to recruit Charles Simonyi, who was an early key guy.\\\" Charles Simonyi would go on, this is an aside, to write Microsoft Word. Charles was at Xerox PARC inventing the GUI.\\n\\nDavid: We're going to talk about Charles in just a sec.\\n\\nBen: Yes. He says, “And I was working with Steve on business strategy. They had these OEM customers, the PC manufacturers, and they had started to engage with IBM on this operating system. Are we just going to become a low-cost contract programming shop for IBM, an outsourced sweatshop? Or is there some way we can build a business out of this?\\n\\nWhich led to the fixed fee to IBM, the retention of the code, which then we could sell to other people. That's what created the PC industry basically.” That is his recollection of the whole thing, that he was very helpful in this transformative time for the company. At the same time, you have to look at everyone else's incentives.\\n\\nDavid: How can I be helpful, Ben?\\n\\nBen: Dave is only 29 years old, but everyone else is 23. He actually is adult supervision. At the same time, the partnership was still just a partnership, and there was a handshake deal for the equity. If you're Steve Ballmer at this point in history, it would be nice to have a forcing function to actually turn this into a corporation so that we can get some shares granted here. There's a little bit of incentive to say, hey, if we take on an outside investor, we're going to have to restructure.\\n\\nDavid: That's what I had always read about the TVI investment. Obviously, Microsoft didn't need the money. They like Dave, but also a big part of it was this was a catalyzing function to do the conversion into a C-corp.\\n\\nBen: Yes. This would create a little bit of board and governance, so it's not just Bill all the time. Bill, of course, I think is still the controlling shareholder just by the amount of stock that he owns. But there's a board. It's Bill, it's Dave, and it's Kay Nishi. It's a three-person board.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, we should say-to-vis a vis Paul, tragically, and I believe it was 1982-1983, he's diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. He ends up taking a leave and then fully leaving the company. I think he did go on and off the board at various points in time.\\n\\nBen: That's true.\\n\\nDavid: But he's no longer a full-time member of the company after his diagnosis.\\n\\nBen: Yup. On this venture investment, it's pretty fascinating. None of these are terribly compelling reasons other than, I guess, it would be nice to have a little bit of capital associated with us formalizing the corporation, but they don't need money at all. They're printing cash. They've been printing cash ever since that one tight period in Albuquerque. Dave charmed them. I think that's the answer.\\n\\nDavid: I've always heard wonderful, wonderful things about Dave, and I think everybody really did love him and see his value. But man, to be a venture capitalist in the 1980s and 1990s, oh, man, you couldn't lose.\\n\\nBen: It's pretty crazy. I think part of it too had to do with the fact that Microsoft was up in Seattle. The VCs just weren't traveling. Dave was young and he was single.\\n\\nDavid: Don Valentine famously had the rule. They didn't invest in any company that you couldn't bicycle to from Sand Hill Road.\\n\\nBen: It's crazy. Dave Marquardt, I think most weekends, is flying up to Seattle to hang out with Bill and Steve. It was a real sell. He says, I was young, I was single, I had nothing better to do, and it was really fun and intellectually interesting, so I did it. That resulted in, depending how long TVI held, one of, if not the best venture capital return in history.\\n\\nDavid: Hard to argue with that one. Okay, back to the story. There are a couple more really, really key things that happened in the PC era. Particularly now, once we're into the IBM PC era and the clones, the 16-bit era. Let's start with applications.\\n\\nLike we've been saying all along, the 8-bit era, applications, package software aren't really a thing. In 1979, at the tail end of the 8-bit era, two programs come out for the Apple II, VisiCalc and WordStar. VisiCalc is the first software spreadsheet application, and WordStar is a word processor. These applications by today's standards are super simple, stone age–type stuff, but they're the first of their kind, particularly VisiCalc and the spreadsheet. They established the potential for business applications on personal computers.\\n\\nThere's a joke at one point in the industry that the Apple II was a \\\"VisiCalc\\\" accessory for small businesses. I think that is part of what IBM is seeing and why they're deciding to now get into the industry with the personal computer. Around this time, Microsoft starts the \\\"Consumer Products Division\\\" to compete and make application software themselves.\\n\\nBen: It's quite telling it's called the Consumer Products Division to make applications. Even though they're competing to make these applications that today we would view as business tools, spreadsheets, and word processing, that is not how they referred to it.\\n\\nDavid: Right. One of the first people that they hire into this new division to get it going is an engineer, Ben, who you referenced just a minute ago, named Charles Simonyi. They poach Charles, perhaps with Dave Marquardt's help, away from the legendary Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC). I think this is one of the great misconceptions in technology history. Hopefully we can set the record straight a little bit here.\\n\\nBen: Yes. If you ask anybody in our ecosystem, save for the 1% of people who actually know this, what happened at Xerox PARC? They will tell you they invented the mouse, they invented the graphical user interface, and then Steve Jobs walked in, he saw it all, and he said, oh, my God, we have to have it. He went off and he made the Lisa, which had a graphical user interface and a mouse. That failed, but what succeeded was the Macintosh, and it's a wholesale ripoff of Xerox PARC that lives on today in Apple. That is the story that you will hear from basically everyone.\\n\\nDavid: I've heard it characterized as something like Xerox hosted a picnic in Silicon Valley, and Steve Jobs attended and dined lavishly at the feast.\\n\\nBen: All of this is true.\\n\\nDavid: Which is true. That is true. All of that is true.\\n\\nBen: But it's half the story.\\n\\nDavid: He was not the only person who dined lavishly at the feast. Microsoft did just as much directly from Xerox, and Charles was one of the main vectors by which this happened.\\n\\nHere is the list of things that were invented or basically invented at Xerox PARC. The graphical user interface, the desktop, the mouse, object-oriented programming, ethernet, laser printing, along with a whole host of other things. This is everything about modern computing, invented there.\\n\\nWho are the people who were at Xerox PARC? There was Alan Kay, there was Bob Metcalfe, who would go on to found 3Com. He invented ethernet, Metcalfe's Law.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, the value of a network scaling proportionally to the square of the number of inputs.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Bob Metcalf, Xerox PARC, Larry Tesler, who would join Apple, John Warnock, who started Adobe, Eric Schmidt worked at Xerox PARC. Everybody was there. It was a lavish picnic.\\n\\nBen: And Charles Simonyi.\\n\\nDavid: And Charles Simonyi. The thing about PARC and the computer that they built there to instantiate all these concepts, which was named the Alto, is it really was a research center. The Alto, go look it up on Wikipedia, go look at pictures. It's the Mac. The Alto is the Mac.\\n\\nBen: It's the Mac with the monitor turned on its side.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, it's a vertical Mac.\\n\\nBen: It's a 3x4 display, not a 4x3 display.\\n\\nDavid: They start making it in 1973. You might be like, wait a minute, what's going on here? The Mac doesn't come out till 1984.\\n\\nBen: 11 years earlier.\\n\\nDavid: How on earth is Xerox making the Mac in the pre 8-bit era, the pre-microprocessor era? It's not a microprocessor. The Alto is not a microprocessor architecture. It's a mini computer. What you see when you look at photos of the Alto is you see the Mac. What you don't see is under the table or behind it is a mini computer.\\n\\nBen: I never realized that.\\n\\nDavid: It is not a personal computer architecture at all. It is a 16-bit, essentially mini computer, that costs tens of thousands of dollars to make each one of them. It's a science project.\\n\\nBen: You should have a little bit more generosity for the East Coast management at Xerox for failing to commercialize this.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. The time was not right. It was not possible. It wasn't even conceived of in the microprocessor architecture, because the microprocessor basically didn't exist when they made it.\\n\\nBen: Interesting.\\n\\nDavid: In 1980, again, this year for Microsoft, same year Microsoft joins, same year they signed the IBM partnership, Charles Simonyi comes up from Xerox PARC. He's of course bringing all this same knowledge, all this same experience that Steve jobs is bringing into Apple. He's bringing all that right into Microsoft too.\\n\\nThe first thing that he gets tasked with is working with this new consumer products division to build application software to compete with VisiCalc and WordStar to compete with spreadsheets and to compete in word processing. He leads the teams that create Word and MultiPlan, Microsoft's first spreadsheet. Remember, we're still at the end of the 8-bit era. The graphical user interface doesn't exist yet other than on the Alto in Xerox PARC.\\n\\nBen: No, these are DOS applications. It's all character mode.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, it is command line interface. The vector that they think they're going to compete, at least in spreadsheets with VisiCalc, is that they're going to be on every platform out there. VisiCalc, I believe, was more or less basically only on the Apple II. That doesn't end up working too well.\\n\\nThe next generation, the IBM PC era, they make the same mistake. The application business stays focused on being on lots of machines, making software that's compatible with everything. A new company pops up called Lotus. Lotus makes the radical decision that they are going to make a spreadsheet only for the IBM PC.\\n\\nThis was genius. This is the 1-2-3 spreadsheet. It goes on to become, at that point in time, the most successful software ever. This is wild. I can't even believe I'm about to say this, and it blew my mind when I found it in research. There are a couple of years in the late eighties, where Lotus has more revenue than Microsoft and is valued higher.\\n\\nBen: Yup. In fact, the year that Microsoft went public, Lotus had more revenue than Microsoft at the IPO.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Wild.\\n\\nBen: it's crazy. Lotus 1-2-3 had some graphics, but it was still in character mode. It was a powerful spreadsheet that could start to do some graphics, even though there wasn't actually a GUI operating system yet, which is interesting. Lotus 1-2-3 was faster, it had bigger spreadsheets, and it was just more powerful. Microsoft Multiplan was still targeting the older 8-bit.\\n\\nMultiplan, despite Microsoft's best efforts, is completely left in the dust. Microsoft's trying to figure out, what should we learn from this? In talking with Pete Higgins and Mike Slade, who were both early leaders in the development and the marketing of the applications division, actually, Mike Slade went on to work directly for Steve Jobs at NeXT and Apple for many years.\\n\\nIn chatting with both of them, what basically became apparent Microsoft learned, with our applications, we should not be targeting the current platforms at all. The lesson to learn is never leave yourself open to the next generation of technology. They're learning the Moore's Law lesson again.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and how it applies to applications. Yes. You always got to target the next platform.\\n\\nBen: Right, even if that platform is not the one you own. That's the interesting thing about when they're evaluating Multiplan and they say, how do we not get Lotus 1-2-3 again, basically, the applications team gets the freedom to look around and say, okay, no matter what our overall company strategy is right now, or no matter what the systems division is doing, what is the most cutting-edge platform that is going to be so interesting to people that we can develop the most envelope-pushing technology for it? That becomes the mandate for applications.\\n\\nDavid: This is the dawn of horizontal software. You can have a whole company or a whole division of a company, in Microsoft's case, that makes this tool. That tool will be so much better than anything that even the largest companies can have their own software developers write. General Electric isn't going to write a better spreadsheet than 1-2-3. I think that the technology complement to this law is the killer app.\\n\\nBen: You have to counter position. If 1-2-3 is the best spreadsheet out there for the current technology generation, you just can't compete with them. You need to wait for the next big leap forward in order to find a new competitive vector.\\n\\nDavid: You need to be the killer app on the next platform, and that's what Lotus 1-2-3 did with the spreadsheet on the IBM PC and IBM compatible PC. That's what Microsoft decides, hey, we got to do this in the graphical interface.\\n\\nBen: Who's about to come out with the very best instantiation of a graphical user interface? Apple computer.\\n\\nDavid: That would be Steve Jobs.\\n\\nBen: Yes. The next chapter of our Microsoft story is the Macintosh in 1984.\\n\\nDavid: It's so fun.\\n\\nBen: Before we do that, this is the perfect time to talk about another one of our favorite companies and longtime Acquired partners who are back, pilot.com. For startups and growth companies of all kinds, Pilot handles all of your company's accounting, tax, and bookkeeping needs, and is in fact now by far the largest startup focused accounting firm in the entire US.\\n\\nDavid: Also, we have to give our good buddy and Pilot CEO, Waseem Daher, a special shout out here because I think he is now the only Acquired sponsor CEO, who is also a source for an episode, because back when Waseem was a student at MIT, he interviewed Bill Gates for the school paper. He dug up the PDF and sent it to us. We're going to link to it in the episode sources.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Very fun. Back to Pilot, and speaking of incredibly successful Seattle business people, we talk all the time on Acquired about Jeff Bezos' AWS-inspired axiom that startups should focus on what makes their beer taste better, i.e. only spend your limited time and resources on what is actually going to move the needle for you, your product, your customers, and outsource everything else that you need to do as a company but doesn't fit that bill.\\n\\nAccounting is example number one of what he's talking about. Every company needs this, but it needs to be done by a professional. You don't want to take any risk of something going wrong. But at the same time, it actually has zero impact on your product or your customers.\\n\\nDavid: So enter Pilot. Pilot both sets up and operates your company's entire financial stack, finance, accounting, tax, even CFO services like investor reporting from your general ledger, all the way up to budgeting and financial sections of your board decks. They've been doing this now for years across thousands of startups in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. There's nobody better who you can trust to both get finance right and make it easy and painless for your company.\\n\\nBen: These are now companies like OpenAI, Airtable, Scale, as well as large ecommerce companies. It's not just that they have the experience across startups, they can also keep working with you as you scale to the growth phase and beyond. If your company wants to go back to focusing on what makes your beer taste better, go on over to pilot.com/acquired and tell them that Ben and David sent you.\\n\\nAll right, David, why are we talking about the Mac?\\n\\nDavid: Because I think it's fair to say that the Mac made Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Office made the Mac. I don't think that it's actually a controversial statement, although it probably sounds crazy to many of you listening.\\n\\nBen: Totally. Far and away the first thing to point out is the first version of Microsoft Excel was for the Mac. It's especially crazy for all the finance people today who are like, oh, Mac Excel isn't real Excel. Excel has to happen on Windows.\\n\\nDavid: No, Excel was on the Mac. That was it.\\n\\nBen: Yes. The logic basically was Microsoft was really coming around to the idea that the next big thing in computing was the graphical user interface. The reason they were coming around to this was because they knew from Xerox PARC just as well as Apple did, and they were rapidly trying to figure out how to get All of that Xerox PARC-iness into their product line, too. That's the other half of this untold Xerox PARC story.\\n\\nOne of the first ways that they see to bring the graphical user interface to their products is launching Excel for the Mac because they basically see, the way that we got destroyed with Lotus 1-2-3, we can't compete with lotus on the IBM PC, so we're going to shelf Multiplan start over, and Excel is going to come out in the graphical user interface. We're going to try to be first and best on the GUI.\\n\\nDavid: One thing just to underscore here, Excel is the world's first graphical spreadsheet program. That's why it wins, and that's why it's so important. Imagine trying to use Excel in the command line interface. That's what VisiCalc was, that's what even 1-2-3 was. Yeah, useful, better than nothing, but graphical charts, cells, visual relationships, this is so important. Excel is where it all starts.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Of course, Apple loves this. The Macintosh came out in 1984, and everybody remembers the great intro video and the hello script. I've watched that Steve Jobs keynote because of course, I have, and it's this magical moment in computing history where finally something that's insanely great comes out. It's the beginning of Steve Jobs' unbelievable presentation prowess. It's so fun to watch it. It's, of course, a product that eventually people really loved. But at first...\\n\\nDavid: It doesn't have the killer app.\\n\\nBen: No, it's a product that was supposed to ship in 1982. It didn't, it shipped in 1984. At the time, what they were targeting for 1982 was a pretty great set of technologies. By 1984, it's an aging set of technologies. It debuts with 128K of memory, which basically isn't enough to create any interesting applications. Developers are ignoring it as an interesting platform to develop on. Within 12 months, they figure it out and come out with a better version that's 512K. That's the version that people now really think about.\\n\\nDavid: That gets re-christened as like, that's the original Mac. The original original is the Mac 128 or something that.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. But in the meantime, Microsoft, the applications group is working their ass off to make something really great for the Macintosh, and they come up with Excel. What ends up happening is Apple's really trying to promote the sales of this machine. They view Excel and PageMaker as the killer apps, as reasons that people should buy this thing, because once you run through a lot of the demo apps and the stuff that Apple built, you're like, okay, what else is here? It's crickets.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Writing hello in script is cool, but like a lot of VR stuff, you're like, oh, that's a cool demo, but you're going to do that every day? No.\\n\\nBen: I'm not sure this has ever been publicly disclosed before, but Apple spent just as much marketing Excel as Microsoft did. They matched Microsoft's marketing spend with their own campaign for it and split the bill.\\n\\nDavid: That's amazing.\\n\\nBen: You've got a couple of concurrent things going on in applications land. You've got Excel coming out for Mac to take advantage of the GUI. This strategy is just all over the place, I think that's an interesting thing to underscore about Microsoft in this era. They're trying a ton of stuff because they're paranoid. They don't want to miss the next wave. Meanwhile, also in the applications group, Charles Simonyi has written Word. This is about a year before in 1983. Microsoft Word comes out for DOS.\\n\\nDavid: Right, and they ship it with a mouse.\\n\\nBen: Yes. This is like, okay, we see the Xerox PARC stuff coming out in the Mac. Great, Excel will be for that. We want to develop Word. We're going to do that for DOS. But I can imagine how useful the mouse is going to be in a word processing environment. They actually ship a mouse tied to the application that's not a part of DOS. This is how early we were in figuring out what the split between applications and platforms were at this point in history. Microsoft thought maybe a mouse makes sense just for this one application, even though it doesn't do anything else for the rest of the command line interface.\\n\\nDavid: It was all being figured out. I think it is also really fair to say that Microsoft was right there with Apple in the Mac development phase. Obviously, they're working on Excel, working on other what would become the Office Suite applications together for Mac.\\n\\nSteve Jobs shows Bill Gates the Mac project in 1981, three years before it ships. Microsoft and Apple signed an agreement to work together on applications for it in 1982. They were very deeply embedded on this, which is going to make the lawsuit and what comes up in a minute here all the more funny.\\n\\nBen: The decision for the Excel team is to focus on GUI. The whole marketing message is Excel on a Mac is better than Lotus 1-2-3 on a PC. You're starting to see truly divergent cultures at Microsoft between the systems group, which is currently making DOS.\\n\\nWe'll soon make Windows, soon partner with IBM, or soon do something else that we're getting into here in the next chapter of the story, and the applications group, which is also currently a bunch of disparate applications and teams targeting disparate platforms, but is also about to become unified in their next chapter. Within the applications group, that next chapter is Microsoft Office.\\n\\nIn 1985, in January, the bundle is released. It was originally called the Business Pack for Microsoft. It started on the Mac.\\n\\nDavid: It really rolls off the tongue.\\n\\nBen: Totally does. They haven't acquired PowerPoint yet or forethought as we talked about eight years ago on Acquired way back in history. There's no PowerPoint, it's not part of the bundle. What you've got here on the Mac and the first version of Office is Word, which they've developed in house, File, Chart, and Multiplan. This first notion of a suite, so today we're very familiar with suite—Creative Suite over at Adobe. Software is sold this way. This was the first time.\\n\\nWhat was actually happening is all of the bundling was happening in pricing, in marketing, and in manufacturing. You had a single box that they would ship with the different applications by 1988 or 1989. It was Word, Excel, PowerPoint. They're very different things, but they're getting bundled together in a way to be sold to customers, but there's no product integration.\\n\\nYou don't have the ability to do this very nice copy-paste from an Excel table and just paste that into Word. That whole idea is pretty far away. In this earliest Microsoft Office, it was just, how can we bundle something for a cheaper price if you buy all three and make marketing easier for us to have this unified message?\\n\\nDavid: Soon to come—and we'll get into Windows here in a second—one of the big killer app for productivity in particular for business productivity with a graphical user interface like Windows and true multitasking, you can get copy-paste from Excel into PowerPoint. Lotus and the world back in the command line interface where you've got these programs running on top of DOS, that is a completely foreign concept.\\n\\nBen: Right, none of those verbs exist.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. We've now set the stage of Microsoft's doing a lot of stuff. They're hedging a lot of bets, they're not totally sure which strategy is going to win out, they're not sure which platform is going to win out. They're not sure if they're more of a systems company or an application company, but what they are unified on is we make great software for personal computers. I think anything that fell into that purview, they were willing to explore.\\n\\nThey didn't really have hard boundaries between, we'll do anything to make our operating systems great, or we'll do anything to advantage our applications. Even we think we're an enterprise company, we think we're a consumer company. They just didn't have well formed opinions yet. It was just we make software for personal computers.\\n\\nDavid: At this point in time, the actual boundary between an operating system and an application is very fluid.\\n\\nBen: You've got a mouse that works for one program.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Lotus would really go down a dead end evolutionary path with Notes later in its life and its final chapter, where the application was going to be the operating system.\\n\\nBen: Right. Lotus Notes was crazy. It was a word processor, an email service, and it was a platform on which you could write other applications.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and it itself was an application.\\n\\nBen: It's crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Not an operating system. It was all dynamic. Speaking of though, Microsoft here is in bed with Apple, working on the Mac. Bill and the company are big believers in the future of the graphical user interface. Starting in 1983, they're like, we got to do our own graphical operating system or at least user interface. This is the origins of the Windows product. They actually announced it in November, 1983, before the Mac ends up shipping, which their partner, Apple, is of course not happy about.\\n\\nJust development of the Mac was rocky, development of Windows was super freaking rocky within Microsoft, too. This is around that same time when Paul Allen gets Hodgkin's disease and leaves the company. His presence as great technical leader is very much missed, but they bring in someone from Xerox to manage the development of Windows.\\n\\nThat person ends up not working out, he gets fired. Steve Ballmer gets drafted to come in and be the dev manager for the final push to release Windows 1.0, which is hilarious. You can find amazing YouTube videos from the launch and all joking about how non technical Steve coming in to Save the day and dev manage windows to launch.\\n\\nBen: Which is so funny. I don't think at this point in history, the lines were clearly formed among the executives yet. Steve wasn't running the global sales force, and Microsoft wasn't an enterprise company.\\n\\nDavid: No, we're going to get to that later.\\n\\nBen: Steve was one of the smart executives, they were a software company, and someone had to manage getting the software out the door. Windows 1.0 comes out. It's bad.\\n\\nDavid: It's bad. November 1985, Windows 1.0 is a very, very different thing than you imagine a graphical user interface is today or what you know of as Windows. It was tiled. It was not overlapping Windows that you can drag around and have one over the other. When you opened a program in Windows 1.0, the system created a literal window of it on your screen, and then it dynamically resized the windows as you open other applications. Nothing could ever be on top of each other. As you open more and more stuff, the windows get smaller and smaller and smaller. It's very bizarre.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. The idea of windows overlapping on top of each other, that was a uniquely Mac thing and a thing that smart engineers at Apple figured out how to do that in a performant way that offers good user experience. I would classify Windows 1.0 as a half step between command line and an actual graphical user interface.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, 100%. I believe Microsoft and Apple actually did a licensing agreement while they were working together during this time that said, hey, Microsoft can use a lot of the stuff that's being developed for Mac for Windows 1.0.\\n\\nBen: Yes, that's right. Apple does do a deal to license a lot of \\\"their intellectual property\\\" which of course came from Xerox, to Microsoft. Apple, I think, was under the impression that it was just for Windows 1.0, but the actual terms of the agreement are this and all future versions of Windows, which comes back to haunt Apple later. But yes, they totally get the license.\\n\\nDavid: Also, by the time that this agreement actually happens, I think Steve Jobs has been ousted, so it's Scully who does this agreement. People in Apple would look back on this for years and be like, this was a huge error.\\n\\nThe other important thing about Windows during this awkward teenage phase is it's not an operating system. It's just a graphical interface on top of DOS.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: The original name for Windows was Interface Manager.\\n\\nBen: Isn't it crazy? In all of their early marketing, they referred to it as Windows, a graphical operating environment that runs on the Microsoft MS-DOS operating system. Actually, it was not until Windows 95 that Windows was its own operating system. It was in Windows 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups. It was a graphical operating environment.\\n\\nHere's the question. Why is Microsoft doing Windows? Obviously here, Microsoft knows they need to evolve DOS. They need to figure something out for the graphical world. David, are you telling me that Windows is the widely agreed upon future of the company and that's just a straight line?\\n\\nDavid: Obviously that's a setup there. Here's the other thing that's happening in the company at this time, and it's the bigger thing. It's the next phase of the IBM relationship. Windows, the Mac, all of this, are hedges for the company. Microsoft and Bill, in particular, were masters of hedging their bets in an uncertain technology future.\\n\\nHe was so great. The company was so great at making sure that whichever way the apple fell from the tree, as Jetson Huang put it to us in our interview, Microsoft was going to be positioned to catch it. A lot of people, including Bill and Microsoft themselves, believe that the way that apple was going to fall from the tree here was IBM and OS/2.\\n\\nBen: The IBM PC was such a big deal last time around. You would think that whatever IBM wants to do next is a pretty good way to ally yourself.\\n\\nDavid: What's going on here? IBM, obviously the PC was a huge success, but losing dominance of the ecosystem to the clones, this was bad. IBM wants to find a way to evolve the PC ecosystem back to being more IBM proprietary. They're going to make Microsoft come along for the ride here.\\n\\nThe way that they're going to do this is with the next generation of the PC ecosystem, they are going to make a whole new modern operating system. They're going to get rid of DOS. They're going to make this operating system in partnership with Microsoft, and it's going to be called, fittingly, OS/2. They are going to lock Microsoft up that they can't license it to anybody else. OS/2 is going to be proprietary to IBM hardware, just like the Mac operating system is proprietary to Apple hardware.\\n\\nAs powerful as Microsoft's become here, they're still the little brother to IBM. This is not great news for Microsoft. On the other hand, it's much better for them to be on the inside here with IBM working in bed with them than it would be to be on the outside looking in if IBM's vision comes true and they recapture control of the PC ecosystem.\\n\\nBill, Microsoft, the company, and Steve too as the manager of the account with IBM, commit themselves to Microsoft is all in on this vision of the future of OS/2, and IBM is our horse in the race.\\n\\nBen: This is such a crazy part of the story to me, because we just talked about how Microsoft discovered this amazing business model. With everyone needing to license DOS from them, they're taking over the world, and they're becoming the standard development platform. Why on earth, if all that is true, are they going to develop some software that's going to be locked to IBM computers?\\n\\nDavid: This is a recentralization attempt. Ballmer has this great, great, great quote about it. He says, \\\"This,” the IBM partnership at this time, “was what we used to call riding the bear. You just had to try to stay on the bear's back and the bear would twist, turn, and try to throw you off. But we were going to stay on the bear because the bear was the biggest, the most important. You just had to be with the bear. Otherwise, you would be under the bear.\\\" That was IBM at this point in time.\\n\\nReally, I think it was IBM essentially putting a gun to Microsoft's head and being like, well, you can be in bed with us on this future that we're going to re-centralize everything, or you can be everybody else and not be, and you'll lose.\\n\\nBen: Even though Microsoft's doing all these little hedges, Windows, this tiny little team that's 30 people or something, it's not the most prestigious place at the company. The people in the applications division may as well be on another planet by this point from the systems division. They're trying all kinds of crazy stuff. The company motto at this point is the next big thing is OS/2 and IBM, and we are the software vendor for that.\\n\\nDavid: Certainly Bill and I think Steve, too, they needed to tow the party line politically of expressing that, nope, OS/2 is the future. What we're doing with Windows and with the Mac is those are small things within the company. It's a super bizarre period in history, but IBM had also made a bit of a power play too with the later generations of the 16-bit era product they called the PC/AT. They used the Intel 286 chip instead of the Intel 386 chip. The 286 chip—this was an intentional decision on IBM's part—was good, but it wasn't great.\\n\\nBen: You say it was good, but not great. Bill Gates said it was brain dead.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Bill Gates called it a brain-dead chip.\\n\\nBen: I think you might be being charitable.\\n\\nDavid: I think it certainly was more powerful than the 8086, 8088, but it was nowhere near what the 386 could do. There's a bunch of technical aspects to this, but the most important takeaway is that the 286 was not really powerful enough to do a graphical user interface or to power true multitasking in a way that the 386 and then later the 486 would be.\\n\\nA big part of actually the Compaq story about how Compaq and the clones leap ahead of IBM is they're not deterred from coming out with 386 machines, which are way more powerful, can run Windows, can do all this stuff. That's how they start to separate from IBM.\\n\\nBen: That's right. That was a bet that company move where Microsoft was like, hey, Compaq, go make 386 stuff because we're going to make a really great 386 software. We need someone to be all in on that because IBM's not.\\n\\nDavid: This is the thing. Bill, Steve, and the company, they're having to tow the party line of expressing commitment to IBM, but really they're like, no, Compaq, go do the 386, we're going to do Windows.\\n\\nBen: Right, they're riling up the rebels.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. They are the rebels versus the empire here. Anyway, IBM, of course, sees all this. They made the decision not to go to 386 and to discourage it in the marketplace because they didn't want PCs to start creeping into the core enterprise mainframe IBM workloads, their core business. If that was going to happen, they wanted it to be IBM proprietary closed system. I think that was a big part of the impetus for this OS/2 initiative.\\n\\nBen: I see.\\n\\nDavid: This is the empire strikes back here.\\n\\nBen: They're basically trying to coop the PC movement back into IBM proprietary land.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. When OS/2 finally does come out in December 1987, predictably, as you can imagine here, it's not very good. The market does not like it. Thank God for Microsoft. Again, this probably was Bill's strategy all along that they hedged with Windows, with the Mac. That's clearly the future. The market is not going to accept OS/2 and a recentralization on IBM. Microsoft's just crushing it on the revenue side, even though OS/2 is a failure.\\n\\nBen: DOS and the applications were both great businesses by 1987.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Fiscal 1987, Microsoft does $350 million in revenue. Fiscal 1988, they do $600 million in revenue. Basically, none of this is from OS/2 and the IBM world. Towards the end of 1988 is when the wind starts really blowing away from IBM here.\\n\\nIn June of 1988, Microsoft hires Mike Maples, who is IBM's director of software strategy away from IBM to come head Microsoft's application software. What is Microsoft's application software strategy right now? It's the graphical user interface. It's everything that IBM isn't. The writing is starting to be on the wall here that divorce is coming between IBM and Microsoft.\\n\\nFinally, a year-and-a-half later in 1990, Windows 3.0 comes out. This is when they get it right. This is when there's enough installed base of 386 and 486 machines out there in the open PC ecosystem that you can have a really good, true multitasking, good UI, graphical user interface running on top of DOS.\\n\\nWindows 1.0 and Windows 2.0 only ever achieved 5% penetration of the DOS installed base. Windows 3.0 doubles that in the first six months. PC Computing magazine writes about Windows 3.0. May 22nd, 1990 will mark the first day of the second era of IBM compatible PCs. Microsoft released Windows 3.0.\\n\\nOn that day, the IBM compatible PC, a machine hobbled by an outmoded character-based operating system and 70s style programs, was transformed into a computer that could soar in a decade of multitasking graphical operating environments, aka everything OS/2 is not. Windows 3.0 gets right what its predecessors got wrong. It drives adequate performance, it accommodates existing DOS applications, and it makes you believe that it belongs on a PC.\\n\\nBen: That's awesome.\\n\\nDavid: That's what the press thought. Ben, I know you talked to a really important person in the Windows ecosystem and Microsoft internally at this time. What do you have for us?\\n\\nBen: We have to thank Brad Silverberg for helping us with this section. Brad led the Windows 3.1 team. He came in right after the 3.0 release and would eventually go on to lead the Windows 95 effort as the VP of the Personal Systems Division.\\n\\nBrad comes in, Windows 3.0 has just shipped. The first thing that is super, super obvious is as Brad observed everything going on with OS/2 land and everything going on with the core Microsoft culture, it was a complete clash. It was impossible for the pace of Microsoft. This is a super young group, all in their 20s. Some people in their 30s, but mostly 20s who just want to push the cutting edge, ship stuff.\\n\\nThink about Google in the early 2000s, just hire all the smartest people you can, set them loose, have creativity, and bump up against the edge of what's possible, both in terms of pushing the hardware, but also pushing even laws as we would later see. Let's just do what users love and see what happens. Let's just do what technology enables us to do and see what happens. That's the opposite of IBM's culture at this point. There's this huge cultural rift between what IBM needs and who Microsoft is at this point.\\n\\nWhat ended up happening with 3.0, it was unexpectedly loved. Microsoft was not really prepared for how much people were going to love the GUI, and with 3.1 it got really good. There was a small off site of the executives, and Bill and Steve basically decided that it was time to bet on Windows. That was the new strategy. Windows had always been plan B, and now suddenly it was plan A.\\n\\nWhen I say plan B, I don't mean thought they had a prayer of being plan A. It was 65 people that shipped windows 3.1. These were the misfits. It was not prestigious. The prestigious thing to work on at Microsoft was OS/2 and eventually Windows NT. But the Windows team in the Windows 3.0 era is almost the Mac team over at Apple. They were flying the rebel flag, they valued creativity over bureaucracy, even if it meant they weren't working on the prestigious thing.\\n\\nSuddenly, there's this huge strategic opportunity to become the standard independent of IBM if the platform is good enough, and then boom. The early reception to Windows is so good, it gives this glimmer of, that may seem really ambitious, but that opportunity is actually ours if we want to go seize it. Everyone took a big gulp and said, the GUI's the next big thing, users love this, let's take the ragtag group and promote them.\\n\\nDavid: This was, I think, the moment when Microsoft started to believe in themselves, really. If you look at the facts as we told the story, it was like, Bill did this great business deal with IBM, anticipated the rise of the clones in the first PC, won, and then Microsoft now was the thing, and IBM was the old thing. It wasn't until this. In this whole OS/2 thing, I think you can see, they felt like they were still little brother. They had to go along with what IBM dictated. Now they're like, whoa.\\n\\nBen: Why do we again?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, we're in control.\\n\\nBen: The press is making a big deal out of Bill Gates. Boy Wonder, he's the youngest ever billionaire at age 31. By the way, when Bill Gates became a billionaire, there were not lots of billionaires, there were 50 billionaires. All this lore around the company, it's like they can do no wrong. But inside the company, I think they're like, we don't know the future of technology. Any wave could break against us at any moment, and this is all tenuous. I think that chasm kept getting wider and wider and wider of internally feeling like they're screwed and externally it's seeming this is the next great thing.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I've got some fun stats on money and revenue around all this. In fiscal 1990, the year that Windows 3.0 shipped, Microsoft does $1.2 billion in revenue, making them the first software company ever to pass a billion dollars in revenue. Fiscal 1991, they do $1.8 billion. Fiscal 1992, they finally win the Apple copyright lawsuit around the GUI.\\n\\nBen: By the way, the way that they won that, a judge basically looked at the paper and said, Apple, you totally said in all the future versions of Windows, they can use your UI paradigms. For most of the counts, they're covered. For these other things that you're trying to ask them about, those are not actually defensible. It's just widely accepted that these are UI paradigms now, and you can't enforce any ownership over those. It basically got thrown out. Apple tried to appeal all the way up to the Supreme Court, who said no.\\n\\nDavid: That's right. Like we've been saying too, they both stole from Xerox.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Fiscal 1992 though, this is when Microsoft just blows the doors off. They do $2.8 billion in revenue in fiscal 1992, up from $1.8 the year before. That year, 1992 in October is when Gates finally passes John Kluge—Acquired OG fans, back to the LVMH episode—Gates passes John Kluge of Metromedia fame, media mogul to become the wealthiest person in America. Everything you're talking about, all the press comes around that.\\n\\nIn January 1993, the crowning moment happens. Microsoft passes IBM in market cap. They have inherited the earth. They have inherited computing. Supposedly. I don't know if this is 100% true. This is written in one of the books I read. I read this. The folks involved will have to confirm or deny.\\n\\nSupposedly, the next month after Microsoft passes IBM in market cap—we're now in February 1993—the IBM board is in disarray. The empire is going down. They fired the CEO. Tom Murphy of Capital Cities fame who is on the IBM board, supposedly comes out to Redmond to sit down with Bill and personally ask him to come and be the next CEO of IBM.\\n\\nBen: No way.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This is what I read. I don't know if this actually happened, but this is what I read.\\n\\nBen: Is that in Hard Drive?\\n\\nDavid: That's in Hard Drive, yeah.\\n\\nBen: Wow. Listeners, there are some unauthorized biographies that we tried to corroborate as many of the facts as we can. But the ones where David's saying he doesn't know a source, it's these unauthorized ones.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Gates obviously declines that. Whether or not that actually happened, spiritually, you could believe that happened. Bill and Microsoft are the new emperor here. This carries through to this day. We're going to tell in the next episode here, the antitrust, the fall, and all that, but not really. Microsoft's still the most valuable company in the world. They inherited the throne from IBM. It happens right here.\\n\\nBen: It's nuts. Suddenly, Microsoft feels the full weight of everything that you have to do to build a platform and be a steward of an ecosystem. Suddenly, this huge effort began to try and make developers successful. That's how Windows would be successful if it was a great platform for application developers to thrive on.\\n\\nCameron Myhrvold led the developer relations group basically to try and figure out, what do people want out of a platform, and how do we provide the APIs for them, the support, and everything in order to do that, all the documentation, all the help, everything? At the same time, Microsoft basically knew establishing a platform is brutal and requires bootstrapping a multi sided network of developers, users, and PC manufacturers.\\n\\nSo 3.1 had users excited, but it was still very early. They could have lost that throne. Developers were not really yet targeting Windows. Microsoft had to show, we make great applications for Windows, too. The applications group really had to start doing Windows 3.1.\\n\\nDavid: Right, because developers were targeting DOS at this point. They were probably preparing for OS/2. Some of them were targeting the Mac, Microsoft itself, but nobody was targeting Windows.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. You've got this big developer relations group effort that spins up. Meanwhile, there's a huge push with OEMs to get them to install Windows. At this point, they were still installing DOS or some people were actually installing nothing and requiring users to put operating systems on. There's a conceded push to get the OEMs to install 3.1.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and there are some people installing nothing. We should mention here, around this same time, this era, they move a lot of their OEM deals to a per processor licensing fee arrangement, which gets them in a lot of hot water with antitrust a few years later.\\n\\nBen: Okay, this happened from 1988 to 1994. David, explain the per processor licensing agreement.\\n\\nDavid: Here's how Microsoft (I think) would position it to their OEM partners. You could pay us a license fee for every machine you ship with DOS installed on it, or DOS and Windows. You can offer other OSes too. But rather than that arrangement, we'll give you a cheaper per unit deal because you're going to ship DOS on everything. DOS is the standard, and we want Windows to be the standard, and Windows is going to be the standard.\\n\\nWe'll make it more economically attractive to you, give you a lower per unit rate. If we just change the terms and say, instead of every unit you ship with, DOS or with Windows, every machine you ship, period, every microprocessor based machine that you ship, no matter what operating system is installed on us, just pay us a per processor rate. If you do that, you'll be paying us for every machine, whether you ship DOS or Windows on it or not, but you're going to ship DOS and Windows anyway.\\n\\nBen: You may as well take the cheaper rate.\\n\\nDavid: You may as well take the cheaper option. Obviously, what effect does this have on competition? There's now a very, very, very strong incentive never to ship any other operating system.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Basically, you're going to pay for two different operating systems, even though you're only putting one on if you ever load a different operating system on. Yes, it very strongly incentivizes you to never ever ever ship any other operating systems on your computers as a company.\\n\\nThis is of course the way that regulators would look at it in 1994. That would get Microsoft in some hot water, and they had to agree to stop doing this practice. The way Microsoft would look at it is, we're just helping our customers. Do you really think that these companies want to keep a whole separate ledger of what machines they shipped DOS on or Windows on versus what machines they shipped period? Wouldn't it just be easier if once a month or once a quarter, they could just report to us their total shipments like they have to report to their investors anyway, and then we'll just send them an invoice for all their machines?\\n\\nDavid: Totally. While antitrust and the government would seize onto this as a smoking gun, I think the reality is this was irrelevant in terms of the forces that made DOS and Windows the winners. They were already the winners by the time they started doing this.\\n\\nBen: If this had happened earlier, you could see how this would be more of a compelling way to get market share. But by the time they started doing it, they were already running away with the market.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Speaking of this new customer-friendly, buyer-friendly business practice from Microsoft, which I think is how they thought about it...\\n\\nBen: Totally. They wanted to make the stuff that people wanted to use the most, and that's how they would win. Their goal was make the very best products, the best software we possibly can in the ways that people want to use and buy software, and then we'll make a bunch of money.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. As this changing of the guard is happening from IBM to Microsoft, I think part of this new self confidence from Microsoft is, wait a minute, why can't we go win the enterprise too and take that from IBM? We don't have to get in bed with them to sell to the enterprise. We should sell to the enterprise.\\n\\nBen: The thing they were realizing is, well, we have made software that people like to use, so they're using it in businesses. They always wanted that to be the goal, but now it was happening. People are doing their work in Excel. People are bringing PCs to the office.\\n\\nMaybe businesses are buying their PCs, but people are actually buying them themselves and using them in the office. It just made them that much more efficient. Microsoft really had to figure out how to sell to businesses, but we actually have no idea how to do that. It sounds crazy today. The Microsoft you know today, as late as the mid-90s, really had no idea how to sell or build software for businesses.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. This is the first half of the original Microsoft vision statement coming true, a PC on every desk and in every home. Desk means work, means enterprise. In this era, everybody we talk to, gives 100% of the credit to Steve Ballmer.\\n\\nSteve took it on his shoulders at this point in time when Microsoft is passing IBM to say, I am going to build, and we are going to learn as a company how to sell to enterprises. Ben, like you're saying, it's impossible to imagine now Microsoft not like this, but there's so much that they needed to do that they didn't have.\\n\\nBen: In part because prior to this, personal computers were not used by enterprises. It was just not an enterprise tool. Now that it was happening, Microsoft had to figure out how to be the ones that would benefit from it.\\n\\nDavid: That meant selling to the C-suite at global Fortune 500 companies, most of whom did not use computers.\\n\\nBen: Correct. Certainly, it didn't want to buy operating systems one at a time.\\n\\nDavid: Right. To the extent, members of the C-suite like CIOs or proto IT organizations used computers or were the computing centers in the company, they hated the PC. It made their life hard. This was when employees would bring a PC to work, plop it down on their desk, and start mucking around with stuff. It made things hard.\\n\\nBen: And there really isn't yet a business server that couples nicely with the PC on the desk. You have this weird thing where there's a mainframe that is where the company's real enterprise applications run, but people are bringing PCs. Those PCs don't actually communicate well with anything else yet. They just are there for the employee to do their own work on a spreadsheet or something, print it out because finally 3.1 had printer drivers, and then deliver that. But it wasn't a system that operated with other systems in your enterprise.\\n\\nDavid: There's no email. This really was a business transformation task for the global Fortune 500.\\n\\nBen: It wasn't like, hey, let's sell something to businesses that they want to buy. It's, hey, let's convince businesses that PCs are a good idea for their workforce to adopt.\\n\\nDavid: This was partnering with the consulting firms. This was building a direct sales force within Microsoft. This is building an indirect sales force within Microsoft to partner with distribution partners, with channel partners, with independent software vendors. This is building a customer service organization. This is building the executive briefing center on the Microsoft campus, and bringing CEOs and other C-suite folks there to Microsoft. It's building solutions for them, it's becoming a partner. It's everything that Steve is frankly just born to do.\\n\\nBen: All of this stuff is pretty out of scope for this episode, including all the software systems you would need to build for the enterprise like Windows NT server, Exchange, SQL server, and Active Directory, the classic mid-2000s Microsoft stuff that they got known for. That is what this would all evolve into, and it really just started with everyone looking at Steve and saying, can you figure this out?\\n\\nWe've all to date basically just been either running dev teams, running marketing, or running product groups, and been selling through retail or distributors in the application side or mostly through OEMs on the systems and operating system side. But can you go figure out how to sell everything we make in a completely different way to a completely different buyer profile and keep us posted on how that needs to change all the products we make in order to do that? That's a pretty crazy change.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. How it actually goes down, and we heard this from Steve and you heard it from other people, is so fitting. By the end of 1990, the Microsoft-IBM divorce is official. IBM takes full control of OS/2 development back from Microsoft. Microsoft ceases involvement. The breakup is official. This now gives Microsoft and Steve hunting license in the enterprise to go compete against IBM, but they have a secret weapon that is going to enable them to come take the enterprise from IBM. Ben, tell us what it is.\\n\\nBen: It's painfully obvious. It's Microsoft Office, and it's the fact that the whole workforce is already using Microsoft Office. Everyone loves to talk about product-led growth and how it's this new thing in the late 2010s, how Slack, Atlassian, Trello, and everyone figured out PLG. This bottoms-up workforce-adopted way, rather than selling to procurement, IT, or the central administrator. And it's just not new.\\n\\nDavid: No. This has always been the case, and Microsoft invented it.\\n\\nBen: All the employees wanted to use Excel and Word. They were doing it anyway. At some point Microsoft needed to figure out how to take advantage of selling it centrally and how you do business with other businesses, rather than selling a zillion retail copies of people who are using it illegally for their work.\\n\\nDavid: There's so many things that are beautiful about this. It's the legacy of this bet on the Mac, bet on Excel, and bet on Windows shortly thereafter, that enables Microsoft to go into the enterprise because even though they've just broken up with IBM and OS/2 isn't going anywhere, it's not like Steve can just go knock on the door of some banking CEO or C suite and be like, I'm Microsoft, come talk to me about how you're going to use Microsoft products in your organization. But rather it's like, hey, thousands of people in your organization are already using Excel. Let's have a conversation about how we can make that work better for your organization, and what else Microsoft can do for you.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely. Next episode is going to be all about the enormous success of becoming an enterprise company, the enterprise agreement, cloud, and everything that came after that. But we have two chapters left in this episode, and they happen concurrently within the systems group by two very, very different teams, and that is Windows 95 and Windows NT.\\n\\nDavid, let's start with NT, and then our little cherry on top can be 95 to close us out. How did Windows NT happen?\\n\\nDavid: Perfect, and it's intertwined with the beginning of all this enterprisification of Microsoft. Okay, Windows NT. Remember, IBM's whole goal with OS/2 was that they saw the trajectory of the PC was going to eat into traditional mainframe type applications in the enterprise. They wanted to recentralize and own the PC enterprisification of workloads. NT is, after the divorce, Microsoft being like, screw that we're going to do the same thing and eat your lunch.\\n\\nThe initial work starts out of the work they had been doing on OS/2 with IBM. But then in October 1988, as they're heading towards divorce, Microsoft hires Dave Cutler away from DEC. Dave is an absolute beast and legend. He's still writing code at Microsoft today, which is amazing.\\n\\nBen: Isn't that crazy? He's in his 80s.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing. Dave at DEC wrote the whole operating system that DEC ran on VAX. Poaching him away to come work at Microsoft, he's the guy that's going to build an enterprise-ready, take share away from the way traditional enterprise computing is done onto the PC. He's got the chops to do this, he's also got the credibility to do this.\\n\\nBen: He's written a widely-deployed enterprise operating system.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Him coming to Microsoft, him leading and building this effort, gives Steve and the sales force so much legitimacy when they're going in and talking to the C-suites, the CIOs, the IT departments, and enterprises.\\n\\nBen: Even though they don't yet have an enterprise product to sell, they've got DOS and early Windows, which is essentially consumer-targeted, but now they've got this guy, Dave.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, now they've got Dave.\\n\\nBen: We should say, this is really the first time they brought in someone who had real industry experience. In 1988, Microsoft was 13 years old, so Bill Gates would have been 33. Everyone is in their late 20s and early 30s, and Dave's mid-40s. He's like, you know I've seen a few things.\\n\\nDavid: I think it was Dave and also Mike Maples coming from IBM too. Mike obviously wasn't a technical leader but on the business and strategy side, too. NT, we'll talk a lot more about it on the next episode. But spoiler alert, it is the vision of what IBM wanted OS/2 to be, but it's Microsoft's version of it.\\n\\nBen: It enables all of your desktop computers at the company to join and network together in a compliant way. It enables an internal server that everything communicates with. It enables a directory of all the devices on the network and all the people in your organization.\\n\\nDavid: Soon with the Internet coming, it'll enable servers that face externally from your company. The punchline here is that NT becomes the seeds of Windows Server, the business line, which become the seeds of Azure today.\\n\\nBen: The other important takeaway on NT is it was going to take a long time to build. It was going to take a long time to test. It was going to take a long time to sell and deploy, and it was going to have really strict requirements for what it could work on because it's a power hungry operating system built for enterprise IT administrators. That is not your short-term product strategy. That is a long-term bet that a team is going to work on concurrently while you're figuring out what to do after Windows 3.1.\\n\\nIn 1991, Bill Gates sums this up in a memo where he says, “Our strategy is Windows. One evolving architecture, a couple of implementations, and an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others.” Every word in that sentence does a bunch of heavy lifting.\\n\\nYou got one architecture. Okay. I think what that basically ends up meaning a few years later is one application programming interface (API) that developers can target so that when they want to write a Windows app, it works on both NT and whatever the evolution of 3.1 is. That's one architecture, but it says one evolving architecture. That buys Microsoft a little bit more fluidity in the one architecture that's being targeted.\\n\\nThen you hear a couple of implementations. This basically says, even though developers are targeting what became the Win32 API, the one way that we write applications, there are two different implementations. For many years, they would display very differently on NT systems versus—spoiler alert—Windows 95, the successor to Windows 3.1.\\n\\nDavid: By Windows 95, you mean Windows 4 that was supposed to ship in 1993?\\n\\nBen: Yes, I do, but it's so much sexier to say Windows 95 and name it after the year that it actually ships. Yes, an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others sheds light on the DRG (Developer Relations Group) strategy. We got to go out and be massive evangelists, and everyone in the systems group is looking over at the apps group going, did you see that? Bill Gates just said our strategy is Windows. We're now the Windows company, and that includes great applications from Microsoft and others.\\n\\nWhat does that mean, applications group? Let's go first and best on Windows, get to it. I just think that sentence says it all for what we're looking at 1991 through call it 2000 or so.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. We just spent a bunch of time talking about the enterprisification and all the amazing enterprise stuff that the seeds get sewn from Microsoft at this point in time. This era is also the heyday of the consumer PC. In 1993, Jensen starts NVIDIA, graphics cards are becoming a thing. PC gaming is becoming an industry. You can even look at Minesweeper as being a seminal moment in terms of the consumerization, these devices, these personal computers becoming companions to people's lives like the phone is today. You've got CD-ROM technology, multimedia, Encarta. The heyday of the consumer PC is here in this era.\\n\\nBen: Totally. Even before Windows 95 shipped, they had 75 million Windows users. This is even before you get plug-and-play, multimedia, or networking. This is on Windows 3.1. Crazy.\\n\\nWe've been leading up to what we've been building hype, Windows 95, or should I say Chicago? The Chicago name, for those of you out there who were paying attention when this was under development, and you were all excited about what Windows 95 would become—and it's probably 1% of our audience or something who knows the Chicago code name—they wanted to create an OS for the everyman, one that was easy to get to, a nice quality of life when you're there, it was affordable. Chicago is the perfect name in every way. It is also a contrast to what was going on in a different part of Microsoft, where there was the codename of Cairo for a very ambitious next generation operating system.\\n\\nMind you, NT had already come out in 1993. Cairo is this general bucket of maybe it's post-NT, maybe it's part of NT, but this is a really sophisticated, crazy set of technologies that we're going to eventually bake into an operating system. It doesn't really have a release date. No one really believes in any of the release dates that are proposed.\\n\\nThe Windows 95 team, the Windows 4 team, the Chicago team, loved contrasting this idea of a far flung land that's really ambitious. Who knows what it'll actually be like? Chicago is something we know quite well. You get on I-90 from Seattle, you drive for three days, and you're there. That is the goal. That's the spiritual thing about Windows 95.\\n\\nDavid: Pizza, the bears, the cubs.\\n\\nBen: 100%. We should say, Cairo never shipped, so there's a lesson in that.\\n\\nDavid: Might as well been called Oz.\\n\\nBen: Or Longhorn.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Okay, all right, we're getting ahead of ourselves.\\n\\nBen: We are getting ahead of ourselves. Windows 95, let's start with the launch event itself. It was a huge, ridiculous, insane day in Redmond, Washington. They set up tents all over Microsoft's campus. They flew in journalists, beta testers. There was a movement around Windows 95 in a way that you would not believe. It was an operating system launch, and Jay Leno launched it. It wasn't like Jay Leno did some stand up, it was Jay Leno for 90 minutes in a tightly scripted environment, co-hosted with Bill Gates all of the fanfare and festivities.\\n\\nDavid: There is no other word to describe the Windows 95 launch besides glorious. I am so glad that this stuff is preserved on the Internet and on YouTube, and that we could experience it ourselves over the past month.\\n\\nBen: It might be the peak moment of pure joy to celebrate technology before a lot of the skepticism came in and the tech haters.\\n\\nDavid: The DOJ.\\n\\nBen: Totally. It was unabashed celebration of software is probably the best way to put it. Microsoft license Start Me Up famously from the Rolling Stones.\\n\\nDavid: It's amazing, a software company licensed Start Me Up by the Rolling Stones as the official theme song of an operating system. The idea that this would be happening, certainly back in 1975 when they were moving to Albuquerque, but even just a couple of years earlier, this is breaking new ground.\\n\\nBen: Totally. The other thing that's happening in 1995 is the Internet hype is starting to build, but we will table that for next episode. Right at this point in history, only 14% of Americans had internet access. It was still very early, so there was no guarantee that any story posted online would actually reach the masses. Microsoft had really relied on traditional broadcast coverage of this event, and brought in all these journalists, all these print magazines, and all these newspapers to build the hype.\\n\\nI watched the whole keynote yesterday. At the end, they ripped down the back of the tent behind the stage. There's the entire development team in the red, yellow, green, and blue squares of the Windows logo sitting outside on the big sports field on Redmond's campus. There's only 360 people that built Windows 95, so it's still a small team, but they're all there. They're fired up. They're part of the moment. That's the launch event in Redmond, at least.\\n\\nAround the world, people are lined up around the block to buy an operating system. There's a lot of news coverage of that. It was basically the iPhone launch of its day. They lit up the CN Tower, the Tower of London. This date, August 24th, 1995, they basically treated an operating system launch the way that you would launch a movie or a new Madonna album. It was a marketing case study, so much so that the folks from Coca-Cola actually reached out to Microsoft to ask them, how do you do marketing this well in the new age?\\n\\nDavid: To the Bill Gates quote with the Warren Buffett talk at U-Dub.\\n\\nBen: Yes. This is a company that freaking invented Santa Claus to sell us all sugar water, and they're calling Microsoft asking, how do you market in this new era? It was that successful. They launched concurrently worldwide in eight languages. This thread that Microsoft had of early international continued all the way through to this moment. They invested heavily in doing all of the localization and help stuff so that the whole world really could adopt something all at one time. It really was the perfect product at the right time, the Internet, games, all of that.\\n\\nDavid: There's so much about Windows 95 too that I'm sure you're going to get into, but the start menu. It was so perfect because this was the peak of the PC going fully mainstream. Nobody had ever treated software like this before.\\n\\nBen: That's the takeaway. They thought about software in a completely different way. Yes, the start menu, while it got cluttered, complicated, and messed up over time, the idea of a button that you click to start using your computer was very appealing to people.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. The Mac obviously shared a lot of these elements, but it was at so much a smaller scale.\\n\\nBen: The Mac just never had any real PC penetration. From the IBM PC forward, it never had big market share.\\n\\nDavid: This was your grandmother coming into the digital world.\\n\\nBen: That is how they tried to market it. They market it as people on job sites using Windows. They marketed it as people doing crafts. There's someone who's modeling something for an F1 car. It's just fun watching all these old videos and seeing all the different personas.\\n\\nDavid: Computer companies love F1 cars for demos. It's the ultimate aspirational demo.\\n\\nBen: I must say this all pains me deeply as someone who never owned a PC, grew up using a Mac, loved every bit of my Mac. I was even an apologist in the OS-9 era of this isn't very good, but I'm still going to say it's good. I was on the OS-10 public beta. I only clicked a start menu when I was fixing a teacher's computer at school. Even though the takeaway here is everyone thought this was a great operating system and it won the market, I always looked at it like, well, it's not a Mac.\\n\\nDavid: That's how Mac users always look at Windows.\\n\\nBen: The way that Apple products became mainstream always felt odd to me as someone who was using them when they weren't, but it's been interesting gaining a new appreciation for Microsoft through studying their history that I absolutely did not have as a user during this era.\\n\\nDavid: Having this discussion now makes me think, Windows 95, they did what Apple tried to do in bringing Scully in. Scully came from Pepsi. Obviously, that didn't work, but Microsoft, they're the ones who did it. They're the ones who mass-marketified the computing vision.\\n\\nBen: It was the wrong strategy for Apple, and it was the right strategy for Microsoft. Apple has always, at least in my opinion, created a better computing experience by being completely integrated. It's the Alan Kay quote, \\\"Anyone who cares about making great software needs to build their own hardware.\\\" The complete integrated package that Apple offers, I have always found to be the best computing experience. And it doesn't scale.\\n\\nDavid: It didn't in that era for sure.\\n\\nBen: In that era, yeah. The way to scale is Make the software that is going to get distributed on the most PCs, and then that is the most interesting to software developers. It is the most interesting to consumers who want the software and IT buyers who want to buy the standard thing. Apple's strategy versus Microsoft strategy in this era, Apple was always going to be a bit player rather than the scale winner.\\n\\nThe trade off is lots of PCs had blue screens of death, Apple never had blue screens of death. Where do blue screens come from? It's driver problems. It's that the printer is not speaking the same language as your particular computer and what the operating system knows about your computer, and are the device drivers right for your particular version of whatever's on your motherboard? Apple never had those issues, but they also had very few units shipped and much more expensive product.\\n\\nDavid: Sidebar. That Alan Kay quote about if you really care about software, you do your own hardware, makes so much more sense to me now having done this episode, because he's coming from having made the Alto and the graphical interface there. The only way that he could have made the GUI on the Alto was basically building a mini computer.\\n\\nBen: Isn't that crazy?\\n\\nDavid: It makes so much more sense now.\\n\\nBen: A little bit more on Windows 95 before we finish the story here, it is remarkable to reflect that it took 5–6 years to go from Windows' plan B to Microsoft being extremely right that that was the franchise, that was the bet to bet the entire company on.\\n\\nAs Brad Silverberg put it this way to me, he said, Windows 95 cemented Windows as the franchise product for Microsoft, which interestingly it was not yet. David, this is crazy. It would remain the franchise product for the next 20 years, perhaps 5 or 10 years too long, but we'll save that story.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Just to put some numbers on this, August 24th, 1995 is the launch event, the glorious day. Windows 95 comes out. It sells a million copies in the first week, seven million copies in the first month.\\n\\nFiscal 1995—this is the 12 months ending in June before Windows 95 comes out—Microsoft did $5.9 billion in revenue. Fiscal 1996, they did $8.7 billion. Fiscal 1997 when Windows 95 is really going, they do $12 billion in revenue. First software company to pass $10 billion in revenue, already the most valuable company in the world. They are a monster. There is no other way to put it.\\n\\nBen: It's crazy. From a product perspective, there was just so much really got smoothed here. This was a user experience where they finally had time to think, what actually do users want to do with an operating system? What features should be part of the OS, and what should we delegate to applications? What are modern networking technologies that we should bring in?\\n\\nI don't want to foreshadow too much, but how should the Internet be in a modern operating system? That was a huge thing. The multimedia, the video stuff. An operating system really showed up and said, we thought about this experience for you. You're looking for where to start, you're looking for cool stuff to do, and you're looking for it to not break on you. We now finally have a complete story around all of that.\\n\\nA couple of interesting technical notes, it was basically all new technology. If you try to look this up, it will tell you, Windows 95 was DOS-based. It still used DOS in fallback situations for older DOS applications or drivers. But for most of the time, it was no longer true that Windows was just an operating environment on top of the DOS operating system.\\n\\nWindows had now become a true 32-bit operating system of its own. Windows did all the heavy lifting. It had its own file system. It accomplished a lot of the user experience magic and speed that it was praised for by rewriting a lot of this from scratch. This was the beginning of Windows as its own OS. You can see that actually change in the marketing messages that change from operating environment to operating system.\\n\\nDavid, that brings us to the end of our chapter one. We've got plenty of analysis here to do, but my God, what a first 20 years for the company.\\n\\nDavid: We knew this was going to happen. This is why we waited 10 years into Acquired's life to cover Microsoft. It's the most important company in the world still today.\\n\\nIt was so fun researching, going back and doing all this because there are so many different perspectives, and so much has been written. I don't know if we've gotten it right here, but I feel like every other major attempted storytelling at this has not gotten it right. Getting to go talk to all the people who were part of this...\\n\\nBen: Yeah, living in Seattle is quite helpful.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. We really got that sense of like, there's still a story to be told here. It's never been more relevant again than today. All that to say, I'm glad we waited 10 years.\\n\\nBen: And there's all this stuff we miss. I didn't mention Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research was a lot of people and a lot of money.\\n\\nDavid: Microsoft tried to buy Intuit too along the way. That got canned.\\n\\nBen: Actually, the start of research is interesting. I'll say this real quick. In 1991, Nathan Myhrvold started Microsoft Research, and the logic is fascinating. Basically, everything Microsoft had done until that point was taking things from mainframes and mini computers, and adapting those tasks, those jobs to be done for personal computers.\\n\\nAt some point, they looked around and said, all right, well, we did it. All the personal and business applications can now be run on personal computers, so we have to come up with uses for future technologies in order to continue to drive the ecosystem forward. There's no more low hanging fruit. I thought that was an interesting thesis of why to spin up a research division at that point in history.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Let's move into analysis.\\n\\nBen: Okay, great. Playbook. The big interesting one that I want to start with, and it actually involves a chapter from the story that we just glossed over, is capital efficiency allows founders to control their own destinies in a way that you just don't get when you're selling off huge chunks of the company in order to accomplish your mission.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, I love this.\\n\\nBen: Let's just talk through the cap table over time and how the company went public. We talked about the partnership being 64% Gates, 36% Paul Allen. In 1980, Steve Ballmer comes in and gets 8.5%, 8.75%, or something that percent of the company, so dilutes Gates and Allen down.\\n\\nIn 1981, just a year later, they take the VC investment for 5% of the company from TVI. This also, I'm guessing around 5% trying to reverse engineer some of the numbers. They also created an option pool, where they were then creating opportunity for basically rewarding management, which is how there were 10,000 millionaires created in the Seattle area from Microsoft.\\n\\nDavid: That's the amazing thing. The option pool doesn't get created until late in Microsoft's life. All those Microsoft millionaires only came from whatever size that was, 5% of the company or whatever.\\n\\nBen: At IPO, even with all this dilution, you've got the Ballmer dilution, the VC dilution, and the option pool dilution, Bill Gates still owned 49% of the company. That's pretty unprecedented. He wasn't the only one with a big chunk. Paul Allen owned 28% of the company. Steve had 7.5% of the company.\\n\\nThis company was basically owned by the three more or less co-founders. A little tiny option pool, and then a VC who ended up with 6.1%. I think Dave got some more shares from being on the board. You just don't see companies that look this anymore.\\n\\nDavid: This is Bill's company. This is their company in a way that no other company is these days. No venture-backed company going through the modern era is like that. By the time you get to be public, you may still be the largest shareholder as a founder or CEO, but it's not your company, far from it.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely. I'm trying to figure out why they were able to be so capital efficient. Is it just that software was such an unbelievably good business model compared to everything else that existed? They didn't need a lot of working capital, everything was high margin, they could grow really fast. Or it was just an era before much competition. They didn't need to out-raise their competitors. Once they got a little bit ahead, there was really no way for anybody else to close the gap, assuming that they executed well.\\n\\nDavid: I totally think it's the latter. I think it's that the minimum fixed cost threshold to be that, in Bill's words, slightly better than your competitors and get the positive spiral going, was low enough that it could be paid for just in Bill and Paul's time and effort. There was that unique moment at the beginning of the software industry where that was true, and that would never be true again.\\n\\nBen: That's so, so, so insane. There was no one else really with the knowledge either. Even if someone else came in with a big $1 million check and gave it to a competitor, in 1975, how many people could really write these language interpreters?\\n\\nDavid: You couldn't buy the experience having written emulation software for microprocessors that Paul had.\\n\\nBen: They had an obsession and an obscure skill that turned out to be one of the most valuable in the world in an area where there was a freak law of nature in play with Moore's Law that was so unintuitive, that you had to think from real first principles to understand the impacts of it.\\n\\nDavid: I think there are two freak laws of nature's one. (1) There was Moore's law that they were benefiting from. (2) There was the zero marginal cost of software.\\n\\nBen: That's true. It's this complete perfect storm that enabled them to build a highly defensible business without really any investment ever. This is the largest company in the world, the most valuable company in the world that was entirely bootstrapped.\\n\\nDavid: Even though they raised money, not a single dollar of investment actually happened at this company.\\n\\nBen: No, and in 1986, when they actually did go public, they raised $45 million. They never spent that because they generated much more free cash flow than that that year.\\n\\nDavid: It was just a means to an end of getting public.\\n\\nBen: And they needed to for the reason that they had been granting so many stock options from that little option pool to employees that they were going to blow the SEC's 500 shareholder cap. They projected 1987, so they wanted to go public on their own terms in 1986, not when they had to buy SEC rules.\\n\\nDavid: Also, Microsoft needed to be a public company. If you're going to be an important company in the world at this scale, if you're going to first ride the bear with IBM but then inherit the earth from IBM, you got to be a public company. You can't be a private partnership. You're not going to go have conversations with C-suites and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies if you are a private partnership in this era especially.\\n\\nBen: Maybe. I don't know. I'd agree with you if you had a bunch of short-term capital interests that owned your company, but if it's all founder-owned, there are great, large private companies in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, fair, true.\\n\\nBen: Coke Industries is a trusted company by a whole bunch of their customers. Cargill is even bigger than that. There's a bunch of European industrial and shipping companies. Rolex. There are privately-held, big, important companies in the world.\\n\\nDavid: For sure, but none of those companies are Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: That's true. That's very fair. Especially getting to the stage that they eventually got to being the trusted partner to governments around the free world, that requires being a public company.\\n\\nDavid: It's funny. This playbook theme, this was a moment in time and a set of factors where this worked. I guess the lesson is find an industry in its infancy, be capital-efficient, and run the table.\\n\\nBen: That has unique economic conditions that have never existed before to create these magical businesses you could never fathom before this new technology thing existed? It's an impossible thing to wish for. It may never happen again. We may never get another Google either.\\n\\nDavid: That's what I was going to say, it did happen again, it happened with Google.\\n\\nBen: But how many things can you collapse to zero? I think that's the question. With Microsoft, they were able to collapse their marginal cost to zero, but they still had distribution costs, and then Google collapsed distribution costs to zero with the Internet. What's a big cost that a company has now? Maybe AI will collapse. You no longer need 50,000 employees, you can have five employees. Maybe it can collapse that to zero.\\n\\nYou need something of that scale, which is, where does a company spend most of its money that suddenly it can spend no money on? I suppose actually it is on the human capital. You just look at big successful companies and look at what they spend money on. Those are the candidates.\\n\\nDavid: Good point. Still unlikely we'll ever find another Microsoft opportunity.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Other fun things on the IPO, do you know who IPO'd the day before Microsoft did?\\n\\nDavid: No.\\n\\nBen: Oracle. Oracle had a nice pop, which actually helped Microsoft price a little bit higher in their IPO. That is another episode we have to do.\\n\\nAnother thing adds yet another layer to the insanity of everything that we've been talking about of why they were able to build such a successful company on such little capital, I don't think there has ever been a tailwind in history like the one that Microsoft had with the secular growth of the personal computer wave. The only thing I can think of that is comparable is Amazon with the growth of the Internet, powering their early growth.\\n\\nHere's the stat. From 1975 to 1986, 11 years prior to their IPO, so founding to IPO, PCs grew at a compound annual growth rate of 98%. It grew from 4000 units per year to 9 million units per year shipped. You can almost not mess up when you have a tailwind that.\\n\\nDavid: Especially when you are the linchpin player.\\n\\nBen: They managed to make themselves the point of integration for the whole industry. Oftentimes, I find myself when we're looking at these companies that are among the most successful in the world or like Microsoft, the most successful in the world, it's basically a multidimensional multiplication problem.\\n\\nThey had this unbelievable one in a zillion thing going for them, which you can multiply by this other one in a zillion multi thing. It's the zero marginal cost, zero distribution cost, unbelievable secular growth of the PC, Moore's law happening. They're the single choke point for the whole industry. It's just crazy how many things you multiply together, and of course it should end up in a number over three trillion.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. I'll jump in with a playbook theme that we referenced a little bit in the episode, but we really got a highlight here. Bill, Steve, Paul, and everybody at Microsoft, were incredibly talented, incredibly smart. They saw the future in a way nobody else did, but they also were willing to hedge their bets.\\n\\nIt's not like they just got everything right. They were going to get things wrong with OS/2, but they hedged the bets with Windows. I think that is such a key lesson of when you're in a really dynamic market like this, in our ecosystem right now in tech, venture capital, startups, whatnot, people put so much value on conviction. I have conviction. This is what the future is going to be like. I think the Microsoft story is the opposite of that. They had conviction that software was going to be big.\\n\\nBen: And personal computers. Creating software for desktop computers was a really good idea, and they wanted to be the best at it.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, but the exact path of how that was going to play out, they had very little conviction and were willing to be very flexible.\\n\\nBen: You're right. It's both the hedging, but also then the ability to read the world and quickly, entirely change your strategy if you need to, and having your hedge be far enough along that you can jump quickly to it and shift your whole organization to get on board with it. That's a hard leadership thing to do.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I can't wait in the next episode to talk about the Internet tidal wave memo. That's related to your playbook theme too. You can't really do that if you don't own 49% of the company, if it's not your company.\\n\\nBen: Which I think you're seeing play out with most CEOs today. There's a big difference between a founder-CEO and the stuff that they can do. Zuckerberg with the metaverse or Jensen with betting the whole company and going all in again on AI versus Tim Cook or Sundar Pichai, certainly a very different type of CEO. Satya is interesting. Despite the fact that he doesn't own half the company, he's got a lot of founder-like control, which I think is pretty interesting.\\n\\nDavid: All right, don't get ahead of ourselves.\\n\\nBen: Moving along. Other playbook themes, a big one that jumps out to me is that new generations of technologies enable market dislocations. Unless you are in a transformational moment in terms of a new technology came out that enables something that wasn't possible before that's going to rearrange the whole value chain and open up new markets, it's pretty hard to go challenge an incumbent. No one was going to challenge IBM really until the microcomputer, even the minicomputer people. Did DEC really challenge IBM? Not really. It never made a dent.\\n\\nDavid: It wasn't a full platform shift in the same way.\\n\\nBen: And there are these little blips of it. The GUI I think meaningfully reshuffled the DECs. Those are the moments where you can have meaningful new entrants. Otherwise, you have to bide your time and just build your hedges and see.\\n\\nRelated, even if you are the incumbent being disrupted, it is possible to have a very, very large and durable revenue stream that can go on for a very long time. What I'm referring to in this particular example is despite all of the dethroning that we just talked about, Microsoft would not eclipse IBM in revenue. You mentioned market cap, David, but in revenue until the year 2015. Isn't that nuts?\\n\\nDavid: I intentionally didn't look up revenue because it made the story muddier, but wow, there you go.\\n\\nBen: I think that's the point. Microsoft's perception by the market, I'm sure they were growing faster, I'm sure they had better gross margins. I'm sure there was a better story there, so there's a multiple that comes out of the story. I'm sure there are lots of good reasons why Microsoft became more valuable than IBM very early, but IBM's revenue did not peak until 2012. What?\\n\\nLong after public perception moves on, customers still get value from something created by incumbents for a very long time. I think that's something we often forget about in the buzzy Twitterverse of like, oh that thing's over. It might still grow for another 20 years before it's over.\\n\\nDavid: That also just speaks to the nature of the enterprise business, too.\\n\\nBen: That's a good point.\\n\\nDavid: IBM was the enterprise business. Today, Microsoft is the enterprise business.\\n\\nBen: That's true. Peloton revenue can dry up a lot faster than contracts for mainframes. What do you got?\\n\\nDavid: A playbook theme that I want to highlight that really, really came out in our conversations is Microsoft was not just a talent magnet, the talent magnet during the PC era. If you were an ambitious young person, this is where you wanted to be.\\n\\nIt was on every dimension. If you were an ambitious young technical person, that's where you wanted to be. If you were an ambitious young salesperson, if you're an ambitious young marketing person, that's where you wanted to be.\\n\\nThey just had this culture there, which is so funny. We'll talk in the next episode of how that culture really fell apart for a while there. I asked a lot of these early people that we talked to, what was it being there? You guys worked yourselves half to death. Were you mad about that? Did you resent it? Were you just making Bill rich? They're all like, no. Yeah, we neglected every other part of our life, but that was the good old days. This was the magic, we were making it happen.\\n\\nBen: That totally comes through. I asked Brad, why did Windows 95 work? There's lots of structural reasons, but he said, we basically did two things. (1) We laid out principles for product and then pushed responsibility down. Developers were often their own PMs. There's this idea of once you got the principles, we don't need to write a zillion specs, design something three times, and pass it through three functions. You know the principles, make great software that follows the principles. (2) He said that everyone felt personally responsible for the product, and it really showed.\\n\\nDavid: Anybody you talked to from this era of Microsoft, this was their life's work. No doubt about it.\\n\\nBen: Something we touched on a little bit is the benefit of scaling with OEMs. This was the contrast against Apple, where I said Apple was always going to be a niche player by the way that they designed, built, and packaged everything themselves. Apple is in many ways like the AmEx, where Microsoft is the Visa.\\n\\nOn our Visa episode, it just became so clear that Visa could quickly take over the world at MasterCard by being an open network, where they didn't have to do all the work to scale themselves. They could distribute to a bank, partner with a bank, and then boom, each of the banks that was on their network could independently scale at their own rate, which created obviously compounding effects for how fast Visa and MasterCard could scale. The same can be said of Windows.\\n\\nDavid: Totally, the OEMs. Yeah.\\n\\nBen: I think the Microsoft OEM team for Windows was 20 people or something. Before the enterprise, in this era that we're talking about, the group of people responsible for go-to market for Windows was really small. They sold some retail, but the team was just about, hey, make sure HP and...\\n\\nDavid: Compaq, Dell, and Gateway.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. That was their go-to market, and it makes your scaling unbelievably efficient.\\n\\nDavid: Dude, you're getting a Dell.\\n\\nBen: Dude, you are getting a Dell. Similarly, I think the fact that they went international early was this very powerful constraint. It meant that every time they shipped software, they had to make it globally ready quickly. That meant that if there was any network effects to your software, anything becoming a standard, Microsoft was just way better positioned to become the standard than anyone else was.\\n\\nOn top of there being network effects, there's also scale economies. A word processor is a word processor. The extent that you have customers in every country who can buy your one piece of software, you can amortize the development costs over a huge user base so much more quickly.\\n\\nDavid: 100%.\\n\\nBen: The fact that they forced themselves to be international early meant that every product after that also had to figure out how to do all the localization, training, and all of that to get all those effects too.\\n\\nDavid: No matter how much time, money, and resources you have to spend to localize Microsoft word into kanji, it's a lot less time and resources and money than developing Microsoft word.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. They just realized that so early. They also realized that most people who were doing some localization would do a shoddy job. They would think about it as lesser than the US market. They just did a good job at localization. They just cared. They thought of it as this is a strategic pillar that in every country, everyone experiences our software to the same quality because it's our brand everywhere. I don't know. I just think that is not how the rest of the industry thought about it.\\n\\nDavid: Definitely not.\\n\\nBen: On top of all of this, the way that they executed it through subsidiaries was pretty genius. Redmond did not control international. They spun up country managers and subsidiaries in each of these countries in a ton of countries.\\n\\nWhile Redmond did the product development and then did the engineering work to do localization to all the strings files and everything for those countries, the actual marketing messaging, the sales strategy, and the sales structure, happened in country that was owned by a person who lived there so they actually could think through, what is the best way for people to receive this software here?\\n\\nAgain, that's just going to yield way better results than if you're sitting there armchair quarterbacking at Redmond thinking about how a person in Chile is going to receive your marketing message.\\n\\nOne other that I have is this one that we didn't really talk about, but Microsoft famously was not first to market with basically any of their applications. They aren't even really today in most cases. You think about the strategy that they had early on spreadsheets, word processing, all these were copycats at their outset.\\n\\nSometimes they would do an acquisition, but most of the time they just look at a product and say, huh, our software should do the same thing, and they would copy it. They had no shame in doing that. They had their eyes everywhere looking for good ideas, they had reverence for the good ones, and then they would just incorporate them.\\n\\nOn top of that, they wanted to make the software very easy to switch to. A lot of the keyboard shortcuts in Excel to this day are there because they were originally the Lotus 1-2-3 shortcuts. They wanted people to have the same muscle memory that just worked.\\n\\nFundamentally, what this does for you as a business is it just leads to better risk adjusted returns. You already know what's going to work before you ship it. You don't really take market risk. You're not going to be the first to the market with early adopters, but most of the time, you actually don't need to be to win.\\n\\nI think Microsoft own that idea. Most of the time people are sheepish about it. Steve Jobs famously said, Microsoft has no taste. I think that's another way to put it that it's copycatting.\\n\\nDavid: I do agree with the premise, with all of this. I think doing this episode though has made me think there's a little more nuance to it. Yes. In broad strokes, you can say that's what Microsoft strategy was with applications over the years, but the Microsoft versions never actually won until there was a platform shift that they could take advantage of to beat the incumbent.\\n\\nMicrosoft wasn't going to beat Lotus 1-2-3 until the graphical paradigm came along, and then Excel being graphical was just obviously so much better. They tried with Multiplan, they failed. Multiplan was fine, but 1-2-3 was the winner.\\n\\nThe nuance to me is yes, but it's more like with the resources of Microsoft and the timeframe that Microsoft can afford to have, they can afford to start building the application, start building the product, getting into market, start learning, be positioned that then when the paradigm shift comes, leap ahead.\\n\\nBen: That's a good point. It's also different. The Lotus 1-2-3–Multiplan thing, in that era, Microsoft just didn't have great distribution yet. Lotus 1-2-3 just got pretty far ahead of them, and Microsoft had no way to catch up. A few years after that, that would basically never be true again.\\n\\nDavid: That could be true too.\\n\\nBen: I will say, you touched on something that's an interesting corollary to this. Their first versions of software famously are not good. You look at Windows 1.0 and 2.0. They know that it's part of the strategy, and they were world class at learning from customers and integrating customer feedback into subsequent versions.\\n\\nThere's always this saying of Microsoft doesn't have a very good first or second version, but the third version of something is typically pretty good. I think that fact pattern definitely follows.\\n\\nDavid: I'm curious your thoughts on this. I'm so surprised. One thing that you have not brought up yet on this episode is you were a PM at Microsoft for several years.\\n\\nBen: I was, but it was such a different era in that 2012–2014 era. I guess 2011 is when I started as an intern. I'll have a lot of thoughts on it next episode.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, great. I've got one more playbook theme before we move on to power. Microsoft figured out software before anybody else, and they figured out so many aspects of what it means to be a software business before anybody else, but they figured out that software is never done.\\n\\nI do think a lot of their competitors, we didn't obviously didn't study Lotus to the same degree that we studied Microsoft here, we didn't study WordPerfect, et cetera, but I think there was a mindset that a lot of other folks are like, you ship software, and then the software was done.\\n\\nThat was not the culture at Microsoft. This is related to what you were just saying. Shipping software is the beginning. You are always working on that software. You're working on next versions and stuff, but even before the next version, the work of software is never done.\\n\\nBen: Of course, if you own the hardware, you definitely think of it more of like, well, we ship them, the big cabinet of things, we install it, and we fix it if it's broken, but we've sold them hardware. The software is required to run it, but the thing we sold them is the hardware. If you're a pure software company, you think about the world differently.\\n\\nYou're like, well, I can always ship you another CD, another floppy disk, over the Internet. It's obviously very different. But because there weren't really software companies before them, of course people didn't come from that mindset.\\n\\nDavid: I think you still see the legacy of this right to this day in Apple versus Microsoft. Apple still is on a yearly software release cadence, which is ridiculous. Whereas Microsoft is on the cloud, it's all constant. It's all constantly shipping. Look at AI, look at OpenAI. The software is never done so deeply in the software business model.\\n\\nBen: That's true.\\n\\nDavid: All right, should we move on to power?\\n\\nBen: Yes. Listeners who are new to the show, we do this section based on Hamilton Helmer's seven powers framework. The question is, what is it that enables a business to achieve persistent differential returns, or to put in another way, to be more profitable than your closest competitor and do so sustainably?\\n\\nThe seven are counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs, network economies, process power, branding, and cornered resource. David, I am pretty sure I could make a case somewhere between 1975 and 1995 at Microsoft for all seven of these.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: It's one of the most defensible businesses they built in history, so of course they would have all seven of the powers.\\n\\nDavid: All right, let's run through each of them and do a quick 45 seconds on each.\\n\\nBen: Great. Counter positioning. I think the biggest example of this comes through where Microsoft is basically willing to jump on the microcomputer revolution before the incumbents were. IBM did not want microcomputers to happen. When they started to happen, IBM tried to figure out how to slow it down and reintegrate it into their old business model.\\n\\nMicrosoft basically had no baggage. This is classic innovator’s dilemma stuff. They could say, well, we don't need to make any money on hardware. We don't need to even make hardware. We are free to become the whole point of integration for the entire ecosystem just by shipping bits. And that is crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Actually, related to that—I can't believe we haven't talked about this in the episode until now—Microsoft could enable other companies to be successful. You talk to Microsoft people, they always talk about themselves as a platform, like we're a platform. Other companies grow on the back of Microsoft. That was not true for IBM. Totally not true.\\n\\nMicrosoft could make Compaq successful. Microsoft could make Lotus successful. Microsoft could make Intuit successful. Microsoft could make Netscape successful.\\n\\nBen: We keep talking about Microsoft as the point of integration, choke point, dependency, or standard for the whole ecosystem. Given that, it is quite remarkable how much value they created on top of the platform versus just captured for themselves. There's that famous Bill Gates line, you want your ecosystem around you to be generating more revenue than you are taking for yourself. They did a ton of that. It's the OEMs, and it's the application developers.\\n\\nDavid: That's major counter positioning. Okay, that's one.\\n\\nBen: Scale economies.\\n\\nDavid: That's everything we just talked about in Playbook.\\n\\nBen: It's unbelievable. When Microsoft has an install base of 100 million people using Excel—in this episode, let's just say 10 million people who are using Excel—and suddenly some up and coming spreadsheet comes out with a cool feature like auto sum, fill down, draw borders around the cells, or whatever, suddenly, Microsoft does a tiny bit of dev work. They can reap tons and tons and tons of value for doing that that the tiny company cannot do.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, great.\\n\\nBen: Fixed amount of dev work amortized across a large customer base.\\n\\nDavid: I don't think we need to say any more on this. The whole episode's about scale economies.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Switching costs. The funny thing about monopoly is there's nothing to switch to.\\n\\nDavid: That's a good one. This one's pretty related to network economies for me with this one of, okay, sure, you can switch to another operating system. Good luck getting other applications that you know and love to run on that.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, that's the answer.\\n\\nDavid: Speaking of network economies, developers, applications, OEMs.\\n\\nBen: There's not a classic network, Facebook, or AT&T style network here, in terms of one user can contact every other user, but more users being on Windows incentivizes more developers to make great applications for Windows, which enables Microsoft to sell more copies to more users, et cetera.\\n\\nDavid: Although, actually, I think once they start getting into the enterprise workplaces in general, organizations in general, there is the user network effect, like I want this Microsoft Word document that I just worked on for you to be able to open it and use it too.\\n\\nBen: You're right. I didn't even think about that. The document formats are a huge network effect thing, even before the Internet. Even before organizations were networked and computers were networked outside of an organization, file formats. You're right, there are huge network economies to file formats.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and it's inter-organizational too. If I'm a law firm, I want my clients to be able to open my Word docs.\\n\\nBen: Right.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, next.\\n\\nBen: Process power. This might be the weakest.\\n\\nDavid: As it so often is.\\n\\nBen: It's elusive. This is a little bit later in history, but I did always think it was absolutely incredible when I was at Microsoft, and we would ship a version of Office every three years. I worked on Office 15. The entire 6000 person organization had a process in place, where we could release to manufacturing (RTM) on a date that we planned three years in advance and actually hit it.\\n\\nThe process of the ads cuts meetings, the zero bug bounce, the testing schedule, and the triage when you had things that people wanted to introduce late in the schedule. It was a remarkable product, especially with all these teams that needed all their code to interoperate.\\n\\nI worked on a shared experiences team that would check things and that would be a dependency. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, all of them took on the shared code. We knew our ship date three years in advance and would hit it. It's crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. This exists. Especially by the time you get to the Windows 95 era at the end of this episode, it's like RenTech. The amount of stuff and process within Microsoft, the device drivers, the middleware, the programming languages, the dev tools, the machine there to make all this computing work, there was a miracle that this stuff worked. You couldn't just recreate that.\\n\\nBen: It's funny. The process power, I would say, is stronger in Office than Windows. Now my colors are showing. Windows always notoriously miss their ship dates. I'm actually less sure that process power existed in that early days. I think they were a bunch of smart people, but I'm not sure that they had a unique way of creating software.\\n\\nDavid: I think that got built over time.\\n\\nBen: Agree.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, branding, for sure.\\n\\nBen: For sure.\\n\\nDavid: Don't get fired for buying Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: That's true. Windows 95 built a consumer brand. The idea of a consumer brand of operating systems was there was Apple, but they were tiny, and that was more around the hardware.\\n\\nDavid: It's both fronts. It's their brand in the enterprise that is an amazing story that they built. They were branding consumer. The easiest to point to instantiation is the Rolling Stones and Jay Leno, but they had a software brand. Nobody had that.\\n\\nBen: But branding is probably the thing that they rely on the least interestingly enough. There are other structural reasons that they're entrenched, where even if Microsoft had a crappy brand in this era, they probably still would have won. The magic of getting the whole deal with the IBM PC and then getting to sell licenses to all the other OEMs.\\n\\nDavid: That brings us to the last one, which I think is a super strong one at least in this era, cornered resource. DOS, full stop.\\n\\nBen: Yup. It didn't start as a cornered resource, but as soon as IBM started shipping it on the IBM PCs, it was over. I'll say it again, IBM's distribution created demand for DOS, and then Microsoft just got to capture value from everyone else who wanted it.\\n\\nAll right, we would do bear and bull, listeners, but we know what happened after this. The bull case is that the party continues, and Microsoft continues shipping amazing operating systems after amazing operating systems. That stays the important thing in the world. The bear case is something else becomes an important thing in the world. Just having this super locked-in operating system is not actually the way to bet your whole company for the future.\\n\\nDavid: The dramatic tension for you all to come back for our next episode on Microsoft here is not because you want to find out what happens.\\n\\nBen: That's true.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, take away, splinter. We've spent the last probably six weeks deep in this. We've talked to everybody. What are you thinking about in the middle of the night?\\n\\nBen: The IBM deal. I can't unsee it. Microsoft figured out a way to take someone else's dominance and wholesale transfer that into their dominance for the next generation. The fact that IBM called the Project Chess is so deeply ironic because Bill Gates was playing chess and they played checkers.\\n\\nDavid: Maybe Bill was playing 3D chess. This is the thing about it, though. We got to give IBM so much credit for Project Chess and the PC, that they even did what they did was huge, that a big entrenched corporation that could ship a skunkworks project in a year, revolutionized the industry. They just didn't end up capturing any value out of it.\\n\\nBen: If I could make a less cheeky comment on it, I would say it's that a new technology generation, when something becomes possible and opens up a new market, it enables a shift in the point of integration and a value chain.\\n\\nThe old value chain of IBM, if you shipped the mainframe, you had all the power. But in this new world of PCs, if you controlled the operating system that all the users were familiar with and all the developers wanted to target, you had all the power. I think that is not necessarily obvious unless you went through it and have the hindsight of history to be able to articulate it.\\n\\nDavid: I think you might be right. I think this might be the single best business deal negotiation of all time.\\n\\nBen: It arguably created $3 trillion of value.\\n\\nDavid: No, a lot more than that because this is the point about Microsoft being a platform. Microsoft is worth $3 trillion, but how much value has been created on top of Microsoft? No matter what you think, good, bad, or ugly of Microsoft, you can't deny that.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely.\\n\\nDavid: At least twice as much, probably much, much more.\\n\\nBen: You watch every early interview with Bill, and you read a lot of his writing, he's a great writer. It's awesome that so many of his memos leaked whether intentionally or unintentionally over time.\\n\\nDavid: So many of his memos were issued for publication.\\n\\nBen: He really did view himself as a steward of the software ecosystem, and had this steadfast belief that software was magic and was going to change the world. Over the next 20 years, from 1975 to 1995, software did change the world, and Microsoft enabled it to happen.\\n\\nAgain, good, bad, or ugly, whatever you think of the company, they were sincere. I think the ugly part is, a lot of people want to hate on the value capture, because god did they capture value, but they were sincere in their desire and ability to create too.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. That's super related to my takeaway here. The moment for me in the research and then when we're telling the story along the way is when they start to believe in themselves that they don't need IBM. Just the audacity, and I mean that in a pure good way of these kids. These kids changed the world. That's so trite to say.\\n\\nMy book we read my daughter at bedtime and somebody gave us, it's like the most Silicon Valley trophy thing ever. It's like, what do you do with an idea? The punchline at the end of it is you change the world. It's become such a trope, but these kids in the 70s did it. They believed in themselves in the beginning and then more and more and more over time.\\n\\nThere's just this moment that I think, where they started to really, truly believe that they were going to change the world. Again, good, bad and ugly come out of that. Mostly good, I think, but just the level of ambition and audacity of these people is staggering.\\n\\nBen: Is that your splinter in your mind?\\n\\nDavid: That's my splinter, yeah.\\n\\nBen: Listeners who are new to the show, we've been iterating on how we end episodes. We decided on this recently of, how should we land the plane? It's to talk about the thing that we can't stop thinking about.\\n\\nDavid: This company's 49 years old, and it's still the most valuable company in the world.\\n\\nBen: Crazy. All right, David, I have some trivia for you.\\n\\nDavid: I love it. Trivia before carve outs.\\n\\nBen: Do you know where Dave Marquardt from TVI first encountered Bill Gates?\\n\\nDavid: No, I just assumed it was through Steve.\\n\\nBen: Dave had watched Bill present many years earlier at none other than the Homebrew Computer Club at Stanford, the very place that is part of the Apple lore with Jobs and Woz showing off the early Apple computer. Apparently, Bill also went and made a presentation there and would hang out there, and that is where Dave first came across him.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing. When we were talking about the letter that Bill writes to the hobbyist community decrying piracy and software, he's basically writing it to the Homebrew Computer Club. He believed that those were the people who were ripping off his software.\\n\\nBen: It's amazing. All right, carveouts?\\n\\nDavid: All right, carveouts. For new listeners, at the end of every episode, Ben and I just chat about one or two things that we've been enjoying personally lately that usually have nothing to do with the episode.\\n\\nIn my case, I have two. The first one has a lot to do with the episode. I have discovered/rediscovered the LGR YouTube channel. Are you into this Ben?\\n\\nBen: No.\\n\\nDavid: Clint and LGR, and it stands for Lazy Game Reviews, which I think is how it started, but then it became so much more, and now it's just LGR. Clint is this awesome dude, and I think he lives in North Carolina. He is dedicated to basking in the glory, restoring, reliving, and preserving computer history, hardware and software from this era. The YouTube channel is all unboxing a Compaq PC from 1992 or restoring a Windows 3.1 machine.\\n\\nBen: That's awesome.\\n\\nDavid: It's so good. He's got the best, most soothing voice in the world. He just seems like such a nice dude. He's dedicated to preserving the era of computing that we are talking about on this episode. It's so fun.\\n\\nBen: That's cool. It's really hard because all hardware fails eventually. At some point, there will be zero computers out there that can run Windows 3.1 that will boot. The only way to experience any of these things is through an emulator. I don't know. To be able to capture high-res footage and stuff of those machines while they still work, it's cool.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, super cool. My other carve out is Andre 3000 from Outkast. Do you know what Andre 3000 is up to these days?\\n\\nBen: Not at all. No.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, my God. Okay. GQ just did a big interview with Andre 3000 because he just released a new album. This is not what you think. Andre, a lot of people say, consensus top five rappers of all time. Big Boi, his counterpart in Outkast, also great too, but they basically went out on top.\\n\\nThey did Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which was their double album. I think it came out 2004 maybe. I was a freshman in college.\\n\\nBen: Hey Ya was on that, right?\\n\\nDavid: Hey Ya, yeah, everything was on that. They did one more album, and then they stopped. Andre would be featured on some other rappers tracks over the years, but didn't put out another album for close to 20 years. He just put out an album, and he just did this big video interview with GQ.\\n\\nThe album is a flute album. He got really into woodwind instruments. This has been his life. He reveals in the interview that he has put out other songs and other albums over the years under pseudonyms. This interview is so great. It's so unexpected because the interviewer keeps asking, you're Andre 3000, why'd you stop rapping? I don't have anything to say. Am I going to rap about getting a colonoscopy? This is where my life is right now. I never wanted to put out any work that wasn't both authentic and great. I didn't have anything to say anymore.\\n\\nBen: Yup, I love that. If you ever heard the phrase, go out when the top row at the back of the auditorium is empty?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and that's what they did. Idlewild which was the album that came out after Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, was great, but it wasn't that, and yet that's exactly what he did.\\n\\nBen: I think it's a Seinfeld quote. I might misattribute it. Drop a note in the Slack if I did, but I think it's a Seinfeld quote. \\\"You let one row be empty, but you don't want to wait too long.\\\"\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, it's the same thing as what Seinfeld did.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: Super fun. We'll link to it in the show notes.\\n\\nBen: All right. I have three and they're all different. We've had a tradition on the recent episodes of doing multiple carveouts, and all of them are different genres. My product that I've really been loving, my physical product is the Meta Ray-Bans.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. I was talking with the team at Meta about them. They're doing great.\\n\\nBen: I bet. It's a pretty delightful product. I bought them because I was in Hawaii and with my four month old son. We were in the pool and stuff. My iPhone's waterproof, but I want a different angle, and I don't necessarily want to be holding my phone. It's very cool to be able to take pictures and record video of what I actually see to be able to relive that moment.\\n\\nI did a bunch of photos and video. We were on vacation that way, and then I discovered a thing that they're actually just awesome for. I think even better than AirPods is phone calls. The speakers are great. I wouldn't say necessarily they're the best for listening to music. The bass is obviously not as good as headphone bass. They project the sound down toward your ears. Unless you're standing really close to me, you can't really hear, or unless I have the volume all the way up.\\n\\nThe microphones are great too. I was on a long walk on the beach with the wind whipping by on a call with my mom. I was like, does this sound really bad and distorted to you? She's like, not at all. I was really impressed and we'll definitely be using them for more calls. I think that style of headphone over the ear, there are many things that it's not good for.\\n\\nWhen you're on an airplane or something, you want to plug your ears, or if you're in a super loud environment. But unless you're in one of those environments, it's a nice break for your ears versus having AirPods jammed in. It's a great call experience. So they're great.\\n\\nThe battery's great. It's a four-hour battery, so it's a low key, more subtle, augmented reality experience. There's no heads up display. You don't see anything, but when you get a text message, it'll read it to you.\\n\\nDavid: There's more than just the camera system.\\n\\nBen: Totally. It basically is you have AirPods in, but you don't actually have AirPods in, and you have a pretty good photo video camera on your face.\\n\\nDavid: Does it have an indication when you're taking photo or recording video?\\n\\nBen: Yes. It's not super bright. I'm not sure everybody really knows when you are, but if you know what to look for, you know if it's on or off.\\n\\nDavid: Cool.\\n\\nBen: I've been loving it. I think it's a great product. I intend to wear them a lot this summer.\\n\\nMy second one is a thank you to a very, very good designer, Julia Rundberg, who worked with David and I on a recent project for some design work, some of which is actually featured as we speak on Apple podcasts. She did a bunch of other stuff with us, too, and she's really excellent.\\n\\nIf you're looking for someone who's good at visual identity, branding, slide decks, websites, I've worked with her on a few projects before and she's just awesome, so I wanted to recommend her.\\n\\nMy third is this community spotlight to go all the way back to nine years ago Acquired. It was a listener who runs a company called Summer Health reached out and said, I heard you say that you have a baby. I've got this great company that is for new parents, and here's some info on it. I am now a paying member. It is an on-demand texting relationship with a pediatrician.\\n\\nDavid: Wow. This is crack for new parents.\\n\\nBen: It is crack for parents. It's crazy. You can hook up multiple phones, so my wife and I both have a direct line to like, something weird is going on, will you help me through it? We had a 2:00 AM wake up the other night. Everything ended up being fine, but as I'm sure any other new parents can relate to, you really want to make sure in the middle of the night, if you're not sure if everything's fine, you would like to figure out the right steps to make sure everything's fine. Having a virtual doctor on demand is totally amazing. Summer Health, if you are a new parent, we've been loving it.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing. I'm going to have to subscribe. We've referred to this before. I think this will probably be the last episode that comes out while I'm still the parent of just one child. Number two coming soon. If it may take a little longer than usual for the next Microsoft episode to come out, our next six-hour opus on Microsoft, don't get too mad, that is the reason why.\\n\\nBen: We have a lot of thank yous on this one, as you can imagine. People were really generous with their time, pointing us to different resources, explaining their recollection of history as it happened. Being in Seattle, active in the venture community here, both through PSL and David, you're in my shared history at Madrona, me working at Microsoft, a lot of good opportunities to learn what really happened from folks.\\n\\nA huge thank you to Mike Slade who spent the time with me. Mike spent two different stints at Microsoft and then at NeXT, and Apple in between.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, he worked for Steve at NeXT, right?\\n\\nBen: Yup. One of the few people in the world who both spent a ton of time with Steve, Bill, and worked closely with both of them. It's so great to get his perspective, especially about the early days of Office and the applications group. Very helpful. Similarly, Pete Higgins worked closely with Mike. Pete, I think, ran Excel for a long time and oversaw a lot of the different stuff in the applications group, and I believe also ran Office.\\n\\nIt's funny how many different people picked up the mantle over time as these things traded around groups. But frankly, I think that's a huge part of the Microsoft story. The company very quickly adapted and changed its structure depending on the current needs of technology, competitors, and et cetera.\\n\\nHuge thanks to Tren Griffin, who is actually a lifelong Seattleite and close friend to the whole Gates family. Bill Gates Sr. was his mentor. I'm sure you've seen Tren's prolific tweets online about Microsoft history. Actually, Tren I think currently works at Microsoft in a strategy role. Thanks Tren for your help as well. David, I know you've got a bunch.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Also, speaking of former Microsoft folks who are very active and prolific on Twitter, we talked to Steven Sinofsky who had lots and lots of great perspective, and we can't wait to share more of it on the next episode.\\n\\nBen: I read 20 of Steven's Hardcore Software posts. When David and I were dividing up what belongs in what episode, I realized 19 of them belong in next episode. Steven, thank you for your early prep work for part two.\\n\\nDavid: So much fun internet stuff to talk with that Steven was right there for. I spoke with other people who ran windows, Terry Myerson who's a great friend and a supporter of the show. Terry ran Windows for quite a long time, right?\\n\\nBen: Yeah. When I was there, Terry was EVP over Windows and Windows Phone.\\n\\nDavid: Terry was very generous. He was actually the first person that clued us into just how key Steve's role was in building the enterprise for Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: And how different the go to market motions were for Windows and Office. I think Terry was the one that gave us the insight of Windows, especially in the early days. It was basically an OEM game, small group doing an OEM thing.\\n\\nDavid: There were 10 people selling that.\\n\\nBen: And it's still I don't think a very big team even today.\\n\\nDavid: Speaking of strategy, Charles Fitzgerald, who's OG in Microsoft and a great platform strategy guy, prolific angel investor in Seattle now, it's fun chatting with him about the early days.\\n\\nBen: Obviously, Brad Silverberg who we mentioned a bunch. It was very fun seeing after spending some time talking with Brad and texting a lot with him to see the end of the Windows 95 announcement after Bill and Jay Leno are done for Brad to come out and finish it off. It's fun. It's like watching a time machine, watching that thing is really cool.\\n\\nSoma Somasegar at Madrona is someone that David and I love crossing paths with in the Seattle entrepreneurship ecosystem.\\n\\nDavid: Soma's just such a legend at Microsoft and in the industry too. There's so many people who Soma made their careers, plucked them out of school, saw something in them that maybe they didn't even see in themselves, and then they went on to be big executives or venture capitalists at Microsoft or elsewhere.\\n\\nBen: Lastly, huge thank you to Steve Ballmer. To be honest, it was a little bit surreal chatting and hearing about his experience over the whole thing. There's nobody including Bill Gates that bleeds Microsoft more than Steve Ballmer, and his just unabashed pure pride in what they built is infectious.\\n\\nDavid: Absolutely. It was so fun talking to Steve. He was so gracious with his time. It must have been just super special for you too. He was the CEO when you worked there.\\n\\nBen: Totally. To be frank, I had a very opposite strategy in mind, but I was a new hire out of college, individual contributor PM. It was still the Windows company then, and Steve was championing the Windows strategy, and I was a guy working on Office for iPad.\\n\\nWith that, our huge thank you to JP Morgan Payments, ServiceNow, and Pilot. You can click the link in the show notes to learn more about any of those great partners of Acquired.\\n\\nIf you like this episode, I was thinking of ones to recommend. It would be pretty funny to go listen to the forethought acquisition, given all of this context. It's a short episode when David and I were not good at this yet, and we did our very best. It is from our early days, and it covers overlapping source material.\\n\\nDavid: Forethought was the company that made PowerPoint, Microsoft acquired, the first major acquisition for the company.\\n\\nBen: If you are new to the show and looking for great recent episodes that we've done, I highly recommend the Visa one as discussed earlier in the Network of Networks idea, if you haven't heard that, or perhaps the Nintendo or NVIDIA episodes, all of which will be right up your alley if you liked this one.\\n\\nDavid: If you're not at all interested in technology or software, but have somehow managed to get through all these hours with us, give a listen to our LVMH and Hermes episodes. Even if you do love technology and software, which obviously you do if you're still here, there's so much to learn from that world.\\n\\nBen: If you want to know every time an episode drops, get hints at the next episode topic, and get episode corrections and follow up, you can sign up at acquired.fm/email. Come discuss this episode with everyone else who's chatting about it at acquired.fm/slack.\\n\\nIf you're looking for another episode, go check out our second show, ACQ2, where we will have actually some very awesome tech CEO guests coming out over the next month or so that are absolutely worth listening to, especially if you're interested in semiconductor and tech history. If you want some sweet Acquired merch, go to acquire.fm/store.\\n\\nWith that, listeners, we'll see you next time.\\n\\nDavid: We'll see you next time.\\n\\n\",\n",
      "    \"followups_and_corrections\": \"Follow-Ups and Corrections:\\n\\n• The first GUI actually pre-dates Xerox PARC! Doug Englebart's “Mother of All Demos” was at Stanford Research Institute in 1968, demoing the first mouse, graphical user interface, and more. Many of these team members did however go onto form the core group of researchers at Xerox PARC.\\n\\n• We said that Steve Ballmer became the development manager for Windows 1.0 after the former dev manager was fired. That is not the case — that person resigned unexpectedly.\\n\\n• We left out the story of the development of “Protect Mode” Windows, which was a secret skunkworks project driven by a brilliant engineer named David Weise and his boss, Phil Barrett. (And not authorized by management!) By accessing the Intel 386 processor’s “protect mode”, David was able to allow Windows apps to use the chip’s full 16MB of memory, instead of just the standard 1MB memory they otherwise would have had. This was absolutely essential to making Windows commercially and technically viable in the marketplace (and eventually led to it dominating OS/2, Mac, etc). (Thanks to Rob Glaser)\\n\\n• Windows 386 was a key bridge product that paved the way for Windows 3.0 and 3.1. Win386 leveraged one key feature of the 386 chip that wasn’t in the 286 – the ability to multitask multiple 8086 virtual machines, which allowed multiple DOS apps to stay active at the same time. This was a super valuable feature for several transitional years. (Thanks to Rob Glaser)\\n\\n• The competing OS from UCSD was actually called “UCSD p-System”, not Pascal. Pascal was and is a programming language that UCSD contributed heavily to. (Thanks to Brad Feld)\\n\\n• The DEC operating system originally written by Dave Cutler (and other DEC colleagues) was actually named VMS, not VAX. The whole machine/system was commonly called VAX. (Thanks also to Brad Feld)\\n\\n• The decision to have Excel be made for the Mac instead of the PC was a huge and very disruptive decision made by Bill personally. Excel (code named Odyssey at the time) was originally being developed for the PC. When Bill changed it, the team didn’t like it, and the head of the Odyssey team (Doug Klunder) decided to quit over that decision (but was persuaded to stay until Excel 1.0 shipped). (Thanks to Rob Glaser)\\n\\n• Bill Gates wasn’t the only key Microsoft person who donated to the University of Washington CSE department — Paul Allen also gave a huge amount, and the department today is actually named the “Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering”. The Ballmer family as also given large sums to the UW over the years.‍\\n\\n\"\n",

The company that put a computer on every desk and in every home. The company that invented the software business model. The company that so thoroughly and completely dominated every conceivable competitor that the United States government intervened and kneecapped it…  yet it’s STILL the most valuable company in the world today. This episode tells the story of Microsoft in its heyday, the PC Era. We cover its rise from a teenage dream to the most powerful business and technology force in history — the 20-year period from 1975 to 1995 that took Bill and Paul from the Lakeside high school computer room to launching Windows 95 alongside Jay Leno and the Rolling Stones. From BASIC to DOS, Windows, Office, Intel, IBM, Xerox PARC, Apple, Steve Jobs, Steve Ballmer… it’s all here, and it’s all amazing. Tune in and enjoy… Microsoft.‍\",\n",

How is it?\\n\\nBen: I really like it.\\n\\nDavid: Nice.\\n\\nBen: I think it is reductionist to call it country.\\n\\nDavid: I was appropriately enough listening to Start Me Up through the ages.\\n\\nBen: Of course you were. But I feel like a David Rosenthal move is that you might have been listening to Start Me Up whether we were doing Microsoft or not. That's a very squarely in your genre song.\\n\\nDavid: The Stones though, man, it's crazy. They're in their 70s–80s.\\n\\nBen: Amazing.\\n\\nDavid: Man, I hope we're in our 70s and 80s dancing on stage.\\n\\nBen: Season 126.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah.\\n\\nBen: All right, let's do it.\\n\\nDavid: Let's do it.\\n\\nBen: Welcome to season 14, episode 4 of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. I'm Ben Gilbert.\\n\\nDavid: I'm David Rosenthal.\\n\\nBen: And we are your hosts. We often remark that selling software is the best business model of all time. Today, finally, we tell the story of the company that created that business, Microsoft.\\n\\nDavid: Finally, we're 10 years into Acquired. We're finally doing it.\\n\\nBen: It's been daunting. We wanted to do it for a while, but it takes some chutzpah to tackle Microsoft.\\n\\nDavid: I'm so fired up. We're ready. It's time.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, Microsoft today is sprawling and massive. It is the world's most valuable company worth over $3 trillion. They have 49 years of history making software for consumers and enterprises, making hardware, gaming systems, gaming studios, Windows apps, iPad apps, Mac apps, operating systems, mobile operating systems, MP3 players, search engines, cloud computing, services on cloud computing, programming languages, development environments, and the list goes on. But it did not start out that way.\\n\\nToday, we will tell the story of the desktop software company. Before the enterprise, before IT, before the Internet, before being a trusted partner to governments around the free world, and really, before people even knew what to do with personal computers, this is the story of a bunch of ragtag geniuses in their 20s pushing what was possible. Welcome to Microsoft, the PC era.\\n\\nListeners, if you want to know every time an episode drops, you can get hints at the next topic and follow up. You can sign up at acquired.fm/email. Come talk about this episode with the community at acquired.fm/slack. If you want more from David and I, you should check out our second show, ACQ2, where we interview founders, investors, and experts often as a deeper dive into topics we cover on the main show. Before we dive in, we want to briefly thank our presenting sponsor, JP Morgan Payments.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, just how we say every company has a story, every company's story is powered by payments. JP Morgan Payments is a part of so many journeys from seed to IPO and beyond.\\n\\nBen: With that, this show is not investment advice. David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss and likely all of you if you hold any index funds, and the show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. David, where on earth do we start the Microsoft story?\\n\\nDavid: We're right down the middle on this one. We're going to start in 1955 in Seattle, Washington with the birth of Bill Gates III or Trey as he's known growing up. It's so confusing because his dad is the second, but he goes by Senior, and Bill is Junior/III/Trey. Bill is born in 1955 as the second of three children to Bill and Mary Gates. Bill Gates Sr. (his father), is from Bremerton, the Navy town just across the sound from Seattle, where he grows up in a family that owns and runs a furniture store there, a long way from the software king of the world here.\\n\\nBill Gates Sr./II, after high school, he joins the Army during World War II, serves during World War II, and then he goes, I presume on the GI Bill to the University of Washington, where he's the first member of his family to go to college. There he gets an undergrad and a law degree in four years, and then decides to stay in Seattle with his new family and become a practicing attorney.\\n\\nI say family because at the U-Dub, he meets and marries one Mary Maxwell. Mary, I don't know how to put it other than that she is a force. Mary's family had founded National City Bank, and her father was a senior executive at First Interstate Bank, which later became a big part of Wells Fargo. Mary, despite being the daughter of a successful business family in that day and age, was not cast aside like so many other daughters we've talked about on the show.\\n\\nBen: New York Times, Hermes, where it was passed to the son-in-law to continue to run the business. That was not the case with Mary Maxwell.\\n\\nDavid: No. After she graduates from the U-Dub, she becomes first the president of the Seattle Junior League. She starts joining nonprofit boards in Seattle as a very young woman. She joins the Seattle Symphony Board, the Chamber of Commerce, the Children's Hospital, the King County United Way. She's such a force on these boards that she starts getting asked by her fellow board members to join their company's boards too. The corporate boards were so impressed with her.\\n\\nFirst, she joins the board of First Interstate Bank, the bank that her family's a part of. Then she joins the board of Cairo Television in Seattle. She even ends up joining the Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Board.\\n\\nBen: That's right, part of the AT&T breakup.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Eventually, she joins the Board of Regents of the University of Washington and the entire national United Way board. She never works full-time in a corporate setting, but it is not an overstatement at all to say that Mary Gates became one of the most powerful business people in the Pacific Northwest, period.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely, and Bill Gates Sr. was the prominent attorney in the region, so it's quite the power couple.\\n\\nDavid: Ben, it's like you're reading my script here. Yes. We don't want to give Bill Sr. the short shrift here either. He becomes a superstar lawyer, and he becomes a co-founding partner of the firm Preston, Gates, and Ellis, which today, I didn't even realize until I dug in the research, that is K&L Gates today, one of the largest law firms in the world.\\n\\nAnother fun fact that you probably know about Bill Gates Sr., but we got to, this being Acquired, talk about. Do you know what corporate board he joined later in life?\\n\\nBen: I do not.\\n\\nDavid: Costco.\\n\\nBen: Of course, Bill Gates Sr., we should say too, basically galvanized the entrepreneurial community in Seattle. He started the tech alliance. He was a huge angel investor. He really did organize angel investors, people who want to put high risk capital to work into startups. His heart was there, obviously, through his law practice, long before Bill Gates III became the prodigy he became.\\n\\nDavid: Totally, and that's the point we want to land here. For young Bill, Trey growing up here, he is growing up in a pretty unique household. He would later talk about being 9 or 10 years old. Most nights at dinner at his house, there would be a CEO, a senator, a governor, or somebody who's just over for dinner, and Bill would sit there and absorb the business conversation. It's like the Hermes family, the Dumas family that we talked about in that episode. This whole thing makes me think of Paul, the main character in the Dune movies in the book. He's bred from birth to be this incredible business mind.\\n\\nBen: At age 13, with his best friend, who we will talk about very soon, he brought up the idea, I wonder what company I will be the CEO of when I grow up. What industry will I go after? What problems will I tackle? It wasn't a question of if, but which.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. It just turned out that He would be the CEO and founder of the biggest company in the biggest industry ever to exist. The other thing that we got to say about Bill growing up, he is insanely competitive. He did not and does not like to lose at anything. That is putting it mildly, whether it's sports, swimming, computers, school, or the classroom.\\n\\nThere's a quote in one of the books we read from a childhood friend of his who says, \\\"Everything Bill did, he did competitively and never simply to relax.\\\" I think this used to be more than today. There's this image of Bill Gates that he was a computer nerd, that he was this shy little skinny kid. The way he looks doesn't help this, but that is not the case at all. This guy had a competitive fire in him, I'm sure he still does like none other.\\n\\nBen: Both things can be true. He was the number one math student in the State of Washington. He was a nerdy kid, a brilliant kid, and also fiercely competitive. His childhood friend and co-founder of Microsoft, Paul Allen, would say about him, “You could tell three things about Bill Gates pretty quickly. He was really smart, he was really competitive, and he wanted to show you how smart he was. And he was really, really persistent.”\\n\\nDavid: That sounds about right. Famously, speaking of Paul and where Bill and Paul meet, when Bill is in seventh grade, his parents enroll him at the Lakeside School, which now I think is internationally famous because of Bill. It is a super rigorous college prep school, middle school, and high school. Bill ends up writing the scheduling software for class scheduling that he puts himself in the classes with all the girls. Funny.\\n\\nThis Bill, 13 years old, seventh grade, Lakeside, this is when it starts. Obviously, Microsoft doesn't start. But during that year, Bill is 13 years old, the Lakeside Mothers Club raises money to buy the school a teletype, connect it up, and rent computer time from a DEC PDP 10 that is located in downtown Seattle and owned by the branch office there of General Electric.\\n\\nProbably a bunch of you are like, I have no idea what any of those words mean, so we got to set some context. This is 1968, the Beatles, Vietnam, the Summer of Love. This is not the computer age.\\n\\nBen: 2001, A Space Odyssey had just come out.\\n\\nDavid: Nolan Bushnell has not founded Atari yet. Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore are only just leaving Fairchild Semiconductor to start Intel. Silicon Valley is still dominated by Lockheed. There is no such thing as a microprocessor.\\n\\nBen: The United States would land on the moon one year later.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. The way computing worked back then, it was basically still the ENIAC days. A computer meant two things. It either meant a massive room sized machine that had about the computing power of a calculator, or it meant a human. People talked about computers as humans. Have you ever seen the movie Hidden Figures about the black women who did the calculations?\\n\\nBen: Yes. Those women were the computers.\\n\\nDavid: They were called the computers, yes.\\n\\nBen: Because they would sit there and compute.\\n\\nDavid: This was a totally different era. The idea that a 13-year-old kid in this high school, this middle school would get access to share computer time, I can't imagine there are many other secondary schools in the country that were doing this.\\n\\nBen: This is a very early place to make the point. Microsoft is the result of tremendous intelligence, brilliant strategy, fierce competition, and an unbelievable amount of luck. Bill Gates was born in 1955, the same year as Steve Jobs, to come into adulthood just as the personal computer wave is starting.\\n\\nThe fact that he was at a middle school and had this much privilege, where he could get access to a PDP-10 at this point in his life to help him understand how important computers would become, there are dozens of people in America who are as well-situated as Bill is, and that might be overly generous.\\n\\nDavid: He and Paul got a sneak peek into the future there at Lakeside. It's funny, you said the personal computer era. We are so far away from the personal computer here. We got us at the stage. What is computing? I mentioned ENIAC and these room-sized things.\\n\\nComputers did not have screens. You didn't have cursors, you didn't have lights, you didn't have pixels. Everything was done on a teletype that looked like typewriters, and they were wired up remotely either in the same facility or what Lakeside is doing. You could be remote. It's almost the cloud today.\\n\\nBen: And it called over a phone line. That was the teletype.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Got wired over the phone line, hooked up to these mainframes. You typed commands into this teletype, and then the response came back over the phone line or over whatever cable from the mainframe. It got printed out on a spool of tape on the teletype. But this is power that normal 13-year-olds don't come anywhere near accessing.\\n\\nWhat is the computing market at this time? It is pretty much—we'll come back to the pretty much in a minute—100% dominated by IBM. IBM, Big Blue, Big Iron is what it was referred to, the products that they would produce, were the industry.\\n\\nBen: Ben Thompson has a fantastic quote on this. He has an article called, What is a Tech Company? And here's his comment. \\\"Fifty years ago, what is a tech company was an easy question to answer. IBM was the tech company, and everybody else was IBM's customers. That may be a slight exaggeration, but not by much. IBM built the hardware, at that time the System 360, They wrote the software, including the operating system and the application, and provided services including training, ongoing maintenance, and custom line of business software.”\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, System 360 was a line of solutions, I would say, offered by IBM. It consisted of the room-sized thing, the mainframe, the software, which was system 360, and the consulting and the implementation. You couldn't just call up UPS and forklift one of these things into a company and expect it to work. No, you got to operate this thing too.\\n\\nBen: Totally, it's like ASML machines. You don't just ship them off to TSMC and say, good luck making semiconductors. It's a full solution, full service thing. But an important thing that was also happening this year, 1968, was that IBM was undergoing some antitrust scrutiny over that huge bundle that I just told you about.\\n\\nDoesn't it smell antitrust? They do everything from the hardware to the software to the operating system, the service, the support. They are the whole market. They're starting to get concerned. Proactively, they unbundled hardware, software, and services. They started selling those separately for the first time, which was not a problem at first. What it did was it cracked the door for customers to say, oh, I can buy hardware from IBM and software from someone else? Other people were not exploiting this, but it was possible.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, interesting. It cracks the door for Microsoft 15–20 years later.\\n\\nBen: Yes, but this is where the seeds are sown of what is the exploitable opportunity when Bill Gates is ready to do something.\\n\\nDavid: Interesting. Back to the timing thing for Bill, Paul, and Microsoft. I mentioned when we were setting this up that there's something else to talk about here. IBM was facing a disruptive force at this moment, I think, probably for the first time in its history, certainly in the computing era of IBM's history, and that was the Digital Equipment Corporation or DEC. Noticed when we said earlier that Lakeside is renting computer time from the General Electric computer in downtown Seattle, I said it's a deck PDP-10. It's not an IBM product.\\n\\nWhat's DEC? They're the \\\"mini\\\" computer company. Mini meaning it was the size of a closet, not the size of a room. It's all relative. DEC had been started by this guy, Ken Olson from MIT.\\n\\nWhat they did, he had this brilliant insight that would play out over and over and over again in technology that I'm not going to go compete with IBM head on, I'm not going to make any act. I'm not going to make mainframes.\\n\\nBut computing has advanced enough that there's an opportunity to make something smaller, less powerful, more toy-like, and there's enough demand out there that I think they can find some new markets for people who will buy those types of computers and it’s smaller businesses. But in particular, it's branch offices of the big company.\\n\\nI am sure General Electric bought lots and lots and lots of IBM mainframes and products at their headquarters, but the GE field office in Seattle is not going to truck in a mainframe.\\n\\nBen: And in 1968, Seattle is a provincial little town. I'm standing here right now. It's a major city and a huge economy in the United States. But at the time, a podunk, forgotten, sleepy, faraway place.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Microsoft would go a long way to changing that over time.\\n\\nBen: We should say this is the classic low-end disruption playbook. This is what Clayton Christensen was talking about. Going from mainframe to mini computers, I'm going to make something that's worse for most things, but better for some new things that new customers and new markets are going to care a lot about. IBM's going to look at it and go, that can't do any of the things that are important to our customers. And that's exactly why it works.\\n\\nDavid: Specifically, why are they not going to care about it? I don't know exactly what an IBM mainframe system, System 360, 370, whatever cost. I'm imagining tens of millions of dollars all in total cost, maybe hundreds of millions of total dollars to run a system like that and buy it.\\n\\nThe first DEC machine, when it comes out, the PDP-1, a few years before this time, was priced at $120,000, so an order of magnitude, maybe two below a system that you would buy from IBM. Obviously still a long, long, long way from the personal computer. People are not buying these things for their houses, but GE will buy one for the field office in Seattle, or universities will buy them for research, for their students, for their professors.\\n\\nDEC creates a new market for computing. Bill, he's so studied in business history, the founder, Ken Olson is Bill's hero. He totally looks up to DEC and what DEC's done. The DEC and minicomputer UI is still the same as the mainframe. You're still using a teletype. There's no innovation in terms of what computing is or how you use it. It's just cheaper and more people have access to it.\\n\\nBack to Lakeside and the Mother's Club raising money for this access here for the school, Bill, remember, he's just started. He's in seventh grade, and Lakeside is a middle school in a high school. The high school is actually in a separate building. The computer room that gets installed with the teletypes was over in the high school, but Bill doesn't care. He gets exposed to it in a math class one day and he's like, oh, I'm hooked.\\n\\nHe goes over. He's hanging out with the high schoolers, teaches himself how to program, and pretty quickly he becomes known as one of the very best programmers there. He and three other kids form what they call themselves the Lakeside Programmers Group. One of his buddies who he forms it with is of course the high schooler or I think the 10th grader at the time, Paul Allen.\\n\\nBen: There is a fantastic photo, listeners, that we will tweet of Bill and Paul sitting in the computer room at Lakeside. Bill, I think he's 13–14. He looks like he's about eight. I think on the wall, there's this almost printed out magazine thing that says the bug slayer that they've hung up over the wall. It's amazing.\\n\\nDavid: These high school kids, they start the Lakeside Programmers Group. They call it the programmers group because they are programmers. This is another super important thing to learn. To use a computer at this time meant to be a programmer. There was no package software that you bought. The software that IBM was selling was the operating system to make the machines actually function, and it was the programming languages that you could then program on but you weren't clicking around and using Excel or pulling up apps. Everybody who used a computer wrote their own software.\\n\\nBen: Right. There was not this multi-sided network of you've got developers making applications, and then you've got users of those applications. No, everybody who used a computer was a programmer.\\n\\nDavid: The goal of the Lakeside Programmers Group, remember Bill is this business prodigy, is to use their very valuable and very rare skills as programmers at this time to make money, do a business.\\n\\nIt turns out at the same time—the coincidences here are just crazy—there is a local startup coming out of the University of Washington called the Computer Center Corporation or C-Cubed. The business plan behind C-Cubed was that they were going to get a bunch of DECs, a bunch of PDP-8s, PDP-10s, PDP-11s, whatever, and they were going to be AWS. They were going to just be a computer time-sharing company.\\n\\nC-Cubed hires the Lakeside Programmers Group, these kids, to come in and find and document bugs in the system. They're going to pay them directly in computer time. When they come into C-Cubed, they learn Fortran, they learn Lisp, they learn machine language for the PDPs. Back at Lakeside, they were just using BASIC, the programming language.\\n\\nBen: Which is reasonably high level in terms of how abstract it is. You're not writing machine language. You don't have to know how to address memory, registers, and all that. It reads English, it knows how to add numbers together. It's not an elegant language, and it's a very verbose language. But if you look at it with your eyes as a person who speaks English and knows basic math, you're like, I understand what this program does. There's a meaningful amount of translation done by a BASIC interpreter that takes you from the BASIC code you have to write to what is actually running on the machine.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, but BASIC, we don't want to give the impression that it is just basic or just for kids.\\n\\nBen: No, it's widely used.\\n\\nDavid: It's going to become hugely, hugely important. It is both the gateway programming language for everybody, but it's a real programming language, and a lot of stuff is done in it.\\n\\nBen: It's the Python of its day. I think the way Python is now where you joke that Python is so flexible, you can accidentally write a program by writing English, it can forgive a lot of mistakes, and it reads English, it's a reasonable parallel to draw it way back when with BASIC where you say, look, you can understand it as a layman, but also it's used in a broad set of business applications.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. When Bill, Paul, and their buddies come into C-Cubed, they're now getting access to learn real hardcore systems programming languages, including machine code for the PDP-10. They're becoming pretty prolific engineers here.\\n\\nBen: They're handwriting assembly code.\\n\\nDavid: And they're getting mentored. One of the executives at C-Cubed is a guy named Steve Russell. Did you find this, Ben? Do you know about this?\\n\\nBen: No.\\n\\nDavid: This is amazing. You're going to die. Steve Russell was the guy who wrote Spacewar when he was at MIT on the first PDP, the PDP -1. He's a computer science legend.\\n\\nBen: Nolan Bushnell told us about that.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Spacewar was the first video game, first computer game ever written. It was written as a fun side project by some MIT engineers in the early days of DEC, and then that became Nolan Bushnell's inspiration for starting Atari and Pong. Steve Russell, that guy, he mentored Bill Gates.\\n\\nBen: Wow, and he was here at the University of Washington?\\n\\nDavid: He had come out to the University of Washington, and then left and was part of one of the execs starting this company.\\n\\nBen: C-Cubed, wow. That's a mile from my house.\\n\\nDavid: Right? Crazy.\\n\\nBen: Wow.\\n\\nDavid: After a little while at C-Cubed, all of this real expertise that these kids are getting leads to another opportunity at another timeshare computing company based down in Portland. They ask the kids to write a real piece of software, to write a payroll billing program for all their clients that are using the timeshare system.\\n\\nBill now, who's the de facto leader of this group, negotiates a deal with the help of his dad, Bill Gates Sr. prolific corporate attorney in Seattle. Rather than just being paid hourly for their time, they're going to get a royalty on the revenue that their client makes off the software. I can't believe it. These kids are teenagers. They're figuring out the whole software business model here.\\n\\nThey end up making at least $10,000 from these royalties, which the average household income in the US at the time was below $10,000. These kids are rolling in money. The next year, Paul graduates from Lakeside and goes off to college at Washington State. He and Bill decide to team up on a new venture that they're going to do together called Traf-O-Data.\\n\\nBen: They've identified a market opportunity, and that opportunity is reducing traffic.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. The business plan is that municipalities count cars that go through intersections, use that to make decisions about how they're going to do city planning. Bill and Paul are like, we can take this new thing that's coming out of Intel, a microprocessor, which is promising to be a full computer on one chip. We can use that. We can build a machine that is going to be a computer, and it'll process and analyze that data, and then we can sell it to governments. Great, big market.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, are you sensing what's happening here? Mainframe, mini computer, microprocessor. We have to keep using smaller and smaller words to represent the fact that the computer is getting smaller and smaller here.\\n\\nDavid: It wasn't until we started doing research for this episode that I finally realized, oh, microcomputers, which is the original term for the personal computer for the PC. It was called microcomputers before PC caught on. They're called microcomputers because they're based on the microprocessor.\\n\\nBen: Yes, absolutely.\\n\\nDavid: It's not just that micro is smaller than mini.\\n\\nBen: It is funny that it stopped there. The computers that are sitting on all of our desks are microcomputers.\\n\\nDavid: Right. While they're waiting for the AD08, this new first microprocessor from Intel, to come out, or at least for them to get access to it, they want to get a head start on programming their traffic data machine and programming this microprocessor. Paul's like, I got this. I can find a way to make this happen.\\n\\nHe takes the PDP-10 at Washington State and he writes a whole emulator program to mimic the instruction set for the AD08 from the manual. They get a full emulator up and running, and they can code even without the microprocessor actually being there. It's just NVIDIA. When Jensen was like, no, we got to build an emulator and simulate this, and then we're going to ship it sight unseen, they're doing the same thing.\\n\\nBen: It's funny. In many ways, at this point in history, getting a manual was actually much more valuable than getting the processor itself because the processor would arrive. Unless there was documentation, you would have no idea how to interact with it to take advantage of its power.\\n\\nIf you had a manual, sure, you couldn't actually test the stuff you wrote for it on the hardware. But if you wrote an emulator on a bigger, more powerful computer that could mimic the computer that you're actually targeting, you could go years before actually ever running the software on the target device and just work off of what the manual says as long as the manual is correct and matches how it actually works.\\n\\nDavid: And this is going to become very important to Microsoft in just a second. Traffic data is not a huge success. I think I read a few places, they make about $20,000 in revenue from it. Again, great money for high school and college kids, but not world-changing stuff here. This is not what Bill aspires to for the company he's going to start.\\n\\nBill and Paul are getting experience with the microprocessor. Bill actually has the idea for Microsoft when they're working with it. He's like, oh, this is a computer, why don't I go off and write an interpreter for BASIC here, and we can sell the BASIC interpreter for the microprocessor and build a big business? The AD08 just wasn't powerful enough yet to do that.\\n\\nBen: But spoiler alert, that totally becomes Microsoft. The seeds of Microsoft are selling language interpreters for new processors, new hardware, new computers that enable you to write familiar programming languages on that new hardware.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Bill and Paul are not the only ones having this insight here, too. Another Seattle guy named Gary Kildall who they had intersected with, who they knew from C-Cubed and the University of Washington, had the same idea here. We're going to bring up Gary and his company, Digital Research, a little bit later.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, he cared a little bit less about programming languages and a little bit more about operating systems. That's how they diverged for the few years here.\\n\\nDavid: Bill and Paul absolutely see the vision for what this can grow into and become. Bill has a great quote. \\\"Paul and I had talked about the microprocessor, and it was really his insight that because of semiconductor improvements, things would just keep getting better. I said to him, oh, exponential phenomena are pretty rare, pretty dramatic. Are you serious about this? Because this means, in effect, that we can think of computing as free. It was a gross exaggeration, but it was probably the easiest way to understand what it means to cut costs like that. And Paul was quite convinced of it.\\\"\\n\\nBen: Is this in the Smithsonian interview?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, so good.\\n\\nBen: It's so good. This quote is incredible because basically, Paul Allen brings up Moore's Law to Bill Gates; they don't use that language there. But in 1971, that is what's happening. For Paul, this is just an observation of hey, there's an exponential thing happening here, it seems like it's going to keep happening, it's been happening.\\n\\nBill's shaking and he's like, what? Exponential phenomena don't just happen. That's incredibly, incredibly rare and immediately gets Bill's wheels turning on. What does this mean for the world? If that's actually true, we need to act and do something profoundly different than anyone's ever done before because this enables new things that no one ever thought could be possible.\\n\\nDavid: This moment is the genesis of the vision for Microsoft. Even though Bill doesn't say the words in this quote, the vision of a computer on every desk in every home, that's the famous part that got left off later when the DOJ started sniffing around was running Microsoft software.\\n\\nBut that is the vision here, and it is crazy at the time. A computer on every desk and in every home, Bill sees that this is what this exponential phenomenon, what Moore's law means, that that is going to happen. We're still in the era of teletypes. Nobody else sees this.\\n\\nBen: And it's also the reason why Microsoft is going to form into such a different type of company that's ever come before it, why they can break all the rules, why they can sell just software, even though that's never been a thing before, why their business model can be so much different than everyone else's business model.\\n\\nIn preparing for this episode, we got to talk with Pete Higgins, who ran Excel and was an executive overseeing Office for a long time in the early days. He had this great quote to us, which was, \\\"Computer on every desk was wackadoo stuff. People laughed at it. It was absolutely wild. People thought, I don't know, maybe 1 in 10 people in their finance group or something will have one at some point. This is the profoundness of an exponential decrease in price or increase in power of computing. It's going to become universal.\\\"\\n\\nDavid: All that said, even Bill and Paul know the AD08. It's not there yet. It's not powerful enough to really be a general-purpose computer on a chip, but they know it's coming. In the fall of 1973, Bill goes off to college at Harvard famously. It's funny, at Harvard, like Jim Simons that we talked about at MIT on the RenTech episode. Bill thinks he's going to be a world-class mathematician and set the world on fire.\\n\\nBen: It's literally a quote from Paul Allen. Bill was the number one math student in the state of Washington. He gets there, and he does this theoretical math class, math 55 and gets a B. Paul says, when it came to higher mathematics, he might've been one in a hundred thousand or better, but there were people who were one in a million or one in 10 million. And some of them wound up at Harvard. Bill would never be the smartest guy in the room, and I think that hurt his motivation. He eventually switched his major to applied math.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. While Bill's at Harvard, he's also doing a bunch of the typical college kid stuff. He's playing poker, he's cutting classes, he's making friends. One of the friends he makes there is a kid down the hall from him named Steve Ballmer. Everybody knows Ballmer. He's everything that Bill is not. He's super social, he's super outgoing. He's in a final club, which is a big thing in the social scene at Harvard.\\n\\nBen: He's gregarious. Anyone who's ever met Steve or seen a video of Steve, you are well aware that this man has a presence. But the thing that people don't know about him is he is so unbelievably analytical. Steve is the guy that outscored Bill Gates on the Putnam exam.\\n\\nDavid: Which is the annual math competition for college students.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, Steve isn't a programmer, but he is every bit the mathematician that Bill Gates is. That is one of these things where I think when people try to set it up as well, you've got the brilliant programmer genius and the marketing guy, it's just like those are the roles they took. But I think when you're getting a sense of who the original crew was at Microsoft, they were all brainiacs, and they were all wildly analytical.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. In the spring of 1974, Bill's freshman year, Electronics Magazine publishes big news about a new Intel chip, the next generation, the next turn of the crank on Moore's Law, the 8080. In Bill's words here, all at once, we were looking at the heart of a real computer, and the price was under $200. We attacked the manual. I told Paul, DEC can't sell any more PDP-8s now. It seemed obvious to us that if a tiny chip could get so much more powerful, the end of big unwieldy machines was coming.\\n\\nBen: Yup. This is really where Bill Gates commits to computers to be his life's work. I think what's often lost in the story is Bill, even though he was good at computers and spent tons of time programming computers, never fancied himself a computer guy until this moment in history. He went to Harvard because he felt, hey, if I ever want to be a lawyer or something else, they've got a lot of great programs there. This was the moment where I think it really clicked for him that I'm just in the middle of the right place at the right time with the right skill set, and this is my way of having the most impact on the world.\\n\\nDavid: They think, okay, what's clearly going to happen here is all the big computer companies, IBM, DEC, the big Japanese computing companies, they see this. They're going to get into this business, they're going to make machines, and they're going to make microcomputers. Surely, they will jump on this opportunity, right?\\n\\nBen: If it didn't destroy their existing business model, sure they would.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Bill and Paul are sitting around waiting through 1974 and 1975 being like, hey, when are the 8080 computers going to come out? Where are they? It's just crickets. Paul is so convinced that the revolution is coming that he actually drops out of Washington State, moves to Boston to be close to Bill so that they can be ready when it happens. That summer, they both get summer jobs at Honeywell as programmers. Paul stays on into the next school year when Bill goes back to school. He's just waiting, waiting, waiting.\\n\\nIn December 1974, Paul is walking across Harvard Square, and he sees in a newsstand the January issue of Popular Electronics, on whose cover is the Altair 8800, the world's first real honest-to-God commercially available for sale microcomputer. The legend has it that Paul grabs the magazine, runs over to Bill's dorm, throws open the door, throws the magazine on the desk, and is like, it's here. Bill's just says, oh, my God, it's happening without us. We need to get on this right now.\\n\\nBen: It's so funny he thinks they're already behind because clearly they're not. History would show. I think Bill Gates even says, we might've actually started a year or two too early. The market actually hadn't materialized yet. The funniest thing is, the starting gun went off, Bill and Paul ran, and everyone else is still standing around.\\n\\nDavid: This is it. This is the moment. The revolution is here. Microsoft is about to be founded. But first, this is a great time to thank our presenting partner this season, JP Morgan Payments.\\n\\nBen: Just like Bill's vision of Microsoft to put a computer on every desk and in every home, JP Morgan has a vision for making payments real time, 24/7 everywhere and in every currency. JP Morgan has experienced a massive digital transformation, and is now much more than just a global bank. They invest $15 billion a year into technology and R&D. With JP Morgan Payments, you are getting their history of service, stability, and scale, but also innovation and new technology.\\n\\nDavid: Scale is really the key word here. Every episode, we talk about Hamilton Helmer's seven powers, and boy, does JP Morgan have scale economies. What's unique about their position in payments is that they can make massive infrastructure investments that benefit their customers in the near term, in addition to the long-term technology bets like blockchain or quantum computing. Since they move $10 trillion a day in 160 countries, these investments create a lot of shared value across their large customer base.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, not to mention the second of the Seven Powers' network economies.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. If you're a JP Morgan payments customer, whether you're a startup or a Fortune 500, you can access their payments partner network. This is a set of third party integrations across virtually every industry and payment use case. It makes it easy to discover what specific set of tools are best for your business.\\n\\nBen: It's basically a B2B marketplace that connects their clients with the broader payments and technology ecosystem such as treasury management systems, ERPs, point of sale hardware solutions, payment gateways, and so much more. Given JP Morgan's scale, you can imagine the value that comes with unlocking access to their industry leading partners and technology.\\n\\nDavid: Let's take Visa, for example, which listeners may remember. We talked a lot on that episode about the power of a network. Visa works with JP Morgan to provide global payment processing services. Now through the partner network, you can easily add Visa as an acceptance method through a streamlined implementation with consolidated reporting. Other companies in the partner network include Oracle, American Express, MasterCard, Accenture, and many more including friends of the show, Modern Treasury.\\n\\nBen: Across any industry, the most successful companies we've talked about are the ones who think and invest strategically through a long-term lens. Like Hermes, durability and reliability are paramount for building hundred year companies that can reinvent and continue to grow. That is the case for JP Morgan Payments. Their history of trusted solutions and investments in technology bring clients and new fintech companies together to drive innovation and growth for businesses of all sizes.\\n\\nDavid: Before we jump back into Bill and Microsoft, who essentially wrote the modern playbook on building platforms, be sure to check out jpmorgan.com/acquired or click on the link in the show notes.\\n\\nBen: David, they're like, it's happening without us. What do they do?\\n\\nDavid: They do the natural thing that two super excited, ambitious, high octane college kids would do. They call up the main phone number of Altair's manufacturer, a company called MITS and ask for the president, a man named Ed Roberts. Bill and Paul get them on the phone and they say, we have a BASIC interpreter, ready to go, ready to ship, for the 8080 Intel chip, and we want to provide it for you, for your machine.\\n\\nBen: Of course they don't.\\n\\nDavid: They don't have a single letter of code written. They don't have anything.\\n\\nBen: It's a market test. They want to know what's the response if this were true.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Ed's a bit of a character himself. He says, okay, well, guys, a lot of other people are calling me and saying the same thing. What I'm telling them, and I'm going to tell you too, is that anybody who can come here to my office in Albuquerque, New Mexico and demonstrate a working version of BASIC on my Altair will get a contract with us to distribute it when they go on sale. Bill and Paul say, okay, great, we'll see you soon, and hang up. By ‘see you soon,’ they mean, ‘let's go get to work.’\\n\\nBen: This is a big deal for MITS too if this works, because right now they've just announced a machine for which you can't really do anything on it. The hardware is powerful, but they're not going to have a lot of customers unless there's stuff you can do on the machine. A BASIC interpreter running on it, it's quite valuable to then make the claim you can program BASIC on our computer. They're very excited about this, even though they're playing coy.\\n\\nDavid: I was going to talk about this in a minute, but let's talk about what the Altair is. What did they just announce in the magazine here? The Altair is the first mass market commercially available personal computer.\\n\\nBen: Again, no screen or anything.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Does not have a screen, does not have a keyboard, doesn't have a display of any kind. What it does have is it has a set of 16 lights on the front of the machine, Christmas lights and 16 switches. You can flip the switches to flip bits, and then the machine will respond by lighting up different patterns of lights. It doesn't come with any software. There's nothing. That's all it is, 16 lights, 16 switches.\\n\\nBen: In order to use it, you got to hook up your own teletype, you got to get the manual, you got to hope that the manual is right, and you got to code to the machine instructions, literally the assembly language for the chip inside for the Intel 8080.\\n\\nDavid: Back to the Traf-O-Data days and Paul writing the emulator for the 8008 at Washington State, Paul's like, we got this. I'll just write an emulator on the Harvard PDP-10 for the 8080 instruction set.\\n\\nBen: He does the same thing again. They get the manual, they have an emulator, and they write it against an emulator.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Bill writes the BASIC interpreter. In a couple of weeks, they've got it working. Ed's like, okay, come on out to Albuquerque. Bill and Paul—remember, Bill still looks he's 12 at this point in time—decide that just Paul should go.\\n\\nBen: Does Paul have a rocking beard at this point yet?\\n\\nDavid: Paul is super 70s. He is into it. As we'll see, he's going to fit right in at Albuquerque and MITS. Paul gets on a plane, flies from Boston to Albuquerque. In a total epic legend moment, they didn't have a bootloader written for the BASIC interpreter.\\n\\nThey had the BASIC, it was all written, they'd done it on the emulator, and Paul's flying out with the computer tape with the code of the BASIC interpreter on it. He's like, oh, shoot, we can't just feed that right into the machine. There's got to be a bootloader to load up this thing. He writes the bootloader on the plane.\\n\\nBen: On paper, by hand, he is hand coding octal, not even assembly language instructions. He's hand coding in pure octal the instructions to load their BASIC interpreter program into memory.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. He lands in Albuquerque, drives out to MITS. They load the bootloader onto the prototype Altair there that loads up the BASIC interpreter, and it fails. It doesn't work. Paul's like, oh, shoot, let's try it again. Let's try it again. They try it again. This is how early computing is. It works the second. Who knows what the bug was the first time. They didn't change anything, it just didn't work the first time, and it worked the second time.\\n\\nIt loads up, Paul writes in the instructions, print two plus two. It spits out four—by spits out, I mean the lights light up and say four. Both he and Ed, their jaws are on the floor. Paul's like, oh, my God, the BASIC works. Ed's like, oh, my God, the Altair works. Neither of them believed this was actually going to work.\\n\\nBen: Ed actually has more eggs in this basket than he let on because when Bill and Paul call and say, hey, can you give us the teletype instructions, he reveals they're actually the only ones who called about that. Everyone else who said they were writing a BASIC never got far enough to ask, how do we actually interact with your computer?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Now is the time to say a few words about Ed and MITS. What is this company? Bill and Paul originally thought that it was going to be the IBMs, the DECs, the Japanese companies who are going to make the first microcomputers. MITS is about as far away from IBM as you can possibly imagine. MITS basically was a model rocket company.\\n\\nBen: Which, Albuquerque is a great place to do that.\\n\\nDavid: Ed Roberts, the founder, had been in the Air Force and stationed in Albuquerque. That's how he got involved in model rocketry. The reason that they're introducing the Altair and they made this big Splash in the magazine was this is a last ditch gambit to try and save the company. You got a bankrupt model rocketry company.\\n\\nBen: Their little gambit worked and got a couple of college kids to pounce.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Why did it work? They had two things going for them that really, Ed, I think probably personally made happen. (1) They got this splashy popular electronics magazine cover that was through a relationship that Ed had. (2) The sticker price was $397, which is about $2300 in 2024 dollars. Yes, that's a lot of money, but the next cheapest computer that anybody could buy at this point in time was a DEC, a $120,000 mini computer. The idea that somebody could buy a computer for $400, I don't care who's selling that thing, I want that.\\n\\nBen: What did they get, some sweet deal from Intel?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This is all Ed's doing. The list price from Intel for the 8080 chip was $360. I think this is part of what was deterring the market of how would anybody sell a kit that was affordably priced when so much of the cost of goods would go to Intel with the processor deal. He managed to negotiate a volume deal with Intel to get 8080 chips at $75 a pop. That was the key unlock.\\n\\nBen: That's a 5X price reduction.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I wasn't able to find how that negotiation went down or why Ed Roberts in Albuquerque, New Mexico got this sweetheart deal from Intel.\\n\\nBen: Either the list price is wildly wrong, or they were cutting deals all over the place. One thing it could have been is just that, and I'm totally speculating, but chips are the ultimate high fixed cost investment, low marginal costs next to software.\\n\\nYou could imagine maybe Intel had already put all the money into the fixed costs of spinning up the fabs and was expecting a certain amount of market demand, and they weren't seeing it. They were like, crap, we've got to recoup our investment. I don't know, lower the price, let them just sell. Maybe we'll make it up in volume.\\n\\nDavid: I like that. I have no idea, but that's a totally viable train of thought here. Either way, he gets the sweetheart deal. Not only does it make computer history and enable and create Microsoft, it saves the company of MITS.\\n\\nThey were on the edge of bankruptcy. After the popular electronics article comes out, they get 4000 pre-orders in the first month or two, which is $1.5 million in revenue, cash paid upfront. That is pure cash hitting the bank account.\\n\\nBen: That will save a company.\\n\\nDavid: And also just proves 4000 people just paid cash sight unseen for 16 lights and switches. There's a lot of demand for a home computer here.\\n\\nBen: At decent margins too, if they're getting the processor for $72, and they're selling it for what did you say?\\n\\nDavid: $397.\\n\\nBen: Everything else in there is much cheaper than the processor, so I don't know. Depending on how much they have to give to the sales channel they're selling through, if it's retail or distributors.\\n\\nDavid: I think they're selling direct. I think people are just sending money orders.\\n\\nBen: It's a decent margin business. Unlike what the PC business would become over time, they managed to have nice margins.\\n\\nDavid: Paul and Ed hit it off. Paul decides to move out to Albuquerque to be close to the action here. He actually joins MITS as their vice president of Software. He's vice president of a software department of one. He is the software department here.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, software department of one, but he's got his buddy Bill Gates who is not employed, but Bill's definitely working on software for the Altar as well.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Bill stays at Harvard, but keeps cranking on enhancing the BASIC interpreter and adding more functions and functionality to the version of BASIC that they had just written for the Altair. Once the school year is over, he comes out to Albuquerque for the summer.\\n\\nThe Altair is getting ready to ship with the Microsoft BASIC included in it. Bill and Paul need to set up a company, but Paul is an employee of MITS at this point, so what did they do? They set up a partnership. The founding of Microsoft, at this point Micro-Soft, is a two-person partnership between Bill and Paul.\\n\\nBen: As we record this, that was 49 years and one day ago. We are sitting here on April 5th recording. That was April 4th, 1975. It is very funny to look back at some of the original signatures when Bill writes on letters. It's Bill Gates, the general partner of Micro-Soft, which is great. I think it's actually a Paul Allen name where he wants to put together microcomputer and software. Bill's like, that's perfect, we're immediately just going to run with it. As it was a partnership, originally, they were going to call it something like Allen and Gates, and then they ultimately are like, no, Micro-Soft is perfect.\\n\\nDavid: Microsoft has become Kleenex. Microsoft means microprocessor software.\\n\\nBen: I will say it's a nice clarifying North Star because it really draws the line in the sand and says, we're in the software business. Gates makes this really clear to Paul Allen, who is often tempted to do hardware stuff. Bill is very hardcore about saying, no, what we're uniquely good at in the world is software and we should stick to that.\\n\\nI also suspect Bill is starting to realize that there's an amazing business model here if we can pull it off, where we don't have to make the hardware, and we can charge for every copy of the software sold. But that insight, I would say, has not yet fully materialized.\\n\\nDavid: Let's talk about business model here in one sec. First though on the partnership. Again, we've been saying all along that Bill is clearly the leader here. They set up the partnership. Initially, it's 60/40 ownership, Bill is 60%, Paul is 40%. Later, it gets changed to Bill is 64% and Paul is 36%. Yup, Bill is the leader here.\\n\\nBen: Bill's case that he makes on that to Paul is, hey, you took a job and you were doing this on the side, I was all in. Paul's an agreeable guy, and 36% is still a nice percent, so he says, sure.\\n\\nDavid: In the long run here, everybody gets nuts. It's all a rounding error, but to that point back to the business model. Once the partnership is set up, they sign an exclusive licensing arrangement with MITS. This is super important. This is a big lesson that young Bill and Paul are going to learn here.\\n\\nMITS gets exclusive license to the BASIC interpreter to the BASIC as they call it for the 8080. MITS is the one that can then decide whether to sublicense the BASIC out to other companies or not.\\n\\nEssentially, this is a distribution deal with MITS, where MITS becomes the exclusive seller and distributor of Microsoft's BASIC. Microsoft doesn't have any direct sales control here, and it's going to become a big, big, big issue. The terms of the deal are Microsoft is to get $30 for each copy of BASIC that MITS sells plus 50% of the revenue that comes from the sublicensing deals that MITS may or may not do with other companies who want to use the BASIC.\\n\\nBen: Why would they ever do any sublicensing deals? Why would you give it to your competitors?\\n\\nDavid: That is a really good question, Ben.\\n\\nBen: Let's just round that part of the revenue to zero.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. This is a big, big, big divergence of interest between Microsoft and MITS. The kicker on this contract is that the total amount of lifetime revenue that Microsoft can make from the BASIC from MITS is capped at $180,000. Ed admits really has the upper hand in this deal.\\n\\nBen: Or phrased another way, we will give you $180,000 for you to hand over exclusive rights to all that cool BASIC stuff you just wrote to us. But if we sell fewer than X machines, we're actually going to pay it out to you on a prorated basis at $30 a pop rather than giving you the full $180,000.\\n\\nDavid: That is another way to frame it. Definitely, a great deal for MITS. On the other hand, what are Bill and Paul going to do here?\\n\\nBen: Right, a great deal for them too given the position they're in.\\n\\nDavid: Right, MITS is the industry. There is one very, very important clause in the contract though, protecting Microsoft's interests. That clause is that MITS must use its best efforts to license, promote, and commercialize the BASIC broadly in the marketplace. Any failure to do so by MITS would be grounds for termination of the contract by Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: Thank God, Bill's dad is a lawyer.\\n\\nDavid: Indeed. The Altair comes out for sale later in 1975. Microsoft does $16,000 in revenue that year from their $30 a pop, the BASICs that are getting sold with the Altair, which is great, especially the first year that they're starting.\\n\\nThe next year in 1976, everybody's so excited about this new market, the vision that's happening, the demand, the Altair, the sales that Paul Allen resigns from MITS to join Microsoft full-time. Bill drops out of Harvard officially. He moves to Albuquerque. They're all in on this. But for the year in 1976, Microsoft's revenue is still only $22,000. It was $16,000 the year before, $22,000 in 1976.\\n\\nBen: Not a high growth company.\\n\\nDavid: This is less than they were making in high school. What is going on here? (1) MITS is the one at the controls of sales, not Microsoft. (2) MITS is selling a thousand computers a month. This is taking off. This is creating a new industry. Despite MITS selling thousands of computers a month, only a few hundred copies of BASIC are selling per month. What's going on? People are pirating the software. This is the discovery of software piracy.\\n\\nBen: This is a pretty interesting time to pause and say, are they pirating software?\\n\\nDavid: That's a good question.\\n\\nBen: This is 1975. Piracy implies that you are running afoul of some particular legal protection for the good. You might say, well, with today's legal frameworks in hindsight, you would say, of course, if they're copying the software and not paying the money for it, it's piracy. That was actually not established yet. This is the craziest thing. Bill basically has an opinion that it's piracy, and he writes letters to the computer community.\\n\\nDavid: He writes an open letter to hobbyists.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and tries to basically guilt trip people. He tries to use that as a recruiting method and say, if you're so excited about pirating our software, maybe you should just come work with us. Nothing would make me happier than making the best software in the world, and please join us on this mission. But ultimately, the legal standing that he has to say, hey, what you're doing is illegal, is not fully established.\\n\\nIt would actually take a couple of years for the courts to look at software and say, what about this is protectable? If you think about it, it is a little bit weird. You've got source code that looks like English, BASIC, it's letters and numbers. It gets translated to machine code. That machine code ends up running, and it's basically electrons. It's voltages that are flipped up and down. What about that are we trying to protect?\\n\\nUltimately, the way it gets litigated through some case law from court cases is that the source code is a copyrightable, creative work that is expressed through some tangible medium. That's the important thing about copyright law. It's a creative work expressed through a tangible medium. A book, the creative work is the words and the tangible medium is printed on paper.\\n\\nWith software, it actually took until 1980. Congress changed the law. We'll put a link in the show notes to the literal congressional change that happened. It is in Title 17, Copyrights Chapter 1, Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright. In 1980, they include a defined term, which is a \\\"computer program is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.” Once you have that passed by Congress codified into law, you now have the standing legal framework that all the whole computer industry used going forward, in particular, the software industry, a computer program is copyrightable work.\\n\\nDavid: Wow, I didn't know all, that's awesome.\\n\\nBen: It's totally crazy how recent that is. But when you think about it, why would that have any legal…? Software is such an abstract idea. Before, the whole business model of computers was good luck just replicating an IBM PC and everything that comes with it. You don't need any legal standing. But if you're going to pursue this software only business model, what's the protection around your abstract product?\\n\\nDavid: That's exactly what I was going to say here. This is the other element of what's going on. This is the first time software has ever been sold. Other than the IBM accounting machinations to protect themselves from antitrust, which was just accounting, nobody had ever sold software before. This is the first time.\\n\\nBen: Certainly to build a legitimate business around it. The other thing that's useful to know is when you're selling an IBM PC, you're literally selling a PC to a customer the same way that when I'm selling you this glass. From crate and barrel, I am selling you the glass, and the glass is now yours. I've transferred property to you.\\n\\nSoftware is not that, so the whole world of software is built on a license agreement. The source code that computer program the actual right of that is retained by the creator, and you license the copyright to your customer to be able to use that on their machine.\\n\\nThere's this dual idea that computer software is copyrightable, and you can grant a license under certain conditions for customers to use it. That is the legal framework for which the next 50 years of technology at large would operate under.\\n\\nDavid: For the moment though...\\n\\nBen: They have a piracy problem.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The law isn't going to change until 1980. Microsoft would be dead if they didn't figure out a solution to this before 1980. This is when Bill ultimately realizes, shoot, we did the wrong business deal with MITS here. MITS has to sell, and customers have to make the decision buy our BASIC. It's a key critical part of the value of the computer. It's the whole thing.\\n\\nBen: It makes that machine useful.\\n\\nDavid: Without it, it is not useful. It's totally setting up the wrong incentives and value equation that customers should be buying this themselves. It should be included by the hardware OEM in the machine that they are selling and in the total purchase price. If that happens, We no longer have a piracy problem because we're just getting paid as part of the purchase of the machine.\\n\\nBen: Right, it should be a royalty.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The problem is that is not the deal that they had with MITS.\\n\\nBen: Right, or framed differently. Instead of saying, hey, consumer, do you want to buy something else too and make a new purchase decision, they should be saying, hey computer manufacturer, we make your thing actually useful, so pay us for it.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. During 1975 and 1976, MITS pretty much had this new microcomputer market all to themselves. There were a couple of other competitors who sprung up, but nothing made. The Altair and MITS was the microcomputer company.\\n\\nAll that changes, though, in a big way in 1977, when what Byte Magazine calls the 1977 Trinity hits the market. That is three machines, the Tandy/RadioShack TRS-80, the Commodore Personal Electronic Transactor, or the acronym PET, and the Apple II. All three of which machines were like the Altair, low cost, mass market.\\n\\nUnlike the Altair, they were not kits. They were fully assembled, fully functional, right out of the box, and they each had their own major distribution advantages. In Bill's words, these three machines, the 1977 Trinity, ignite volume in the market. Bill loves these really dramatic verbs like we attacked the manual, they ignite the volume in the market.\\n\\nBen: The press just latches on to him. Whenever Bill has a leaked memo or something where he talks about all this war terminology, those all become headlines.\\n\\nDavid: It's so great. Earlier, during 1976, Microsoft had started getting approached by a few of the bigger computing companies NCR (National Cash Register), GE, Control Data Systems. I want to license Microsoft BASIC for the 8080 microprocessor here so that we can experiment with these things. Each of these deals would have been revenue to Microsoft of $100,000-ish.\\n\\nEd and MITS, they keep dragging their feet on negotiating these. They've got the exclusive license. Everything's got to go through MITS. Most of them are turning down because Ben, you said, they don't want anybody to come in and compete with them.\\n\\nBen: Yup, there's the misaligned incentive.\\n\\nDavid: There's the misaligned incentive. There is the clause that Bill and Microsoft, and I presume Bill Sr. put in the original agreement—is MITS is using its best efforts to commercialize the BASIC and gain adoption in the market? You can make a pretty strong argument that they're not.\\n\\nEd, though, unbeknownst to Bill and Paul, has another reason that he's dragging his feet on these deals, which is that he's about to sell the company. In May of 1977, MITS gets acquired by the tape drive manufacturer, Pertec, for $6.5 million. Ed rides off into the sunset.\\n\\nPertec knows about this dispute with Microsoft, and they come in and they figure, who is this Bill Gates? He's a 21-year-old kid, a college dropout, we're a big company, we can deal with this. Robert says an amazing quote later. He says, \\\"Pertec kept telling me they could deal with this kid. It was a little Roosevelt telling Churchill that he could deal with Stalin.\\\"\\n\\nBen: Oh, my God.\\n\\nDavid: I also don't think they realized that this kid's dad is one of the best corporate attorneys in the country.\\n\\nBen: Bill Gates was just constantly underestimated, which worked to his advantage in those early days.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: This is the thing about Microsoft. People forget how insanely young Bill was. He was just 20. To put that in context, he's only 7 years older than Jensen Huang, but they feel an entire generation apart since Microsoft was started almost 20 years before NVIDIA. When you start bending your mind around like, oh, Bill Gates is still pretty young, considering what an institution Microsoft has become in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Microsoft next year is going to have its 50th anniversary. I believe that'll also be the same year that Bill turns 70. That's wild.\\n\\nBen: Yeah.\\n\\nDavid: That fall in 1977. The dispute between MITS/Pertec and Microsoft goes to arbitration in Albuquerque. The interim months while this arbitration is happening are the only moment in Microsoft's history where cash gets tight. They're running out of money because they can't really make any sales here.\\n\\nBen: They don't control their destiny.\\n\\nDavid: People aren't paying MITS for the BASIC. They're \\\"pirating\\\" the software. They can't do deals with all the other computer companies that want to come licensed directly, so things get a little tight. Microsoft ends up winning the arbitration, I believe, in maybe November 1977, meaning they are now totally free to license BASIC to anybody who wants to buy it on any terms that they want.\\n\\nThey turn around. They immediately license it to Trinity, Apple, Commodore, Radio Shack, and Tandy. They license it to all the big companies, the GEs, the NCRs, who want to experiment with microcomputers.\\n\\nThere's a really funny story with Apple that apparently, Woz had more or less written 95% of their own BASIC. But it didn't have floating point numbers, it only had integer numbers. Jobs is totally writing Woz. He's like, the BASIC is really important. Can you just finish it? Can you do floating point? Woz just doesn't do it, so Jobs has to go license Microsoft's BASIC. Amazing.\\n\\nBen: That's the first deal that happens between the companies. There's so many deals done, both directions, commercial deals, equity deals, legal disputes in both directions. This is the very first time that they do something together.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Bill, Paul, and Microsoft, do all these deals. They do them all as cash upfront, fixed cost, all you companies, you're going to pay us. You include the BASIC in the machines that you're selling, and we're going to get all the money up front. Super presciently, though, Bill does not value maximize on these deals.\\n\\nThe Apple deal is $31,000 for eight years of access for Apple for the Apple II Microsoft's BASIC. They're not price gouging here because Bill sees, he's like, the play here is we want to make it a no brainer for everybody who's selling a microcomputer to have Microsoft's BASIC on it, because we want to set the standard.\\n\\nIf we are the standard programming environment that anybody who's using these computers—and again, anybody who is using these computers is programming them, they're used to the Microsoft version of BASIC—we're going to have so much power that it'll become a self-fulfilling prophecy. All of our competitors will just wither away. Nobody will want them because it's not going to be compatible with the language everybody knows. Once people start trading and then ultimately developing and selling software that they've written, it's only going to run on our BASIC interpreter, not anybody else's.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating. I actually didn't know that it started this early. One correction there, you don't know for a fact it's only going to run on Microsoft's BASIC interpreter, but you do know for a fact that it will run on Microsoft's BASIC interpreter. If it's cheap enough, why would you take the chance on a clone that might have one or two things wrong with it?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Basically, his vision is, I want to remove any oxygen from any argument anyone could have about not using Microsoft's BASIC on a microcomputer. He thinks about this concept as a positive spiral that he really in his mind is the reason for Microsoft's success.\\n\\nHe says, “Success reinforces success. In a growing market, one way of doing something gets a slight advantage over its competitors, this is most likely to happen with high technology products that can be made in great volume for a very little increase in cost.” If you get that slight advantage, it'll compound, and this is what he's playing for here.\\n\\nBen: It's interesting. In the earliest days, what was stopping someone else from writing a BASIC interpreter and licensing it to Apple or RadioShack? Nothing. There were other smart people out there. It was just a very good business decision to say, we got to close that door. We just got to make this a no-brainer for people to buy from us, because if we're value maximizing and it's starting to feel expensive, they're going to turn elsewhere until we get a lead.\\n\\nDavid: The Apple story is the perfect example. The Woz thing is cute, it makes for a good story, and oh, he didn't finish the BASIC. But when Microsoft sold them the BASIC, which was already getting established as the standard for $31,000...\\n\\nBen: Sure. Why not?\\n\\nDavid: No brainer. Apple could have gone out and hired another programmer to finish the BASIC. They're like, wait, we could do that, or I could just get the standard one for $31,000. I'm going to do that.\\n\\nBen: Just because it's important to establish there are trade offs for everything, if you're running a startup right now, you might think to yourself, oh, great. I'll just run that exact strategy. The important thing here is (a) Most of the work was already done for the original BASIC. (b) Bill was doing it himself, Bill and Paul, so the importance of technical co-founders. Their overhead was crazy low.\\n\\nThey could do these deals where they don't make very much money. I think at the end of 1977, there were five employees. Their overhead was just so unbelievably low that they could take a really long lens.\\n\\nDavid: Even though it takes until the very end of 1977 when the MITS dispute gets resolved and Microsoft can actually make money again, they end 1977 with $381,000 in revenue, despite zero for the first 11 months of the year. They're just rolling in cash. This is when Bill famously goes out and buys a green Porsche 911 and is motoring around Albuquerque, getting all sorts of speeding tickets and hilarious stuff.\\n\\nBen: This is when he got his mugshot, right?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I think that's right.\\n\\nBen: This is the classic Bill Gates holding up the...\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Amazing.\\n\\nBen: He got, I think, three speeding tickets in one day, two of which were from the same police officer.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and there are funny stories of the Albuquerque police thought, how is a kid driving a Porsche 911? He must be a drug dealer or something.\\n\\nBen: Even when he was 20–21, he looked 17.\\n\\nDavid: Right. It's like, do you even have a driver's license?\\n\\nBen: Wild.\\n\\nDavid: Back to what you're saying, it's a really, really important point. To make this dynamic work, you need to be able to afford the investment in the fixed cost for the software, for the technology to make it that little bit superior, like Bill's talking about, the slight advantage over the competitors. At this moment in time, the industry is completely brand new. The software industry is brand new.\\n\\nThe amount that that fixed costs takes, the cost is quite low. Really, it's just Bill and Paul's time and dedication to this industry that nobody else is making that investment. You can't run this playbook today because in any market, even a brand new market, even a speculative market, the minimum viable fixed cost is billions of dollars.\\n\\nBen: Right. Yeah, that's interesting. I also think this moment galvanized something important, which is Bill and Paul could look around and see that there is going to be so much value created by microcomputers and by software. They really found religion around software is magic. The things that people can create now that we've done this BASIC interpreter and these machines are cheap and plentiful. The magic will take care of itself as long as we ensure this industry can just exist and do its thing.\\n\\nThey flipped from this mode of we need to bite and scratch and claw, and make sure that we win in deals to, huh, how can we enable software as a thing to thrive? I'm sure we can position ourselves well to capture some or a lot of that. I think they became almost stewards of the software industry and evangelists from this point forward.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. They also do another really prescient thing the next year in 1978, which is they go global.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Nobody else is going global yet, and the way that this happens is so fun. Bill gets a call one day.\\n\\nBen: Also, how crazy is it? You've got five people, you're operating out of Albuquerque, you just finally expanded from having one customer, and you're like, you know what we should do this year? Let's open in Japan and become an international company.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. The way this happens is one day, Bill gets a call from a guy named Kazuhiko Nishi, or Kay Nishi, who's a computer enthusiast in Japan, has gotten a hold of Microsoft BASIC, and totally shares the same vision as Bill and Paul. He doesn't have a Paul nor is he technical himself.\\n\\nHe's like, I'm going to bring you guys to Japan. I'm going to bring you to all the big computer companies. They agree that Kay will become Microsoft's exclusive distribution partner in Japan. By the next year in 1979, half of Microsoft's revenue is coming from Japan, which is wild.\\n\\nBen: It's unbelievable, and it stayed at that very high run rate of an international being a huge chunk, close to half always basically forever. This is a huge cornerstone of Microsoft's success that they were an international company from year three of their existence.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Revenue in 1977, that last month of revenue was almost $400,000. 1978 revenue is $1.3 million.\\n\\nBen: They have 13 employees at this point.\\n\\nDavid: In 1979, revenue is $2.4 million. At the end of that year, they're like, all right, we got to get out of Albuquerque.\\n\\nBen: They've got 25 employees, I believe, at that point.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, something like that. This is when they moved to Seattle. It's interesting to hear Bill talk about this. He actually really liked Albuquerque. Specifically, there weren't any distractions there.\\n\\nBen: No distractions, weather was great.\\n\\nDavid: Everybody was happy there, but the big problem was recruiting. He's like, if we're going to build this into the opportunity that I see, the vision that I see and that Paul shares with me, there's no way we're going to do that in Albuquerque. We got to move to a hub.\\n\\nBen: He's got three reasons for why Seattle in particular. By the way, it worked. Every single person except for his secretary did make the move. (1) He grew up in Seattle. He's like, I just want to go home. He justifies it in two other ways, which I found pretty fascinating. This is from an interview in the early 90s that he did.\\n\\nHe said it basically came down to Seattle or Silicon Valley. In Silicon Valley, it's hard to keep secrets because there's a rumor mill. In Seattle, we can be a little bit more removed, and we can announce things when we want to announce them.\\n\\n(2) In Silicon Valley, people switch around companies. I don't want that. I want people to just work at Microsoft. There was a disadvantage to not being able to recruit from your competitors, but for a while, they were really the only game in town in Seattle.\\n\\nDavid: But not really, though, because pretty quickly, Microsoft is such an important part of the industry. They recruit from Silicon Valley, too. We're going to talk about some of the people who come up. You're totally right, people stay at Microsoft. They don't leave. This continues right through to this day.\\n\\nThe other thing that I think is really important to say that makes it work for Seattle in a way that I don't know that this could have worked in too many other places in the country is the University of Washington. The computer science department there was really good. There were great people. Steve Russell had come out there. There was real talent, and they were churning out graduates out of the U-Dub that would go on to populate Microsoft for decades to come.\\n\\nBen: Bill, of course, reinvested in that flywheel, donating tons of money to the university. There are buildings, there are whole new schools.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, absolutely. They played right into it.\\n\\nBen: Today, it's always a top 10, if not top 5 computer science program in the country. But unlike other top computer science programs, it's a state school, so it just has huge volumes. I think more students come out of the University of Washington and go to big tech than any other program in the country. That has stayed this amazing advantage.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I think the only thing even close to it is Berkeley in the Bay Area with a lot of the same dynamics. But there's Stanford there too, so it's a dual university system in the Bay Area. You cannot overstate how important the University of Washington was to this decision and an ultimate success of coming to Seattle.\\n\\nThis brings us to 1980 in the beginning of the year when they move to Seattle, just in time for, I think you can make a very strong argument, the single most important deal ever done in the history of technology. It's crazy to even say it now, the Microsoft-IBM PC partnership.\\n\\nBen: It's crazy. You have this absolute behemoth partnering with someone that's not really relevant. If you're standing here today, it sounds like I'm talking about Microsoft partnering with IBM. At the time, it was IBM partnering with Microsoft. It was the only computer company that mattered in the entire world, got themselves into a particular situation where they came to Microsoft looking for help. It's the craziest set of events that made this possible, and I can't wait to dive into it.\\n\\nDavid: Me too. Before we do, this is the perfect time to talk about another one of our favorite enterprise software platforms, ServiceNow, who is one of our big partners here in Season 14.\\n\\nBen: ServiceNow is the AI platform for your enterprise, helping automate processes, improve service delivery, and increase efficiency. Over 85% of the Fortune 500 runs on them, and they have quickly joined the Microsofts and the NVIDIAs as one of the most important enterprise technology vendors in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Just like those companies, ServiceNow has AI baked in everywhere in their platform, and they're also a major partner of both Microsoft and NVIDIA. I was at NVIDIA's GTC last week, which, by the way, was insane. I felt like a VIP at a Taylor Swift concert, it was crazy. Jensen brought up ServiceNow and their partnership many times throughout the keynote.\\n\\nWhy is ServiceNow so important both to NVIDIA and to Microsoft? AI in the real world is only as good as the bedrock platform infrastructure it runs on. For enterprises around the world, ServiceNow manages that infrastructure.\\n\\nAll the AI applications for enterprises, whether that's supercharging developers with generative AI, empowering and streamlining customer service, allowing HR to deliver better employee experiences, ServiceNow has already done the hard technical work to make rolling them out not just possible, but easy and fast.\\n\\nBen: Employees can get answers quickly with smarter self-service like changing 401(k) contributions directly through AI powered chat, or developers can build apps faster with AI powered code generation, and service agents can use AI to notify you that someone's product needs replacing before they even chat with you about it. With the ServiceNow platform, your business is 100% ready for AI. Simply turn it on, and it all works.\\n\\nDavid: They've built AI directly into their platform, so all the integration work to prepare for it that otherwise would have taken you years is already done. If you want to learn more about the ServiceNow platform and how it can turbocharge the time to deploy AI for your business, go on over to servicenow.com/acquired. When you get in touch, just tell them that Ben and David sent you.\\n\\nThe IBM PC. Why is IBM getting into the personal computer here in 1980? A fun quote we heard in our research was that IBM was the sun, the moon, the stars of the computing industry. That meant the hardcore enterprise mainframe computing industry.\\n\\nBen: David, are you going to attribute that quote or are you going to leave listeners just hanging?\\n\\nDavid: All right, I think it's time. We talked to probably 10 early Microsoft people in research and preparation. One of those folks was Steve Ballmer himself. He used those words in describing IBM.\\n\\nBen: And it's hard to imagine a better person to get their perspective on what IBM meant to the world at this point in time, because 1980 was also the year that Steve joined Microsoft. Literally at the same time in 1980, you've got the management team coming together with Steve, Bill, and Paul Allen, and you've got the IBM thing going on, and you've got them moving to Seattle. We haven't even talked about Charles Simonyi yet, but this was the year he joined.\\n\\nDavid: This is the year. Every year for Microsoft until this point is the year, but 1980 is big.\\n\\nBen: Okay, so why is IBM the sun, the moon, and the stars of computing? Why are they getting into this PC? It's way cheaper than anything else they sell. It seems to be a totally different business strategy, a different customer set. What's going on?\\n\\nDavid: All the early microcomputers we were just talking about, the Altair, the Apple II, the TRS-80, are all 8-bit machines. They're running the Intel 8080 processor or a competitor making a similar 8-bit processor. The problem with an 8-bit processor is that the maximum data size for a given instruction cycle in the processor—this is called a data word in computer science terminology—is 256, 28. You can't represent any number greater than 256 in any given CPU clock cycle in an 8-bit machine.\\n\\nBen: It's effectively a bandwidth limitation, where if you're in a single clock cycle trying to do some particular instruction, it's a very, very small amount of data that you can move through the arithmetic logic unit or that you can move through the processor in that clock cycle.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. You could think of it as an hourglass or something. There's all the data sitting there in memory at the top of the hourglass, and then there's this small little funnel that it goes through. That's the processor, and then it comes out.\\n\\nBen: That's a good analogy. It's going to take forever.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, into the application of the software that the user sees. You just are not really going to process it that fast.\\n\\nBen: Very primitive machines.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. For a company IBM, they eclipsed the 8-bit computing cycle a long, long, long time ago. Mainframes, even minicomputers with DEC, all these machines are at least 16-bit, if not 32-bit computing machines. 8-bit is just not interesting.\\n\\nBen: Which is why they only cost $375 or whatever for an Altair.\\n\\nDavid: Right. In late 1979, Intel announces that they're coming out with the 8086 processor, which is a 16-bit microprocessor. With 16 bits, you can really start to do some damage here in terms of the applications that you could put on this thing to eat into business software use cases.\\n\\nBen: In 16 bits, you can represent numbers up to 65,536, so that's two to the 16th. You can do interesting things passing 16 bits around at once.\\n\\nDavid: There are some really, really fun aspects to this. If you look at pictures of these processors, what did the 8080, the 8-bit processor look like? And then you look at what the 8086, the 16-bit processor, looked like? You can see this.\\n\\nIn the 8008 processor that's only eight bits, you see only nine pins coming off of the little chip. There's the eight pins for the data bits, and then I think there's one more control pin. If you look at the 8086 processor, it's a much longer rectangle with 16, 17, maybe 20 pins coming off of it. You see this physically represented in the chip.\\n\\nBen: The further we get in the computing world, the more abstract stuff becomes. It's always fun to go back in history when these concepts were so grounded in our physical reality that's easily observable since everything was so much bigger too.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Back in 1980, the 8086 has been announced, 16-bit microprocessor is coming. IBM has already lived through missing a computing expansion era once with DEC and the minicomputer. They just let DEC take that market. Of course, that didn't really hurt IBM, but man, it would have been nice to also have that market too.\\n\\nBen: The thing that they're observing about the microcomputer market is it's exploding. People in our industry know about DEC, people in the broader world never knew about DEC. But I think it's a very different rate of adoption and rate of demand with microcomputers where IBM started to look at and go, oh, this might be a really big computer market for people.\\n\\nDavid: They're finally observing the same thing that Bill and Paul did all the way back in the Traf-O-Date days of this is an exponential cycle. Moore's law, this is exponential, and exponential gets real big very quickly once you get a few years in.\\n\\nBen: Yup.\\n\\nDavid: The mini computer cycle never was that. It's hard to remember today, but just to underscore this again, in 1980, IBM was the most valuable company in the entire world, the highest market cap company, bigger than all the oil companies in 1980.\\n\\nBen: The sun, the moon, and the stars.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Do you know what their market capital was?\\n\\nBen: In 1980, $150 billion?\\n\\nDavid: You are almost an order of magnitude off $34 billion. That was the most valuable company. It is wild what a different world we live in today.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, even inflation adjusted, it's interesting that the rate of growth of the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap has far outpaced inflation.\\n\\nDavid: That company, the most valuable in the world, they're going to tiny little Microsoft that's just moved to Seattle for this partnership. What's going on here? This is just so amazing. They deserve so much credit here. They got the Clay Christensen disrupt yourself, disruptive technology thing intuitively decades before Clay writes any of this stuff.\\n\\nThe way that they decide to compete is all the things that Clay wrote about are working against us here. What we need to do is we need to create essentially a skunk works division, just our Lockheed episode. We need to do something outside the company, completely removed from the politics, sure, but the business incentives not to disrupt ourselves, and create a new division they called the entry level systems division. Actually, it may have existed before, but they repurpose it.\\n\\nBen: This is in Boca Raton?\\n\\nDavid: In Boca Raton, Florida. Very nice place. We were just there a couple of months ago, but not a technology hotbed in the world. They create a secret project called Project Chess, secret from the rest of the company, the whole world. The goal is to develop the IBM microcomputer or the personal computer, as people are starting to refer to microcomputers.\\n\\nThis is wild. They're going to do it in secret with a small team with no other IBM resources. That means this small team, the only way they can do it is to use all off-the-shelf components from technology providers, basically play on the same level playing field as all the other microcomputer manufacturers out there.\\n\\nOne more thing, IBM leadership tells this team in Boca, they have to ship the PC to customers within one year.\\n\\nBen: It's a crazy constraint.\\n\\nDavid: It is a total crazy constraint. A couple of quotes on this. Don Estridge, who is one of the leaders of Project Chess, would later say that the company realized that if you're going to compete against people who started in a garage, obviously a reference to Apple here, you have to start in a garage yourself. Lou Gerstner, who later would take over IBM, would describe this whole Boca project as, \\\"The way you get an elephant to tap dance.\\\"\\n\\nBen: The question is, are they playing from behind and thus have to adopt a flawed strategy, or is this strategy of assembling with all off-the-shelf components actually a good strategy if it works?\\n\\nDavid: Let's tell the story and then come back to it.\\n\\nBen: Great.\\n\\nDavid: Okay. What do they do? The hardware aspect of this is trivial, basically. Ed Roberts could put together the hardware to sell a microcomputer and do this deal with Intel. I think IBM can do a deal with Intel, not necessarily trickier but the more important part is the software. Thanks to Bill's genius strategy about be the volume player, don't optimize on per unit price, set the standards out there.\\n\\nBen: They were the world's leading provider of programming language interpreters, right?\\n\\nDavid: 100%. There is one game in town and one game in town only, and that is Microsoft in Bellevue, Washington at this point in time.\\n\\nBen: Now, interpreters are notably different from operating systems, but Microsoft definitely has raised the flag. Everyone could see, if I want to go buy software for my computers, broadly, they're an interesting group to talk to.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Obviously, operating systems are going to become really, really big here in just a sec. Again, the 8-bit generation operating systems weren't that important because people were writing their own software. The standardized software, packaged application software doesn't happen until the 16-bit era and doesn't really, really happen until the 16-bit era and the IBM PC. That's why BASIC the interpreter is so important.\\n\\nWhat happens? IBM calls up Bill Gates. By August, 1980, the two companies are in serious talks to partner and work together on the IBM PC. We referenced Steve Ballmer a minute ago. The timing is just crazy. Steve had just joined the company in June of 1980.\\n\\nBen: He's employee number 30.\\n\\nDavid: The Microsoft team of 30, which the whole company of Microsoft pivots to work on the IBM PC partnership, is bigger than the Project Chess team in Boca.\\n\\nBen: It's amazing.\\n\\nDavid: Wow. Okay, Bill has just convinced Steve to drop out of business school at Stanford and come help him and Paul run the company. Microsoft at this point in time is still a partnership. Steve is the first person besides Bill and Paul to get equity in the company when he joins. It's 8.5% and it's a handshake deal at this point.\\n\\nBen: Bill really, really wanted to bring Steve on. He knew him from the Harvard days, knew what an asset he could be.\\n\\nDavid: He is the Yin of Bill's Yang.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Frankly, 8.5%, it's a big grant. Who's out there running a 30-person company, and you're giving away 8.5% slugs? That just doesn't happen. Those are founder shares. This is really a reflection that the way that Bill thought about Steve was as a founder.\\n\\nIn fact, it created some tension with Paul Allen, where Bill asked Paul, if they could go to 5%, Paul said, sure. And then Bill actually offered him 8.5%. Paul got upset and Bill said, I'll eat the 3.5%. It can come out of my share because I want him that bad.\\n\\nDavid: He's the perfect person for this point in time. Bill was the only salesperson doing these OEM deals. Now they're dealing with IBM. They're entering the enterprise world. This needs to be a real business.\\n\\nBack to the IBM negotiations, obviously Microsoft is very interested. IBM is not just very interested in working with Microsoft. They have to work with Microsoft. They're the only game in town.\\n\\nBen: Specifically, they asked Microsoft for programming languages. They're like, we're making this great PC, we're going to need a BASIC. We think you guys are working on a COBOL. We'd like some COBOL.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, Fortran. Give us the whole thing. There's some debate on whether it was the Microsoft side or the IBM side that really saw the vision of, hey, the 16-bit generation is going to enable real business software use cases on the personal computer, but it doesn't matter. That's the plan here, and that is absolutely what happens.\\n\\nThese initial discussions are for the programming language. Microsoft doesn't make an operating system at this point, because in the 8-bit generation, the operating system, I think, was a glorified bootloader to just get into the programming environment so that you could either write or load up the BASIC programs that Microsoft was going to interpret and then run.\\n\\nIn the 8-bit generation, most, if not all hardware providers of microcomputers just wrote their own operating systems. It just wasn't a big deal. Now, there was one off-the-shelf operating system out there from a company called Digital Research, which was run by Gary Kildall, who, I think as we talked about earlier, Bill and Paul had actually intersected with back in Seattle.\\n\\nBen: Yup. I think they were reasonably friendly.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I think they were quite friendly because they partnered. You needed the operating system to get into the programming environment. It wasn't that big of a deal. Whenever anybody needed one off-the-shelf, Bill and Microsoft would just refer people over to Digital to get it.\\n\\nBen: Yup. CP/M, right?\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. CP/M, which I think is maybe Control Program for Microprocessors, I think, is the abbreviation there.\\n\\nBen: God, they were so bad. Every single thing that's been named to this point, except for the company Microsoft, was a horrible name. The processor is 8008, and now it's 8080, but the machine is 8800, that the processor is inside. Give me a break, everyone. It's horrible naming.\\n\\nDavid: Bill and I'm sure Paul too, but Bill is the only person in this industry that has the vision for what this can become, even Intel. Bill talks about this. He doesn't think that Intel even realizes what's happening here. They're just like, oh, we're just making more chips, and people use them for stuff.\\n\\nBen: It does seem like very few people are thinking about their products as something they really need to build a brand around with consumers, hence the naming schemes.\\n\\nDavid: The IBM, Microsoft discussions are going along. IBM's like, oh, hey, yeah, we need an operating system. Bill, I think from everything we've read and folks we've talked to, in good faith just does the standard thing he's always done in these situations. He's like, oh yeah, go talk to Gary, go talk to Digital Research. He can probably do that.\\n\\nBen: Right. We don't have an operating system, this guy does.\\n\\nDavid: What happens next is unclear. But what is clear is however it goes down, this is one of, if not the biggest business blunder in history. IBM, that team from Project Chess, flies down, I think, directly from Seattle and talking with Bill and Steve to Monterey, California, where Digital Research is based at this point, to meet with Gary and his wife, Dorothy, who run the business together. Bill's called them. He's like, hey, I got a big OEM client coming down, needs an operating system.\\n\\nBen: He signed hefty, hefty NDAs. He cannot say who it is, but he's like, you really should take this seriously.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The team comes down. Obviously, they show up there from IBM. There's a big snafu where Gary does not attend the meeting. There are conflicting reports about what happened.\\n\\nBen: Was it one of them that he's out flying an airplane?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I'm pretty sure he was flying his personal airplane while this happens. Some reports are he was just out joyriding and missed it. Some reports are no, he was on a business trip, knew it was happening, but he had another important business meeting. He didn't know that this was IBM that was coming. Regardless, it doesn't really matter because IBM just wants the operating system.\\n\\nDorothy does meet with them. She's unwilling to sign their NDA. There's a lawyer from Digital Research who gets involved, and he doesn't really understand what's going on.\\n\\nThe punchline is that IBM leaves this interaction with the belief that Gary and Digital Research aren't up for working with them and aren't capable of producing here. Producing is important because it's not like the existing CP/M OS that they made would work here. They would have to write a new version, a 16-bit version, and they hadn't done that yet.\\n\\nBen: In particular, they would have to do some customizing. But part of what IBM wants is a customized version of an operating system for the IBM PC. They don't want this to be fully off-the-shelf.\\n\\nJust to add one more stir the pot of history here, there is another version of this story where Gary does actually have a conversation with IBM, and it blows up over licensing terms. What Gary really wants is a significant royalty of every IBM PC sold, and IBM walks over that. Whether that happened or whether it's just an NDA issue, either way, I think we all know the IBM PC did not end up running the CP/M operating system.\\n\\nDavid: That's amazing. I didn't know that. We'll talk about that when we get to the business terms of the Microsoft IBM deal in a minute. But for the moment, there's no deal yet because an operating system needs to be provided here.\\n\\nIBM goes back to Microsoft and they're like, hey, this guy you referred us to ain't going to work. The way that I read some quotes from the IBM people here were like, we just threw the problem back in Microsoft's lap of you guys deal with this, you source an operating system.\\n\\nI'd like to say that Bill, Steve, and Microsoft, you don't need to give them an opportunity twice. In this case, you did need to give them an opportunity twice because they almost flubbed it and sent IBM down to see Gary. This time they don't flub it. They're like, okay, we'll get you an operating system.\\n\\nBen: Enter Seattle Computer Products.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. It just so happens that right down the road from Microsoft in the Seattle area—I think despite being named Seattle Computer Products, I think this company was actually based in Tukwila, Washington—a programmer named Tim Patterson had just written a 16-bit operating system for the 8086 that Intel had just announced, and he was calling it the Quick and Dirty 16-bit Operating System or QDOS for short, and had it ready to go.\\n\\nWhy had he written this? What was this company, Seattle Computer Products? Why did they have an operating system? They were a component provider to microcomputer manufacturers. They essentially made motherboards. When Intel now has announced this new 16-bit processor generation that they're coming out with, Seattle Computer Products want to sell motherboards and have them ready for 16-bit.\\n\\nThey need to test and play around with these things, and their customers are asking for it. They had been going to Kildall and Digital Research too and badgering them to like, hey, write the 16-bit version of CP/M. Gary just didn't, so Tim's like, fine, I'll do a quick and dirty version myself, and thus DOS is born.\\n\\nBen: Incredible, which of course later, they would drop the Q and call it DOS, the Disk Operating System. Something about dirty didn't have a ring to it when you're selling it to IBM.\\n\\nDavid: No. Bill, Paul, and Microsoft have learned about this. They know Seattle Computer Products, they know Rod Brock, the guy who owns the company. They get in touch with him and they say, hey, can we license QDOS from you and Tim? We've got a big OEM customer that wants a 16-bit operating system. They work out a deal whereby Microsoft pays Seattle Computer Products $25,000 for the rights to adapt and sell QDOS to the one unnamed original equipment manufacturer who they're working with.\\n\\nTim, actually, is jazzed about this. He ends up leaving SCP computer products and joining Microsoft. With the rest of the team, he's part of building DOS, taking his initial work and turning it into real DOS. Later on, before this all gets announced and the PC ships, Microsoft would pay Seattle computer products another $50,000 for full rights to own 86 QDOS, sell and license it to anybody else indefinitely. I believe the total amount of dollars that changed hands here is $75,000.\\n\\nBen: Unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: This is DOS. One programmer wrote a \\\"quick and dirty\\\" operating system, and Microsoft bought the license to that and adapted it into DOS. Tim, when he was at Seattle computer products, definitely did not write DOS as DOS. It's not like Microsoft bought all of DOS for $75,000. They did a lot of work on it, but this is how it all goes down.\\n\\nBen: Microsoft would eventually generate billions of dollars on DOS-based products. You're exactly right in the same way that Instagram today is a much different code base than Instagram and much larger code base than Instagram when it was purchased, but my God, $75,000 to buy DOS to get this whole thing started. Until Windows 95, all of the Windows operating systems were DOS-based.\\n\\nDavid: It's just crazy. It really illustrates how fast things were moving, how much all this was getting invented and discovered in real time that even to this point, Bill Gates isn't thinking that operating systems are that important. This is just a shortcut to get the deal done with IBM to make it happen.\\n\\nBen: Also, David, I got to say, I just looked it up. The address of Seattle Computer Products, on the original business card for Seattle Computer Products where I presume QDOS was written, the space is available, so I know where our next studio needs to be.\\n\\nDavid: It's in Tequila?\\n\\nBen: It's in Tequila.\\n\\nDavid: All right. The rent can't be that expensive then, so let's do it.\\n\\nBen: Correct.\\n\\nDavid: Hell, yeah. We've been joking for years about making the Acquired Museum. We might have a location.\\n\\nOkay. Now they've got the operating system, they've got QDOS or DOS in place to license the IBM. The only thing that is left to formalize the partnership is the business terms.\\n\\nBen, if what you said is right about the Gary Kildall IBM negotiations, this is just a master stroke from Bill here in the licensing with IBM, because there are two really, really big levers that it looks like Bill is giving big time on one of them, but he is winning big time on the other one.\\n\\nBen: What are they?\\n\\nDavid: The one that it looks like he's giving on is he does another fixed cost OEM deal with IBM.\\n\\nBen: This is in Paul Allen's memoir. IBM paid Microsoft $75,000 for testing and consultation, $45,000 for DOS, and $310,000 for an array of 16-bit language interpreters and compilers. All told, bundled together, that is $430,000 fixed that IBM paid Microsoft with no ongoing obligation.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. No per copy royalties. Every copy of DOS that IBM sells is either included as part of systems that they're selling, or they're free to charge independently for DOS, whatever amount they want, Microsoft gets $0. If it's true that this is where things fell apart with Gary Kildall, crazy that Bill is willing to do this.\\n\\nBen: You might say, what? Didn't Bill learn his lesson? Why would he ever agree to this?\\n\\nDavid: On the one hand, this is what he was doing with Apple and others. He was doing these fixed cost deals. He would think, man, IBM, this is the time. People aren't going to pirate IBM software. Now's the time to really grab the money bags.\\n\\nBen: But Bill saw something that no one else did.\\n\\nDavid: I don't know if it was directly in exchange in the negotiations, but the other lever that he saw, that he pulled was Microsoft retained the rights to own DOS and to own their languages and license it and them to anyone else they wanted at any price on any terms.\\n\\nBen: It's so interesting, because what ended up happening that Bill Gates masterminded was once we distribute our operating system through IBM's PC, that's going to become the thing everyone buys. Now, in the 16-bit generation, when there are people building programs for computers, not just developers, once those application developers who are writing programs are targeting an operating system, then that is the operating system that every other OEM, every other computer maker is also going to want and really need, and we're going to be the ones that they have to come to to buy it.\\n\\nI can't figure out, did IBM miss this fact? Or did they know it? Basically, what IBM did was they were the one place where every business needed to go for their computer needs. What they did in this negotiation was they actually handed that over to Microsoft. They said, we are going to become a commodity, just like every other hardware manufacturer, and you are going to be the point of integration for the whole ecosystem. You're going to be the linchpin that everyone has to target for their applications.\\n\\nDavid: I think there are two things going on here, one small and one big. The small thing is actually related all the way back to the beginning of the episode, what you said, Ben, about the antitrust concerns within IBM. To hear them say it, they actually didn't want ownership of the software. They wanted it to be separate because it would look better.\\n\\nBen: Because then they have the plausible deniability of, how could we possibly have a monopoly? We're buying off-the-shelf...\\n\\nDavid: Part of an ecosystem, blah-blah-blah. Yeah.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. From a vendor who can sell to anybody else. We have no lock in.\\n\\nDavid: That may well be true. I think the bigger thing that just wasn't in their consideration or mindset was they (I think) assumed that once they entered the PC market, IBM was going to be the dominant player, so it didn't matter. Once IBM is selling PCs, who's going to buy a PC from anybody else? IBM is going to win this market.\\n\\nBen: Just like they have in every other line of business they've been in.\\n\\nDavid: What Bill saw was he really made a bet that the same dynamics that played out with the Altair were also going to play out with the IBM PC. There would be a million hardware manufacturers, flowers blooming here.\\n\\nBen: Building to the same spec.\\n\\nDavid: Building to the same spec.\\n\\nBen: Using the same processor.\\n\\nDavid: Which of course, they could because it was all off-the-shelf components. IBM either didn't see or didn't believe that that would actually happen.\\n\\nBen: IBM failed to see the value of software, and they certainly failed to understand what a software platform business model would be.\\n\\nDavid: Which makes sense. Why would they? They are the computing company.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Their experience in selling mainframes with everything bundled in was the wrong experience to go off of in understanding the way the future would unfold. Bill's very modest experience watching the Altair and all these Altair clone type machines, or even if they're not Altair clones, just more microcomputers that need more software, actually was the useful experience to pattern match off of of what does the world of microcomputers look like, and how is that fundamentally different than the world of mainframes.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. In a way that the mini computer generation, like we've been saying, it was like a half generation. It wasn't actually fundamentally that different other than DEC gained a foothold.\\n\\nBen: The deal that Bill Gates made with IBM for the IBM PC is the greatest deal in at least computer industry history, if not all business history, full stop.\\n\\nDavid: Let's say a little bit about why. It's obvious, but here now is IBM, most valuable company in the world. They're going to come out with the PC platform. They are going to build the market. Microsoft is going to own the linchpin, in Hamilton Helmer terms, where the power is in the market, and they're going to be free to license it at whatever terms they want to any other player who wants to enter.\\n\\nThey signed this agreement in November 1980. The IBM PC ships in August 1981. Just incredible, almost exactly a little more than a year from the time Project Chess starts to when they actually ship the PC.\\n\\nBen: Truly incredible, they pulled it off.\\n\\nDavid: Truly incredible. It changes the world. That's such a trite thing to say, but everything that everybody's imagining happens.\\n\\nBen: IBM was right that it was by far in a way the most successful personal computer on the market as soon as they released it.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. They sell 13,500 IBM PCs within the first couple of months after they announce it. Over the next two years, they sell half a million of them, makes them unquestionably the largest personal microcomputer manufacturer/market leader. Everybody at IBM is celebrating. The clones haven't arrived yet, and maybe they won't. It'll play out like they think. Not exactly.\\n\\nBefore we talk about the clones, this is really just a footnote because of course all the incentives are aligned for IBM to push DOS as the operating system for the PC. They've done this whole deal with Microsoft. They have a royalty-free deal with them.\\n\\nWhen they launch the PC, customers actually have a choice of which operating system they want on their IBM PC. They don't have to go with DOS. Consumers can choose between DOS, 16-bit CP/M. By this point in time, Gary and Digital Research have gotten their act together. They've written a 16-bit version of the CPM operating system. Or another 16-bit operating system called Pascal that came out of the University of California at San Diego.\\n\\nThe price sheet for the operating system option is Pascal is an extra $450 with your IBM PC. CP/M is an extra $175 with your IBM PC, and DOS, which was developed specifically for the PC is the best way to run it is only $60. IBM is making $60 of full 100% margin on top of their hardware for the PC by selling DOS because they don't have to pay Microsoft any of that, and they've set up the incentives that obviously everybody's going to choose DOS.\\n\\nBen: It's fascinating. And you know what? To give them a little bit more credit too, they did try to enforce that there's some amount of lock-in to the IBM PC. They did that in two ways. One is we're simplifying calling it DOS. It was PC-DOS, which is different than MS-DOS, which would get licensed to other computer makers. I don't know exactly what happened, but it basically seems like it just wasn't different enough to be meaningful to application developers. That's one piece of it.\\n\\nThe second is IBM did actually have proprietary BIOS. That was another part where they thought that that might provide them some protection, where they could stay a linchpin in the ecosystem. It wasn't just all off-the-shelf. They actually did have something that was theirs that was proprietary.\\n\\nDavid: It just turned out that the effort required to reverse engineer the IBM BIOS was trivial, basically.\\n\\nBen: Do you know the story of the Compaq BIOS?\\n\\nDavid: I know the Compaq story, but I don't know the story of the BIOS specifically. Enlighten us.\\n\\nBen:  It is basically why Compaq worked is what it comes down to. Compaq was formed basically to clone the IBM PC. They saw the market opportunity, and they realized they could buy from all the same equipment vendors. Let's go eat their margin is basically the plan.\\n\\nHowever, the one thing that was not off-the-shelf is the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), which is effectively the thing that decides to load the operating system when you turn the machine on. There's some proprietary magic that happens to call upon the operating system to do its thing. Compaq reverse engineered the BIOS. The way that they did it was very similar to Trip Hawkins and the story that he told us about his reverse engineering at Electronic Arts.\\n\\nDavid: Of the Psychogenesis.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Compaq had two engineers. One engineer went in and fully dissected the code for the IBM PC BIOS, basically saw all the proprietary calls that it made, and documented each of those calls without writing the implementation steps. Then he handed, hey, here's what the BIOS needs to interface with, over to the other engineer. The other engineer, on their own, just went through and thought of an implementation.\\n\\nThey have no idea if it's the same implementation, so it's not breaking any infringement. They're basically saying, I'm just seeing the requirements for this product, and I'm coming up with my own implementation of that product. They basically figured out how to exactly clone the IBM PC and buy the very same operating system.\\n\\nTo go back to quoting Ben Thompson because this is from his great piece again, \\\"The result was a company that came to dominate the market. Compaq was the fastest startup to ever hit $100 million in revenue, then the youngest firm to break into the Fortune 500, then the fastest company to hit $1 billion in revenue, and by 1994, Compaq was the largest PC maker in the world.\\\"\\n\\nDavid: The Compaq story is amazing. The three people who start Compaq in 1982 are actually Texas Instruments engineers who left, and they wanted to start a company. I believe as the legend goes, they were trying to decide what to start. They were considering a restaurant chain and a bunch of different business ideas. The IBM PC comes out at the end of 1981 and they're like, oh, we can clone this and do everything, the story you just told. It's wild. They start the company in 1982. Within the first year, they do $111 million of revenue of selling IBM PC clone hardware.\\n\\nBen: And is it just cheaper? Basically this is the IBM PC, but for less money?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, exactly. Same thing, cheaper.\\n\\nBen: So begins the race to the bottom of PC hardware. Completely undifferentiated, all the value accrues to the software layer.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Compaq went public the very next year, in 1983 well before Microsoft, which is funny. Compaq, all these other clone companies that get started. Microsoft licenses DOS to all of them importantly, critically, on a per-machine-sold basis. This is when they grab the money. The operating system is so deeply embedded and needs to get shipped with the computer itself.\\n\\nConsumers can go buy operating systems to upgrade and whatnot, but no hardware manufacturer is going to ship a 16-bit PC without an operating system. Piracy is not an issue here. Microsoft can now do a per-copy-sold, per-machine-sold license with all these clones. My God, it's just a geyser of money.\\n\\nBen: Microsoft used IBM to generate demand for their software, and then they used every other PC manufacturer to capture the value that all that demand created.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I think I have these numbers and timeframes right. I believe that for calendar year 1982, Microsoft's revenue was $25 million. I think this must have been when they switched to fiscal year end and June 30th. Microsoft's fiscal year end starting then and up through now is June 30th.\\n\\nThey're fiscal 1984. The year ended June 30th, 1984, so 1983 midpoint to 1984 midpoint. Microsoft does $98 million. In an 18-month period from the end of 1982, they go from $25–$98 million. It's all on the back of the clones. Unlike Compaq that they did $111 million of revenue their first year, they're selling hardware which has serious cogs associated with it. Microsoft, 100% essentially, gross margin, software revenue, more than doubling year on year. It's the best business of all time.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and they combined two magical principles together. This infinite replicability, zero marginal costs of software, and becoming the linchpin of the ecosystem. They are now the software that everyone needs to target, which gives them pricing power. That pricing power raises your top line, and you have no costs. It's unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: Meanwhile, in the computing industry background, while all this is going on with the launch of the IBM PC and then the clones, Apple had gone public at the end of 1980 in I think, the biggest and most successful IPO of all time at that point. Remember we talked about Genentech on the Novo Nordisk episode. They went public right before Apple, and then Apple was bigger. They're valued at $1.8 billion at IPO. Steve Jobs is this multi hundred millionaire, media darling, all this stuff.\\n\\nThe next year in 1981, Microsoft reorganizes from the partnership between Bill and Paul with the handshake deal that Steve's going to be cut in on the partnership into a stock company, a C-corporation. As part of doing that, the venture firm, Technology Venture Investors (TVI) invest $1 million, I believe, for 5% of the company. This is crazy. That's a $20 million post money valuation.\\n\\nBen: It's a 1-on-20 post when Microsoft is doing how much in revenue?\\n\\nDavid: That year, they did $17 million in revenue, and they're about to do the IBM deal. This is absolutely absurd.\\n\\nBen: It says a lot about this period of time that you could do a 1X revenue deal in a high-margin software company. I actually don't think this shows a weakness in Microsoft. Oh, they didn't have leverage or something that. That wasn't it at all, it was just the deals sucked.\\n\\nDavid: Venture capital sucked back then. There's no other way to put it.\\n\\nBen: It's only 5%, so good on Microsoft. Spoiler alert, this is the only dilution that they would ever take. That's also extremely different than today, but a $20 million valuation at this stage is frankly ludicrous.\\n\\nDavid: Even among people who should be in the know, the beauty of the software business model still is something people don't understand.\\n\\nBen: That's exactly right.\\n\\nDavid: The hotness is the hardware. It's like Apple just IPO'd. Apple's worth $1.8 billion. Like, ooh, that's the industry, ooh, it's IBM, et cetera. When Microsoft itself would go public a few years later in 1986, they actually go public the same week that they moved to the big campus in Redmond, where they are to this day. Their market cap at IPO is only $750 million despite having done $200 million of very high margin software revenue in the trailing 12 months up to that, growing 100% year over year. It's insane.\\n\\nBen: Hey, that's 4X multiple expansion off the last time they raised money.\\n\\nDavid: Right? It's just crazy that people don't yet appreciate the power.\\n\\nBen: Bill Gates and Warren Buffett did a conversation at the University of Washington in 1998. This is as late as 1998. This thing that we're talking about, the magic of the software business model and how it should be reflected in a company's valuation especially when it's a high-growth company was still not understood even by Bill Gates himself.\\n\\nHere's the quote. Bill Gates says, \\\"I think the multiples of technology stocks should be quite a bit lower than the multiples of stocks like Coke and Gillette because we are subject to complete changes in the rules. I know very well that in the next 10 years, if Microsoft is still a leader, we will have had to weather at least three crises.\\\" Bill Gates is essentially making an argument. Granted, this is in the middle of all the antitrust stuff, so he's very prime for this.\\n\\nDavid: And the Internet.\\n\\nBen: And the Internet. He's basically making the argument that disruptive forces come at you so fast in the technology industry that even though you can grow extremely fast, it's this extremely scalable thing, distributing software at zero distribution costs, and even though the margins are unbelievable because you have zero marginal costs, they still shouldn't be valued as highly as a CPG company, which is so different than the way that people think about it today.\\n\\nDavid: It's funny. I've thought about this a lot, and I actually watched that interview years ago. It's so good. There are elements of truth to this too. I think it's that for most technology companies, that is totally true. For a few technology companies that have true power and true scale, the exact opposite is true. Microsoft is still the most valuable company in the world today.\\n\\nBen: Companies that are less susceptible to disruption, more predictable in terms of high growth, high margin revenue deserve a premium. But Gates is basically arguing, everyone else doesn't.\\n\\nLet's flash all the way back to 1981 and talk about this venture capital investment, this 1-on-20 that TVI does.\\n\\nDavid: Good work if you can get a man.\\n\\nBen: How does this come to be? Even a whole year before in the fall of 1980, Dave Marquardt, one of the partners and the founders at TVI, flies up to Seattle not to meet Bill Gates, but to meet Steve Ballmer.\\n\\nDavid: Because they were classmates at GSB, right?\\n\\nBen: They weren't quite classmates, but because I think they were two years apart, so they didn't overlap, but they had some of the same social circles. Steve was effectively the screener for anyone who wanted to come and talk to Bill and try and invest in the business.\\n\\nTA Associates had been up, Sutter Hill had been up, Hambrick and Quist had been up, Xerox Ventures, and all of them only ever got to meet with Steve Ballmer and never got passed on to Bill Gates. Steve would basically just bounce them off. I know all this because there's a great oral history from the Computer History Museum, where this whole thing's in a transcript with an interview with Dave Marquardt recalling the whole thing.\\n\\nDave flies up to meet with Steve. Steve says, you're asking really interesting questions. You're thinking about our strategy the right way. You don't just want to do a transactional deal. You really think this is something special. Why don't you meet with Bill? Bill, of course, doesn't have any extra time in his schedule. He says, but I am going to the U-Dub Arizona football game at Husky stadium. Why don't you come and talk to me there?\\n\\nOf course they go, Bill doesn't pay attention to the game at all. He's just laying out the strategy, grilling Dave, and talking about software the whole time. This is fall of 1980. That's a whole year before the deal gets done. Dave's remarking at this point in 1980, they're doing $5 million in revenue, $2–$3 million in profit. They don't need VC money, and yet he was able to get in.\\n\\nHere's the quote. \\\"I was just helping them out with the business. In the venture business, you're buying and you're selling at the same time. You're trying to figure out, are these guys crazy? Are they ever going to do anything really interesting? If so, how do I get myself positioned to be able to help them do it? So I spent a lot of time up there helping recruit people. I helped to recruit Charles Simonyi, who was an early key guy.\\\" Charles Simonyi would go on, this is an aside, to write Microsoft Word. Charles was at Xerox PARC inventing the GUI.\\n\\nDavid: We're going to talk about Charles in just a sec.\\n\\nBen: Yes. He says, “And I was working with Steve on business strategy. They had these OEM customers, the PC manufacturers, and they had started to engage with IBM on this operating system. Are we just going to become a low-cost contract programming shop for IBM, an outsourced sweatshop? Or is there some way we can build a business out of this?\\n\\nWhich led to the fixed fee to IBM, the retention of the code, which then we could sell to other people. That's what created the PC industry basically.” That is his recollection of the whole thing, that he was very helpful in this transformative time for the company. At the same time, you have to look at everyone else's incentives.\\n\\nDavid: How can I be helpful, Ben?\\n\\nBen: Dave is only 29 years old, but everyone else is 23. He actually is adult supervision. At the same time, the partnership was still just a partnership, and there was a handshake deal for the equity. If you're Steve Ballmer at this point in history, it would be nice to have a forcing function to actually turn this into a corporation so that we can get some shares granted here. There's a little bit of incentive to say, hey, if we take on an outside investor, we're going to have to restructure.\\n\\nDavid: That's what I had always read about the TVI investment. Obviously, Microsoft didn't need the money. They like Dave, but also a big part of it was this was a catalyzing function to do the conversion into a C-corp.\\n\\nBen: Yes. This would create a little bit of board and governance, so it's not just Bill all the time. Bill, of course, I think is still the controlling shareholder just by the amount of stock that he owns. But there's a board. It's Bill, it's Dave, and it's Kay Nishi. It's a three-person board.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, we should say-to-vis a vis Paul, tragically, and I believe it was 1982-1983, he's diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. He ends up taking a leave and then fully leaving the company. I think he did go on and off the board at various points in time.\\n\\nBen: That's true.\\n\\nDavid: But he's no longer a full-time member of the company after his diagnosis.\\n\\nBen: Yup. On this venture investment, it's pretty fascinating. None of these are terribly compelling reasons other than, I guess, it would be nice to have a little bit of capital associated with us formalizing the corporation, but they don't need money at all. They're printing cash. They've been printing cash ever since that one tight period in Albuquerque. Dave charmed them. I think that's the answer.\\n\\nDavid: I've always heard wonderful, wonderful things about Dave, and I think everybody really did love him and see his value. But man, to be a venture capitalist in the 1980s and 1990s, oh, man, you couldn't lose.\\n\\nBen: It's pretty crazy. I think part of it too had to do with the fact that Microsoft was up in Seattle. The VCs just weren't traveling. Dave was young and he was single.\\n\\nDavid: Don Valentine famously had the rule. They didn't invest in any company that you couldn't bicycle to from Sand Hill Road.\\n\\nBen: It's crazy. Dave Marquardt, I think most weekends, is flying up to Seattle to hang out with Bill and Steve. It was a real sell. He says, I was young, I was single, I had nothing better to do, and it was really fun and intellectually interesting, so I did it. That resulted in, depending how long TVI held, one of, if not the best venture capital return in history.\\n\\nDavid: Hard to argue with that one. Okay, back to the story. There are a couple more really, really key things that happened in the PC era. Particularly now, once we're into the IBM PC era and the clones, the 16-bit era. Let's start with applications.\\n\\nLike we've been saying all along, the 8-bit era, applications, package software aren't really a thing. In 1979, at the tail end of the 8-bit era, two programs come out for the Apple II, VisiCalc and WordStar. VisiCalc is the first software spreadsheet application, and WordStar is a word processor. These applications by today's standards are super simple, stone age–type stuff, but they're the first of their kind, particularly VisiCalc and the spreadsheet. They established the potential for business applications on personal computers.\\n\\nThere's a joke at one point in the industry that the Apple II was a \\\"VisiCalc\\\" accessory for small businesses. I think that is part of what IBM is seeing and why they're deciding to now get into the industry with the personal computer. Around this time, Microsoft starts the \\\"Consumer Products Division\\\" to compete and make application software themselves.\\n\\nBen: It's quite telling it's called the Consumer Products Division to make applications. Even though they're competing to make these applications that today we would view as business tools, spreadsheets, and word processing, that is not how they referred to it.\\n\\nDavid: Right. One of the first people that they hire into this new division to get it going is an engineer, Ben, who you referenced just a minute ago, named Charles Simonyi. They poach Charles, perhaps with Dave Marquardt's help, away from the legendary Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC). I think this is one of the great misconceptions in technology history. Hopefully we can set the record straight a little bit here.\\n\\nBen: Yes. If you ask anybody in our ecosystem, save for the 1% of people who actually know this, what happened at Xerox PARC? They will tell you they invented the mouse, they invented the graphical user interface, and then Steve Jobs walked in, he saw it all, and he said, oh, my God, we have to have it. He went off and he made the Lisa, which had a graphical user interface and a mouse. That failed, but what succeeded was the Macintosh, and it's a wholesale ripoff of Xerox PARC that lives on today in Apple. That is the story that you will hear from basically everyone.\\n\\nDavid: I've heard it characterized as something like Xerox hosted a picnic in Silicon Valley, and Steve Jobs attended and dined lavishly at the feast.\\n\\nBen: All of this is true.\\n\\nDavid: Which is true. That is true. All of that is true.\\n\\nBen: But it's half the story.\\n\\nDavid: He was not the only person who dined lavishly at the feast. Microsoft did just as much directly from Xerox, and Charles was one of the main vectors by which this happened.\\n\\nHere is the list of things that were invented or basically invented at Xerox PARC. The graphical user interface, the desktop, the mouse, object-oriented programming, ethernet, laser printing, along with a whole host of other things. This is everything about modern computing, invented there.\\n\\nWho are the people who were at Xerox PARC? There was Alan Kay, there was Bob Metcalfe, who would go on to found 3Com. He invented ethernet, Metcalfe's Law.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, the value of a network scaling proportionally to the square of the number of inputs.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Bob Metcalf, Xerox PARC, Larry Tesler, who would join Apple, John Warnock, who started Adobe, Eric Schmidt worked at Xerox PARC. Everybody was there. It was a lavish picnic.\\n\\nBen: And Charles Simonyi.\\n\\nDavid: And Charles Simonyi. The thing about PARC and the computer that they built there to instantiate all these concepts, which was named the Alto, is it really was a research center. The Alto, go look it up on Wikipedia, go look at pictures. It's the Mac. The Alto is the Mac.\\n\\nBen: It's the Mac with the monitor turned on its side.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, it's a vertical Mac.\\n\\nBen: It's a 3x4 display, not a 4x3 display.\\n\\nDavid: They start making it in 1973. You might be like, wait a minute, what's going on here? The Mac doesn't come out till 1984.\\n\\nBen: 11 years earlier.\\n\\nDavid: How on earth is Xerox making the Mac in the pre 8-bit era, the pre-microprocessor era? It's not a microprocessor. The Alto is not a microprocessor architecture. It's a mini computer. What you see when you look at photos of the Alto is you see the Mac. What you don't see is under the table or behind it is a mini computer.\\n\\nBen: I never realized that.\\n\\nDavid: It is not a personal computer architecture at all. It is a 16-bit, essentially mini computer, that costs tens of thousands of dollars to make each one of them. It's a science project.\\n\\nBen: You should have a little bit more generosity for the East Coast management at Xerox for failing to commercialize this.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. The time was not right. It was not possible. It wasn't even conceived of in the microprocessor architecture, because the microprocessor basically didn't exist when they made it.\\n\\nBen: Interesting.\\n\\nDavid: In 1980, again, this year for Microsoft, same year Microsoft joins, same year they signed the IBM partnership, Charles Simonyi comes up from Xerox PARC. He's of course bringing all this same knowledge, all this same experience that Steve jobs is bringing into Apple. He's bringing all that right into Microsoft too.\\n\\nThe first thing that he gets tasked with is working with this new consumer products division to build application software to compete with VisiCalc and WordStar to compete with spreadsheets and to compete in word processing. He leads the teams that create Word and MultiPlan, Microsoft's first spreadsheet. Remember, we're still at the end of the 8-bit era. The graphical user interface doesn't exist yet other than on the Alto in Xerox PARC.\\n\\nBen: No, these are DOS applications. It's all character mode.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, it is command line interface. The vector that they think they're going to compete, at least in spreadsheets with VisiCalc, is that they're going to be on every platform out there. VisiCalc, I believe, was more or less basically only on the Apple II. That doesn't end up working too well.\\n\\nThe next generation, the IBM PC era, they make the same mistake. The application business stays focused on being on lots of machines, making software that's compatible with everything. A new company pops up called Lotus. Lotus makes the radical decision that they are going to make a spreadsheet only for the IBM PC.\\n\\nThis was genius. This is the 1-2-3 spreadsheet. It goes on to become, at that point in time, the most successful software ever. This is wild. I can't even believe I'm about to say this, and it blew my mind when I found it in research. There are a couple of years in the late eighties, where Lotus has more revenue than Microsoft and is valued higher.\\n\\nBen: Yup. In fact, the year that Microsoft went public, Lotus had more revenue than Microsoft at the IPO.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Wild.\\n\\nBen: it's crazy. Lotus 1-2-3 had some graphics, but it was still in character mode. It was a powerful spreadsheet that could start to do some graphics, even though there wasn't actually a GUI operating system yet, which is interesting. Lotus 1-2-3 was faster, it had bigger spreadsheets, and it was just more powerful. Microsoft Multiplan was still targeting the older 8-bit.\\n\\nMultiplan, despite Microsoft's best efforts, is completely left in the dust. Microsoft's trying to figure out, what should we learn from this? In talking with Pete Higgins and Mike Slade, who were both early leaders in the development and the marketing of the applications division, actually, Mike Slade went on to work directly for Steve Jobs at NeXT and Apple for many years.\\n\\nIn chatting with both of them, what basically became apparent Microsoft learned, with our applications, we should not be targeting the current platforms at all. The lesson to learn is never leave yourself open to the next generation of technology. They're learning the Moore's Law lesson again.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and how it applies to applications. Yes. You always got to target the next platform.\\n\\nBen: Right, even if that platform is not the one you own. That's the interesting thing about when they're evaluating Multiplan and they say, how do we not get Lotus 1-2-3 again, basically, the applications team gets the freedom to look around and say, okay, no matter what our overall company strategy is right now, or no matter what the systems division is doing, what is the most cutting-edge platform that is going to be so interesting to people that we can develop the most envelope-pushing technology for it? That becomes the mandate for applications.\\n\\nDavid: This is the dawn of horizontal software. You can have a whole company or a whole division of a company, in Microsoft's case, that makes this tool. That tool will be so much better than anything that even the largest companies can have their own software developers write. General Electric isn't going to write a better spreadsheet than 1-2-3. I think that the technology complement to this law is the killer app.\\n\\nBen: You have to counter position. If 1-2-3 is the best spreadsheet out there for the current technology generation, you just can't compete with them. You need to wait for the next big leap forward in order to find a new competitive vector.\\n\\nDavid: You need to be the killer app on the next platform, and that's what Lotus 1-2-3 did with the spreadsheet on the IBM PC and IBM compatible PC. That's what Microsoft decides, hey, we got to do this in the graphical interface.\\n\\nBen: Who's about to come out with the very best instantiation of a graphical user interface? Apple computer.\\n\\nDavid: That would be Steve Jobs.\\n\\nBen: Yes. The next chapter of our Microsoft story is the Macintosh in 1984.\\n\\nDavid: It's so fun.\\n\\nBen: Before we do that, this is the perfect time to talk about another one of our favorite companies and longtime Acquired partners who are back, pilot.com. For startups and growth companies of all kinds, Pilot handles all of your company's accounting, tax, and bookkeeping needs, and is in fact now by far the largest startup focused accounting firm in the entire US.\\n\\nDavid: Also, we have to give our good buddy and Pilot CEO, Waseem Daher, a special shout out here because I think he is now the only Acquired sponsor CEO, who is also a source for an episode, because back when Waseem was a student at MIT, he interviewed Bill Gates for the school paper. He dug up the PDF and sent it to us. We're going to link to it in the episode sources.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Very fun. Back to Pilot, and speaking of incredibly successful Seattle business people, we talk all the time on Acquired about Jeff Bezos' AWS-inspired axiom that startups should focus on what makes their beer taste better, i.e. only spend your limited time and resources on what is actually going to move the needle for you, your product, your customers, and outsource everything else that you need to do as a company but doesn't fit that bill.\\n\\nAccounting is example number one of what he's talking about. Every company needs this, but it needs to be done by a professional. You don't want to take any risk of something going wrong. But at the same time, it actually has zero impact on your product or your customers.\\n\\nDavid: So enter Pilot. Pilot both sets up and operates your company's entire financial stack, finance, accounting, tax, even CFO services like investor reporting from your general ledger, all the way up to budgeting and financial sections of your board decks. They've been doing this now for years across thousands of startups in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. There's nobody better who you can trust to both get finance right and make it easy and painless for your company.\\n\\nBen: These are now companies like OpenAI, Airtable, Scale, as well as large ecommerce companies. It's not just that they have the experience across startups, they can also keep working with you as you scale to the growth phase and beyond. If your company wants to go back to focusing on what makes your beer taste better, go on over to pilot.com/acquired and tell them that Ben and David sent you.\\n\\nAll right, David, why are we talking about the Mac?\\n\\nDavid: Because I think it's fair to say that the Mac made Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Office made the Mac. I don't think that it's actually a controversial statement, although it probably sounds crazy to many of you listening.\\n\\nBen: Totally. Far and away the first thing to point out is the first version of Microsoft Excel was for the Mac. It's especially crazy for all the finance people today who are like, oh, Mac Excel isn't real Excel. Excel has to happen on Windows.\\n\\nDavid: No, Excel was on the Mac. That was it.\\n\\nBen: Yes. The logic basically was Microsoft was really coming around to the idea that the next big thing in computing was the graphical user interface. The reason they were coming around to this was because they knew from Xerox PARC just as well as Apple did, and they were rapidly trying to figure out how to get All of that Xerox PARC-iness into their product line, too. That's the other half of this untold Xerox PARC story.\\n\\nOne of the first ways that they see to bring the graphical user interface to their products is launching Excel for the Mac because they basically see, the way that we got destroyed with Lotus 1-2-3, we can't compete with lotus on the IBM PC, so we're going to shelf Multiplan start over, and Excel is going to come out in the graphical user interface. We're going to try to be first and best on the GUI.\\n\\nDavid: One thing just to underscore here, Excel is the world's first graphical spreadsheet program. That's why it wins, and that's why it's so important. Imagine trying to use Excel in the command line interface. That's what VisiCalc was, that's what even 1-2-3 was. Yeah, useful, better than nothing, but graphical charts, cells, visual relationships, this is so important. Excel is where it all starts.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Of course, Apple loves this. The Macintosh came out in 1984, and everybody remembers the great intro video and the hello script. I've watched that Steve Jobs keynote because of course, I have, and it's this magical moment in computing history where finally something that's insanely great comes out. It's the beginning of Steve Jobs' unbelievable presentation prowess. It's so fun to watch it. It's, of course, a product that eventually people really loved. But at first...\\n\\nDavid: It doesn't have the killer app.\\n\\nBen: No, it's a product that was supposed to ship in 1982. It didn't, it shipped in 1984. At the time, what they were targeting for 1982 was a pretty great set of technologies. By 1984, it's an aging set of technologies. It debuts with 128K of memory, which basically isn't enough to create any interesting applications. Developers are ignoring it as an interesting platform to develop on. Within 12 months, they figure it out and come out with a better version that's 512K. That's the version that people now really think about.\\n\\nDavid: That gets re-christened as like, that's the original Mac. The original original is the Mac 128 or something that.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. But in the meantime, Microsoft, the applications group is working their ass off to make something really great for the Macintosh, and they come up with Excel. What ends up happening is Apple's really trying to promote the sales of this machine. They view Excel and PageMaker as the killer apps, as reasons that people should buy this thing, because once you run through a lot of the demo apps and the stuff that Apple built, you're like, okay, what else is here? It's crickets.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Writing hello in script is cool, but like a lot of VR stuff, you're like, oh, that's a cool demo, but you're going to do that every day? No.\\n\\nBen: I'm not sure this has ever been publicly disclosed before, but Apple spent just as much marketing Excel as Microsoft did. They matched Microsoft's marketing spend with their own campaign for it and split the bill.\\n\\nDavid: That's amazing.\\n\\nBen: You've got a couple of concurrent things going on in applications land. You've got Excel coming out for Mac to take advantage of the GUI. This strategy is just all over the place, I think that's an interesting thing to underscore about Microsoft in this era. They're trying a ton of stuff because they're paranoid. They don't want to miss the next wave. Meanwhile, also in the applications group, Charles Simonyi has written Word. This is about a year before in 1983. Microsoft Word comes out for DOS.\\n\\nDavid: Right, and they ship it with a mouse.\\n\\nBen: Yes. This is like, okay, we see the Xerox PARC stuff coming out in the Mac. Great, Excel will be for that. We want to develop Word. We're going to do that for DOS. But I can imagine how useful the mouse is going to be in a word processing environment. They actually ship a mouse tied to the application that's not a part of DOS. This is how early we were in figuring out what the split between applications and platforms were at this point in history. Microsoft thought maybe a mouse makes sense just for this one application, even though it doesn't do anything else for the rest of the command line interface.\\n\\nDavid: It was all being figured out. I think it is also really fair to say that Microsoft was right there with Apple in the Mac development phase. Obviously, they're working on Excel, working on other what would become the Office Suite applications together for Mac.\\n\\nSteve Jobs shows Bill Gates the Mac project in 1981, three years before it ships. Microsoft and Apple signed an agreement to work together on applications for it in 1982. They were very deeply embedded on this, which is going to make the lawsuit and what comes up in a minute here all the more funny.\\n\\nBen: The decision for the Excel team is to focus on GUI. The whole marketing message is Excel on a Mac is better than Lotus 1-2-3 on a PC. You're starting to see truly divergent cultures at Microsoft between the systems group, which is currently making DOS.\\n\\nWe'll soon make Windows, soon partner with IBM, or soon do something else that we're getting into here in the next chapter of the story, and the applications group, which is also currently a bunch of disparate applications and teams targeting disparate platforms, but is also about to become unified in their next chapter. Within the applications group, that next chapter is Microsoft Office.\\n\\nIn 1985, in January, the bundle is released. It was originally called the Business Pack for Microsoft. It started on the Mac.\\n\\nDavid: It really rolls off the tongue.\\n\\nBen: Totally does. They haven't acquired PowerPoint yet or forethought as we talked about eight years ago on Acquired way back in history. There's no PowerPoint, it's not part of the bundle. What you've got here on the Mac and the first version of Office is Word, which they've developed in house, File, Chart, and Multiplan. This first notion of a suite, so today we're very familiar with suite—Creative Suite over at Adobe. Software is sold this way. This was the first time.\\n\\nWhat was actually happening is all of the bundling was happening in pricing, in marketing, and in manufacturing. You had a single box that they would ship with the different applications by 1988 or 1989. It was Word, Excel, PowerPoint. They're very different things, but they're getting bundled together in a way to be sold to customers, but there's no product integration.\\n\\nYou don't have the ability to do this very nice copy-paste from an Excel table and just paste that into Word. That whole idea is pretty far away. In this earliest Microsoft Office, it was just, how can we bundle something for a cheaper price if you buy all three and make marketing easier for us to have this unified message?\\n\\nDavid: Soon to come—and we'll get into Windows here in a second—one of the big killer app for productivity in particular for business productivity with a graphical user interface like Windows and true multitasking, you can get copy-paste from Excel into PowerPoint. Lotus and the world back in the command line interface where you've got these programs running on top of DOS, that is a completely foreign concept.\\n\\nBen: Right, none of those verbs exist.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. We've now set the stage of Microsoft's doing a lot of stuff. They're hedging a lot of bets, they're not totally sure which strategy is going to win out, they're not sure which platform is going to win out. They're not sure if they're more of a systems company or an application company, but what they are unified on is we make great software for personal computers. I think anything that fell into that purview, they were willing to explore.\\n\\nThey didn't really have hard boundaries between, we'll do anything to make our operating systems great, or we'll do anything to advantage our applications. Even we think we're an enterprise company, we think we're a consumer company. They just didn't have well formed opinions yet. It was just we make software for personal computers.\\n\\nDavid: At this point in time, the actual boundary between an operating system and an application is very fluid.\\n\\nBen: You've got a mouse that works for one program.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Lotus would really go down a dead end evolutionary path with Notes later in its life and its final chapter, where the application was going to be the operating system.\\n\\nBen: Right. Lotus Notes was crazy. It was a word processor, an email service, and it was a platform on which you could write other applications.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and it itself was an application.\\n\\nBen: It's crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Not an operating system. It was all dynamic. Speaking of though, Microsoft here is in bed with Apple, working on the Mac. Bill and the company are big believers in the future of the graphical user interface. Starting in 1983, they're like, we got to do our own graphical operating system or at least user interface. This is the origins of the Windows product. They actually announced it in November, 1983, before the Mac ends up shipping, which their partner, Apple, is of course not happy about.\\n\\nJust development of the Mac was rocky, development of Windows was super freaking rocky within Microsoft, too. This is around that same time when Paul Allen gets Hodgkin's disease and leaves the company. His presence as great technical leader is very much missed, but they bring in someone from Xerox to manage the development of Windows.\\n\\nThat person ends up not working out, he gets fired. Steve Ballmer gets drafted to come in and be the dev manager for the final push to release Windows 1.0, which is hilarious. You can find amazing YouTube videos from the launch and all joking about how non technical Steve coming in to Save the day and dev manage windows to launch.\\n\\nBen: Which is so funny. I don't think at this point in history, the lines were clearly formed among the executives yet. Steve wasn't running the global sales force, and Microsoft wasn't an enterprise company.\\n\\nDavid: No, we're going to get to that later.\\n\\nBen: Steve was one of the smart executives, they were a software company, and someone had to manage getting the software out the door. Windows 1.0 comes out. It's bad.\\n\\nDavid: It's bad. November 1985, Windows 1.0 is a very, very different thing than you imagine a graphical user interface is today or what you know of as Windows. It was tiled. It was not overlapping Windows that you can drag around and have one over the other. When you opened a program in Windows 1.0, the system created a literal window of it on your screen, and then it dynamically resized the windows as you open other applications. Nothing could ever be on top of each other. As you open more and more stuff, the windows get smaller and smaller and smaller. It's very bizarre.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. The idea of windows overlapping on top of each other, that was a uniquely Mac thing and a thing that smart engineers at Apple figured out how to do that in a performant way that offers good user experience. I would classify Windows 1.0 as a half step between command line and an actual graphical user interface.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, 100%. I believe Microsoft and Apple actually did a licensing agreement while they were working together during this time that said, hey, Microsoft can use a lot of the stuff that's being developed for Mac for Windows 1.0.\\n\\nBen: Yes, that's right. Apple does do a deal to license a lot of \\\"their intellectual property\\\" which of course came from Xerox, to Microsoft. Apple, I think, was under the impression that it was just for Windows 1.0, but the actual terms of the agreement are this and all future versions of Windows, which comes back to haunt Apple later. But yes, they totally get the license.\\n\\nDavid: Also, by the time that this agreement actually happens, I think Steve Jobs has been ousted, so it's Scully who does this agreement. People in Apple would look back on this for years and be like, this was a huge error.\\n\\nThe other important thing about Windows during this awkward teenage phase is it's not an operating system. It's just a graphical interface on top of DOS.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: The original name for Windows was Interface Manager.\\n\\nBen: Isn't it crazy? In all of their early marketing, they referred to it as Windows, a graphical operating environment that runs on the Microsoft MS-DOS operating system. Actually, it was not until Windows 95 that Windows was its own operating system. It was in Windows 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups. It was a graphical operating environment.\\n\\nHere's the question. Why is Microsoft doing Windows? Obviously here, Microsoft knows they need to evolve DOS. They need to figure something out for the graphical world. David, are you telling me that Windows is the widely agreed upon future of the company and that's just a straight line?\\n\\nDavid: Obviously that's a setup there. Here's the other thing that's happening in the company at this time, and it's the bigger thing. It's the next phase of the IBM relationship. Windows, the Mac, all of this, are hedges for the company. Microsoft and Bill, in particular, were masters of hedging their bets in an uncertain technology future.\\n\\nHe was so great. The company was so great at making sure that whichever way the apple fell from the tree, as Jetson Huang put it to us in our interview, Microsoft was going to be positioned to catch it. A lot of people, including Bill and Microsoft themselves, believe that the way that apple was going to fall from the tree here was IBM and OS/2.\\n\\nBen: The IBM PC was such a big deal last time around. You would think that whatever IBM wants to do next is a pretty good way to ally yourself.\\n\\nDavid: What's going on here? IBM, obviously the PC was a huge success, but losing dominance of the ecosystem to the clones, this was bad. IBM wants to find a way to evolve the PC ecosystem back to being more IBM proprietary. They're going to make Microsoft come along for the ride here.\\n\\nThe way that they're going to do this is with the next generation of the PC ecosystem, they are going to make a whole new modern operating system. They're going to get rid of DOS. They're going to make this operating system in partnership with Microsoft, and it's going to be called, fittingly, OS/2. They are going to lock Microsoft up that they can't license it to anybody else. OS/2 is going to be proprietary to IBM hardware, just like the Mac operating system is proprietary to Apple hardware.\\n\\nAs powerful as Microsoft's become here, they're still the little brother to IBM. This is not great news for Microsoft. On the other hand, it's much better for them to be on the inside here with IBM working in bed with them than it would be to be on the outside looking in if IBM's vision comes true and they recapture control of the PC ecosystem.\\n\\nBill, Microsoft, the company, and Steve too as the manager of the account with IBM, commit themselves to Microsoft is all in on this vision of the future of OS/2, and IBM is our horse in the race.\\n\\nBen: This is such a crazy part of the story to me, because we just talked about how Microsoft discovered this amazing business model. With everyone needing to license DOS from them, they're taking over the world, and they're becoming the standard development platform. Why on earth, if all that is true, are they going to develop some software that's going to be locked to IBM computers?\\n\\nDavid: This is a recentralization attempt. Ballmer has this great, great, great quote about it. He says, \\\"This,” the IBM partnership at this time, “was what we used to call riding the bear. You just had to try to stay on the bear's back and the bear would twist, turn, and try to throw you off. But we were going to stay on the bear because the bear was the biggest, the most important. You just had to be with the bear. Otherwise, you would be under the bear.\\\" That was IBM at this point in time.\\n\\nReally, I think it was IBM essentially putting a gun to Microsoft's head and being like, well, you can be in bed with us on this future that we're going to re-centralize everything, or you can be everybody else and not be, and you'll lose.\\n\\nBen: Even though Microsoft's doing all these little hedges, Windows, this tiny little team that's 30 people or something, it's not the most prestigious place at the company. The people in the applications division may as well be on another planet by this point from the systems division. They're trying all kinds of crazy stuff. The company motto at this point is the next big thing is OS/2 and IBM, and we are the software vendor for that.\\n\\nDavid: Certainly Bill and I think Steve, too, they needed to tow the party line politically of expressing that, nope, OS/2 is the future. What we're doing with Windows and with the Mac is those are small things within the company. It's a super bizarre period in history, but IBM had also made a bit of a power play too with the later generations of the 16-bit era product they called the PC/AT. They used the Intel 286 chip instead of the Intel 386 chip. The 286 chip—this was an intentional decision on IBM's part—was good, but it wasn't great.\\n\\nBen: You say it was good, but not great. Bill Gates said it was brain dead.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Bill Gates called it a brain-dead chip.\\n\\nBen: I think you might be being charitable.\\n\\nDavid: I think it certainly was more powerful than the 8086, 8088, but it was nowhere near what the 386 could do. There's a bunch of technical aspects to this, but the most important takeaway is that the 286 was not really powerful enough to do a graphical user interface or to power true multitasking in a way that the 386 and then later the 486 would be.\\n\\nA big part of actually the Compaq story about how Compaq and the clones leap ahead of IBM is they're not deterred from coming out with 386 machines, which are way more powerful, can run Windows, can do all this stuff. That's how they start to separate from IBM.\\n\\nBen: That's right. That was a bet that company move where Microsoft was like, hey, Compaq, go make 386 stuff because we're going to make a really great 386 software. We need someone to be all in on that because IBM's not.\\n\\nDavid: This is the thing. Bill, Steve, and the company, they're having to tow the party line of expressing commitment to IBM, but really they're like, no, Compaq, go do the 386, we're going to do Windows.\\n\\nBen: Right, they're riling up the rebels.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. They are the rebels versus the empire here. Anyway, IBM, of course, sees all this. They made the decision not to go to 386 and to discourage it in the marketplace because they didn't want PCs to start creeping into the core enterprise mainframe IBM workloads, their core business. If that was going to happen, they wanted it to be IBM proprietary closed system. I think that was a big part of the impetus for this OS/2 initiative.\\n\\nBen: I see.\\n\\nDavid: This is the empire strikes back here.\\n\\nBen: They're basically trying to coop the PC movement back into IBM proprietary land.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. When OS/2 finally does come out in December 1987, predictably, as you can imagine here, it's not very good. The market does not like it. Thank God for Microsoft. Again, this probably was Bill's strategy all along that they hedged with Windows, with the Mac. That's clearly the future. The market is not going to accept OS/2 and a recentralization on IBM. Microsoft's just crushing it on the revenue side, even though OS/2 is a failure.\\n\\nBen: DOS and the applications were both great businesses by 1987.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Fiscal 1987, Microsoft does $350 million in revenue. Fiscal 1988, they do $600 million in revenue. Basically, none of this is from OS/2 and the IBM world. Towards the end of 1988 is when the wind starts really blowing away from IBM here.\\n\\nIn June of 1988, Microsoft hires Mike Maples, who is IBM's director of software strategy away from IBM to come head Microsoft's application software. What is Microsoft's application software strategy right now? It's the graphical user interface. It's everything that IBM isn't. The writing is starting to be on the wall here that divorce is coming between IBM and Microsoft.\\n\\nFinally, a year-and-a-half later in 1990, Windows 3.0 comes out. This is when they get it right. This is when there's enough installed base of 386 and 486 machines out there in the open PC ecosystem that you can have a really good, true multitasking, good UI, graphical user interface running on top of DOS.\\n\\nWindows 1.0 and Windows 2.0 only ever achieved 5% penetration of the DOS installed base. Windows 3.0 doubles that in the first six months. PC Computing magazine writes about Windows 3.0. May 22nd, 1990 will mark the first day of the second era of IBM compatible PCs. Microsoft released Windows 3.0.\\n\\nOn that day, the IBM compatible PC, a machine hobbled by an outmoded character-based operating system and 70s style programs, was transformed into a computer that could soar in a decade of multitasking graphical operating environments, aka everything OS/2 is not. Windows 3.0 gets right what its predecessors got wrong. It drives adequate performance, it accommodates existing DOS applications, and it makes you believe that it belongs on a PC.\\n\\nBen: That's awesome.\\n\\nDavid: That's what the press thought. Ben, I know you talked to a really important person in the Windows ecosystem and Microsoft internally at this time. What do you have for us?\\n\\nBen: We have to thank Brad Silverberg for helping us with this section. Brad led the Windows 3.1 team. He came in right after the 3.0 release and would eventually go on to lead the Windows 95 effort as the VP of the Personal Systems Division.\\n\\nBrad comes in, Windows 3.0 has just shipped. The first thing that is super, super obvious is as Brad observed everything going on with OS/2 land and everything going on with the core Microsoft culture, it was a complete clash. It was impossible for the pace of Microsoft. This is a super young group, all in their 20s. Some people in their 30s, but mostly 20s who just want to push the cutting edge, ship stuff.\\n\\nThink about Google in the early 2000s, just hire all the smartest people you can, set them loose, have creativity, and bump up against the edge of what's possible, both in terms of pushing the hardware, but also pushing even laws as we would later see. Let's just do what users love and see what happens. Let's just do what technology enables us to do and see what happens. That's the opposite of IBM's culture at this point. There's this huge cultural rift between what IBM needs and who Microsoft is at this point.\\n\\nWhat ended up happening with 3.0, it was unexpectedly loved. Microsoft was not really prepared for how much people were going to love the GUI, and with 3.1 it got really good. There was a small off site of the executives, and Bill and Steve basically decided that it was time to bet on Windows. That was the new strategy. Windows had always been plan B, and now suddenly it was plan A.\\n\\nWhen I say plan B, I don't mean thought they had a prayer of being plan A. It was 65 people that shipped windows 3.1. These were the misfits. It was not prestigious. The prestigious thing to work on at Microsoft was OS/2 and eventually Windows NT. But the Windows team in the Windows 3.0 era is almost the Mac team over at Apple. They were flying the rebel flag, they valued creativity over bureaucracy, even if it meant they weren't working on the prestigious thing.\\n\\nSuddenly, there's this huge strategic opportunity to become the standard independent of IBM if the platform is good enough, and then boom. The early reception to Windows is so good, it gives this glimmer of, that may seem really ambitious, but that opportunity is actually ours if we want to go seize it. Everyone took a big gulp and said, the GUI's the next big thing, users love this, let's take the ragtag group and promote them.\\n\\nDavid: This was, I think, the moment when Microsoft started to believe in themselves, really. If you look at the facts as we told the story, it was like, Bill did this great business deal with IBM, anticipated the rise of the clones in the first PC, won, and then Microsoft now was the thing, and IBM was the old thing. It wasn't until this. In this whole OS/2 thing, I think you can see, they felt like they were still little brother. They had to go along with what IBM dictated. Now they're like, whoa.\\n\\nBen: Why do we again?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, we're in control.\\n\\nBen: The press is making a big deal out of Bill Gates. Boy Wonder, he's the youngest ever billionaire at age 31. By the way, when Bill Gates became a billionaire, there were not lots of billionaires, there were 50 billionaires. All this lore around the company, it's like they can do no wrong. But inside the company, I think they're like, we don't know the future of technology. Any wave could break against us at any moment, and this is all tenuous. I think that chasm kept getting wider and wider and wider of internally feeling like they're screwed and externally it's seeming this is the next great thing.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I've got some fun stats on money and revenue around all this. In fiscal 1990, the year that Windows 3.0 shipped, Microsoft does $1.2 billion in revenue, making them the first software company ever to pass a billion dollars in revenue. Fiscal 1991, they do $1.8 billion. Fiscal 1992, they finally win the Apple copyright lawsuit around the GUI.\\n\\nBen: By the way, the way that they won that, a judge basically looked at the paper and said, Apple, you totally said in all the future versions of Windows, they can use your UI paradigms. For most of the counts, they're covered. For these other things that you're trying to ask them about, those are not actually defensible. It's just widely accepted that these are UI paradigms now, and you can't enforce any ownership over those. It basically got thrown out. Apple tried to appeal all the way up to the Supreme Court, who said no.\\n\\nDavid: That's right. Like we've been saying too, they both stole from Xerox.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Fiscal 1992 though, this is when Microsoft just blows the doors off. They do $2.8 billion in revenue in fiscal 1992, up from $1.8 the year before. That year, 1992 in October is when Gates finally passes John Kluge—Acquired OG fans, back to the LVMH episode—Gates passes John Kluge of Metromedia fame, media mogul to become the wealthiest person in America. Everything you're talking about, all the press comes around that.\\n\\nIn January 1993, the crowning moment happens. Microsoft passes IBM in market cap. They have inherited the earth. They have inherited computing. Supposedly. I don't know if this is 100% true. This is written in one of the books I read. I read this. The folks involved will have to confirm or deny.\\n\\nSupposedly, the next month after Microsoft passes IBM in market cap—we're now in February 1993—the IBM board is in disarray. The empire is going down. They fired the CEO. Tom Murphy of Capital Cities fame who is on the IBM board, supposedly comes out to Redmond to sit down with Bill and personally ask him to come and be the next CEO of IBM.\\n\\nBen: No way.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This is what I read. I don't know if this actually happened, but this is what I read.\\n\\nBen: Is that in Hard Drive?\\n\\nDavid: That's in Hard Drive, yeah.\\n\\nBen: Wow. Listeners, there are some unauthorized biographies that we tried to corroborate as many of the facts as we can. But the ones where David's saying he doesn't know a source, it's these unauthorized ones.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Gates obviously declines that. Whether or not that actually happened, spiritually, you could believe that happened. Bill and Microsoft are the new emperor here. This carries through to this day. We're going to tell in the next episode here, the antitrust, the fall, and all that, but not really. Microsoft's still the most valuable company in the world. They inherited the throne from IBM. It happens right here.\\n\\nBen: It's nuts. Suddenly, Microsoft feels the full weight of everything that you have to do to build a platform and be a steward of an ecosystem. Suddenly, this huge effort began to try and make developers successful. That's how Windows would be successful if it was a great platform for application developers to thrive on.\\n\\nCameron Myhrvold led the developer relations group basically to try and figure out, what do people want out of a platform, and how do we provide the APIs for them, the support, and everything in order to do that, all the documentation, all the help, everything? At the same time, Microsoft basically knew establishing a platform is brutal and requires bootstrapping a multi sided network of developers, users, and PC manufacturers.\\n\\nSo 3.1 had users excited, but it was still very early. They could have lost that throne. Developers were not really yet targeting Windows. Microsoft had to show, we make great applications for Windows, too. The applications group really had to start doing Windows 3.1.\\n\\nDavid: Right, because developers were targeting DOS at this point. They were probably preparing for OS/2. Some of them were targeting the Mac, Microsoft itself, but nobody was targeting Windows.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. You've got this big developer relations group effort that spins up. Meanwhile, there's a huge push with OEMs to get them to install Windows. At this point, they were still installing DOS or some people were actually installing nothing and requiring users to put operating systems on. There's a conceded push to get the OEMs to install 3.1.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and there are some people installing nothing. We should mention here, around this same time, this era, they move a lot of their OEM deals to a per processor licensing fee arrangement, which gets them in a lot of hot water with antitrust a few years later.\\n\\nBen: Okay, this happened from 1988 to 1994. David, explain the per processor licensing agreement.\\n\\nDavid: Here's how Microsoft (I think) would position it to their OEM partners. You could pay us a license fee for every machine you ship with DOS installed on it, or DOS and Windows. You can offer other OSes too. But rather than that arrangement, we'll give you a cheaper per unit deal because you're going to ship DOS on everything. DOS is the standard, and we want Windows to be the standard, and Windows is going to be the standard.\\n\\nWe'll make it more economically attractive to you, give you a lower per unit rate. If we just change the terms and say, instead of every unit you ship with, DOS or with Windows, every machine you ship, period, every microprocessor based machine that you ship, no matter what operating system is installed on us, just pay us a per processor rate. If you do that, you'll be paying us for every machine, whether you ship DOS or Windows on it or not, but you're going to ship DOS and Windows anyway.\\n\\nBen: You may as well take the cheaper rate.\\n\\nDavid: You may as well take the cheaper option. Obviously, what effect does this have on competition? There's now a very, very, very strong incentive never to ship any other operating system.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Basically, you're going to pay for two different operating systems, even though you're only putting one on if you ever load a different operating system on. Yes, it very strongly incentivizes you to never ever ever ship any other operating systems on your computers as a company.\\n\\nThis is of course the way that regulators would look at it in 1994. That would get Microsoft in some hot water, and they had to agree to stop doing this practice. The way Microsoft would look at it is, we're just helping our customers. Do you really think that these companies want to keep a whole separate ledger of what machines they shipped DOS on or Windows on versus what machines they shipped period? Wouldn't it just be easier if once a month or once a quarter, they could just report to us their total shipments like they have to report to their investors anyway, and then we'll just send them an invoice for all their machines?\\n\\nDavid: Totally. While antitrust and the government would seize onto this as a smoking gun, I think the reality is this was irrelevant in terms of the forces that made DOS and Windows the winners. They were already the winners by the time they started doing this.\\n\\nBen: If this had happened earlier, you could see how this would be more of a compelling way to get market share. But by the time they started doing it, they were already running away with the market.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Speaking of this new customer-friendly, buyer-friendly business practice from Microsoft, which I think is how they thought about it...\\n\\nBen: Totally. They wanted to make the stuff that people wanted to use the most, and that's how they would win. Their goal was make the very best products, the best software we possibly can in the ways that people want to use and buy software, and then we'll make a bunch of money.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. As this changing of the guard is happening from IBM to Microsoft, I think part of this new self confidence from Microsoft is, wait a minute, why can't we go win the enterprise too and take that from IBM? We don't have to get in bed with them to sell to the enterprise. We should sell to the enterprise.\\n\\nBen: The thing they were realizing is, well, we have made software that people like to use, so they're using it in businesses. They always wanted that to be the goal, but now it was happening. People are doing their work in Excel. People are bringing PCs to the office.\\n\\nMaybe businesses are buying their PCs, but people are actually buying them themselves and using them in the office. It just made them that much more efficient. Microsoft really had to figure out how to sell to businesses, but we actually have no idea how to do that. It sounds crazy today. The Microsoft you know today, as late as the mid-90s, really had no idea how to sell or build software for businesses.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. This is the first half of the original Microsoft vision statement coming true, a PC on every desk and in every home. Desk means work, means enterprise. In this era, everybody we talk to, gives 100% of the credit to Steve Ballmer.\\n\\nSteve took it on his shoulders at this point in time when Microsoft is passing IBM to say, I am going to build, and we are going to learn as a company how to sell to enterprises. Ben, like you're saying, it's impossible to imagine now Microsoft not like this, but there's so much that they needed to do that they didn't have.\\n\\nBen: In part because prior to this, personal computers were not used by enterprises. It was just not an enterprise tool. Now that it was happening, Microsoft had to figure out how to be the ones that would benefit from it.\\n\\nDavid: That meant selling to the C-suite at global Fortune 500 companies, most of whom did not use computers.\\n\\nBen: Correct. Certainly, it didn't want to buy operating systems one at a time.\\n\\nDavid: Right. To the extent, members of the C-suite like CIOs or proto IT organizations used computers or were the computing centers in the company, they hated the PC. It made their life hard. This was when employees would bring a PC to work, plop it down on their desk, and start mucking around with stuff. It made things hard.\\n\\nBen: And there really isn't yet a business server that couples nicely with the PC on the desk. You have this weird thing where there's a mainframe that is where the company's real enterprise applications run, but people are bringing PCs. Those PCs don't actually communicate well with anything else yet. They just are there for the employee to do their own work on a spreadsheet or something, print it out because finally 3.1 had printer drivers, and then deliver that. But it wasn't a system that operated with other systems in your enterprise.\\n\\nDavid: There's no email. This really was a business transformation task for the global Fortune 500.\\n\\nBen: It wasn't like, hey, let's sell something to businesses that they want to buy. It's, hey, let's convince businesses that PCs are a good idea for their workforce to adopt.\\n\\nDavid: This was partnering with the consulting firms. This was building a direct sales force within Microsoft. This is building an indirect sales force within Microsoft to partner with distribution partners, with channel partners, with independent software vendors. This is building a customer service organization. This is building the executive briefing center on the Microsoft campus, and bringing CEOs and other C-suite folks there to Microsoft. It's building solutions for them, it's becoming a partner. It's everything that Steve is frankly just born to do.\\n\\nBen: All of this stuff is pretty out of scope for this episode, including all the software systems you would need to build for the enterprise like Windows NT server, Exchange, SQL server, and Active Directory, the classic mid-2000s Microsoft stuff that they got known for. That is what this would all evolve into, and it really just started with everyone looking at Steve and saying, can you figure this out?\\n\\nWe've all to date basically just been either running dev teams, running marketing, or running product groups, and been selling through retail or distributors in the application side or mostly through OEMs on the systems and operating system side. But can you go figure out how to sell everything we make in a completely different way to a completely different buyer profile and keep us posted on how that needs to change all the products we make in order to do that? That's a pretty crazy change.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. How it actually goes down, and we heard this from Steve and you heard it from other people, is so fitting. By the end of 1990, the Microsoft-IBM divorce is official. IBM takes full control of OS/2 development back from Microsoft. Microsoft ceases involvement. The breakup is official. This now gives Microsoft and Steve hunting license in the enterprise to go compete against IBM, but they have a secret weapon that is going to enable them to come take the enterprise from IBM. Ben, tell us what it is.\\n\\nBen: It's painfully obvious. It's Microsoft Office, and it's the fact that the whole workforce is already using Microsoft Office. Everyone loves to talk about product-led growth and how it's this new thing in the late 2010s, how Slack, Atlassian, Trello, and everyone figured out PLG. This bottoms-up workforce-adopted way, rather than selling to procurement, IT, or the central administrator. And it's just not new.\\n\\nDavid: No. This has always been the case, and Microsoft invented it.\\n\\nBen: All the employees wanted to use Excel and Word. They were doing it anyway. At some point Microsoft needed to figure out how to take advantage of selling it centrally and how you do business with other businesses, rather than selling a zillion retail copies of people who are using it illegally for their work.\\n\\nDavid: There's so many things that are beautiful about this. It's the legacy of this bet on the Mac, bet on Excel, and bet on Windows shortly thereafter, that enables Microsoft to go into the enterprise because even though they've just broken up with IBM and OS/2 isn't going anywhere, it's not like Steve can just go knock on the door of some banking CEO or C suite and be like, I'm Microsoft, come talk to me about how you're going to use Microsoft products in your organization. But rather it's like, hey, thousands of people in your organization are already using Excel. Let's have a conversation about how we can make that work better for your organization, and what else Microsoft can do for you.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely. Next episode is going to be all about the enormous success of becoming an enterprise company, the enterprise agreement, cloud, and everything that came after that. But we have two chapters left in this episode, and they happen concurrently within the systems group by two very, very different teams, and that is Windows 95 and Windows NT.\\n\\nDavid, let's start with NT, and then our little cherry on top can be 95 to close us out. How did Windows NT happen?\\n\\nDavid: Perfect, and it's intertwined with the beginning of all this enterprisification of Microsoft. Okay, Windows NT. Remember, IBM's whole goal with OS/2 was that they saw the trajectory of the PC was going to eat into traditional mainframe type applications in the enterprise. They wanted to recentralize and own the PC enterprisification of workloads. NT is, after the divorce, Microsoft being like, screw that we're going to do the same thing and eat your lunch.\\n\\nThe initial work starts out of the work they had been doing on OS/2 with IBM. But then in October 1988, as they're heading towards divorce, Microsoft hires Dave Cutler away from DEC. Dave is an absolute beast and legend. He's still writing code at Microsoft today, which is amazing.\\n\\nBen: Isn't that crazy? He's in his 80s.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing. Dave at DEC wrote the whole operating system that DEC ran on VAX. Poaching him away to come work at Microsoft, he's the guy that's going to build an enterprise-ready, take share away from the way traditional enterprise computing is done onto the PC. He's got the chops to do this, he's also got the credibility to do this.\\n\\nBen: He's written a widely-deployed enterprise operating system.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Him coming to Microsoft, him leading and building this effort, gives Steve and the sales force so much legitimacy when they're going in and talking to the C-suites, the CIOs, the IT departments, and enterprises.\\n\\nBen: Even though they don't yet have an enterprise product to sell, they've got DOS and early Windows, which is essentially consumer-targeted, but now they've got this guy, Dave.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, now they've got Dave.\\n\\nBen: We should say, this is really the first time they brought in someone who had real industry experience. In 1988, Microsoft was 13 years old, so Bill Gates would have been 33. Everyone is in their late 20s and early 30s, and Dave's mid-40s. He's like, you know I've seen a few things.\\n\\nDavid: I think it was Dave and also Mike Maples coming from IBM too. Mike obviously wasn't a technical leader but on the business and strategy side, too. NT, we'll talk a lot more about it on the next episode. But spoiler alert, it is the vision of what IBM wanted OS/2 to be, but it's Microsoft's version of it.\\n\\nBen: It enables all of your desktop computers at the company to join and network together in a compliant way. It enables an internal server that everything communicates with. It enables a directory of all the devices on the network and all the people in your organization.\\n\\nDavid: Soon with the Internet coming, it'll enable servers that face externally from your company. The punchline here is that NT becomes the seeds of Windows Server, the business line, which become the seeds of Azure today.\\n\\nBen: The other important takeaway on NT is it was going to take a long time to build. It was going to take a long time to test. It was going to take a long time to sell and deploy, and it was going to have really strict requirements for what it could work on because it's a power hungry operating system built for enterprise IT administrators. That is not your short-term product strategy. That is a long-term bet that a team is going to work on concurrently while you're figuring out what to do after Windows 3.1.\\n\\nIn 1991, Bill Gates sums this up in a memo where he says, “Our strategy is Windows. One evolving architecture, a couple of implementations, and an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others.” Every word in that sentence does a bunch of heavy lifting.\\n\\nYou got one architecture. Okay. I think what that basically ends up meaning a few years later is one application programming interface (API) that developers can target so that when they want to write a Windows app, it works on both NT and whatever the evolution of 3.1 is. That's one architecture, but it says one evolving architecture. That buys Microsoft a little bit more fluidity in the one architecture that's being targeted.\\n\\nThen you hear a couple of implementations. This basically says, even though developers are targeting what became the Win32 API, the one way that we write applications, there are two different implementations. For many years, they would display very differently on NT systems versus—spoiler alert—Windows 95, the successor to Windows 3.1.\\n\\nDavid: By Windows 95, you mean Windows 4 that was supposed to ship in 1993?\\n\\nBen: Yes, I do, but it's so much sexier to say Windows 95 and name it after the year that it actually ships. Yes, an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others sheds light on the DRG (Developer Relations Group) strategy. We got to go out and be massive evangelists, and everyone in the systems group is looking over at the apps group going, did you see that? Bill Gates just said our strategy is Windows. We're now the Windows company, and that includes great applications from Microsoft and others.\\n\\nWhat does that mean, applications group? Let's go first and best on Windows, get to it. I just think that sentence says it all for what we're looking at 1991 through call it 2000 or so.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. We just spent a bunch of time talking about the enterprisification and all the amazing enterprise stuff that the seeds get sewn from Microsoft at this point in time. This era is also the heyday of the consumer PC. In 1993, Jensen starts NVIDIA, graphics cards are becoming a thing. PC gaming is becoming an industry. You can even look at Minesweeper as being a seminal moment in terms of the consumerization, these devices, these personal computers becoming companions to people's lives like the phone is today. You've got CD-ROM technology, multimedia, Encarta. The heyday of the consumer PC is here in this era.\\n\\nBen: Totally. Even before Windows 95 shipped, they had 75 million Windows users. This is even before you get plug-and-play, multimedia, or networking. This is on Windows 3.1. Crazy.\\n\\nWe've been leading up to what we've been building hype, Windows 95, or should I say Chicago? The Chicago name, for those of you out there who were paying attention when this was under development, and you were all excited about what Windows 95 would become—and it's probably 1% of our audience or something who knows the Chicago code name—they wanted to create an OS for the everyman, one that was easy to get to, a nice quality of life when you're there, it was affordable. Chicago is the perfect name in every way. It is also a contrast to what was going on in a different part of Microsoft, where there was the codename of Cairo for a very ambitious next generation operating system.\\n\\nMind you, NT had already come out in 1993. Cairo is this general bucket of maybe it's post-NT, maybe it's part of NT, but this is a really sophisticated, crazy set of technologies that we're going to eventually bake into an operating system. It doesn't really have a release date. No one really believes in any of the release dates that are proposed.\\n\\nThe Windows 95 team, the Windows 4 team, the Chicago team, loved contrasting this idea of a far flung land that's really ambitious. Who knows what it'll actually be like? Chicago is something we know quite well. You get on I-90 from Seattle, you drive for three days, and you're there. That is the goal. That's the spiritual thing about Windows 95.\\n\\nDavid: Pizza, the bears, the cubs.\\n\\nBen: 100%. We should say, Cairo never shipped, so there's a lesson in that.\\n\\nDavid: Might as well been called Oz.\\n\\nBen: Or Longhorn.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Okay, all right, we're getting ahead of ourselves.\\n\\nBen: We are getting ahead of ourselves. Windows 95, let's start with the launch event itself. It was a huge, ridiculous, insane day in Redmond, Washington. They set up tents all over Microsoft's campus. They flew in journalists, beta testers. There was a movement around Windows 95 in a way that you would not believe. It was an operating system launch, and Jay Leno launched it. It wasn't like Jay Leno did some stand up, it was Jay Leno for 90 minutes in a tightly scripted environment, co-hosted with Bill Gates all of the fanfare and festivities.\\n\\nDavid: There is no other word to describe the Windows 95 launch besides glorious. I am so glad that this stuff is preserved on the Internet and on YouTube, and that we could experience it ourselves over the past month.\\n\\nBen: It might be the peak moment of pure joy to celebrate technology before a lot of the skepticism came in and the tech haters.\\n\\nDavid: The DOJ.\\n\\nBen: Totally. It was unabashed celebration of software is probably the best way to put it. Microsoft license Start Me Up famously from the Rolling Stones.\\n\\nDavid: It's amazing, a software company licensed Start Me Up by the Rolling Stones as the official theme song of an operating system. The idea that this would be happening, certainly back in 1975 when they were moving to Albuquerque, but even just a couple of years earlier, this is breaking new ground.\\n\\nBen: Totally. The other thing that's happening in 1995 is the Internet hype is starting to build, but we will table that for next episode. Right at this point in history, only 14% of Americans had internet access. It was still very early, so there was no guarantee that any story posted online would actually reach the masses. Microsoft had really relied on traditional broadcast coverage of this event, and brought in all these journalists, all these print magazines, and all these newspapers to build the hype.\\n\\nI watched the whole keynote yesterday. At the end, they ripped down the back of the tent behind the stage. There's the entire development team in the red, yellow, green, and blue squares of the Windows logo sitting outside on the big sports field on Redmond's campus. There's only 360 people that built Windows 95, so it's still a small team, but they're all there. They're fired up. They're part of the moment. That's the launch event in Redmond, at least.\\n\\nAround the world, people are lined up around the block to buy an operating system. There's a lot of news coverage of that. It was basically the iPhone launch of its day. They lit up the CN Tower, the Tower of London. This date, August 24th, 1995, they basically treated an operating system launch the way that you would launch a movie or a new Madonna album. It was a marketing case study, so much so that the folks from Coca-Cola actually reached out to Microsoft to ask them, how do you do marketing this well in the new age?\\n\\nDavid: To the Bill Gates quote with the Warren Buffett talk at U-Dub.\\n\\nBen: Yes. This is a company that freaking invented Santa Claus to sell us all sugar water, and they're calling Microsoft asking, how do you market in this new era? It was that successful. They launched concurrently worldwide in eight languages. This thread that Microsoft had of early international continued all the way through to this moment. They invested heavily in doing all of the localization and help stuff so that the whole world really could adopt something all at one time. It really was the perfect product at the right time, the Internet, games, all of that.\\n\\nDavid: There's so much about Windows 95 too that I'm sure you're going to get into, but the start menu. It was so perfect because this was the peak of the PC going fully mainstream. Nobody had ever treated software like this before.\\n\\nBen: That's the takeaway. They thought about software in a completely different way. Yes, the start menu, while it got cluttered, complicated, and messed up over time, the idea of a button that you click to start using your computer was very appealing to people.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. The Mac obviously shared a lot of these elements, but it was at so much a smaller scale.\\n\\nBen: The Mac just never had any real PC penetration. From the IBM PC forward, it never had big market share.\\n\\nDavid: This was your grandmother coming into the digital world.\\n\\nBen: That is how they tried to market it. They market it as people on job sites using Windows. They marketed it as people doing crafts. There's someone who's modeling something for an F1 car. It's just fun watching all these old videos and seeing all the different personas.\\n\\nDavid: Computer companies love F1 cars for demos. It's the ultimate aspirational demo.\\n\\nBen: I must say this all pains me deeply as someone who never owned a PC, grew up using a Mac, loved every bit of my Mac. I was even an apologist in the OS-9 era of this isn't very good, but I'm still going to say it's good. I was on the OS-10 public beta. I only clicked a start menu when I was fixing a teacher's computer at school. Even though the takeaway here is everyone thought this was a great operating system and it won the market, I always looked at it like, well, it's not a Mac.\\n\\nDavid: That's how Mac users always look at Windows.\\n\\nBen: The way that Apple products became mainstream always felt odd to me as someone who was using them when they weren't, but it's been interesting gaining a new appreciation for Microsoft through studying their history that I absolutely did not have as a user during this era.\\n\\nDavid: Having this discussion now makes me think, Windows 95, they did what Apple tried to do in bringing Scully in. Scully came from Pepsi. Obviously, that didn't work, but Microsoft, they're the ones who did it. They're the ones who mass-marketified the computing vision.\\n\\nBen: It was the wrong strategy for Apple, and it was the right strategy for Microsoft. Apple has always, at least in my opinion, created a better computing experience by being completely integrated. It's the Alan Kay quote, \\\"Anyone who cares about making great software needs to build their own hardware.\\\" The complete integrated package that Apple offers, I have always found to be the best computing experience. And it doesn't scale.\\n\\nDavid: It didn't in that era for sure.\\n\\nBen: In that era, yeah. The way to scale is Make the software that is going to get distributed on the most PCs, and then that is the most interesting to software developers. It is the most interesting to consumers who want the software and IT buyers who want to buy the standard thing. Apple's strategy versus Microsoft strategy in this era, Apple was always going to be a bit player rather than the scale winner.\\n\\nThe trade off is lots of PCs had blue screens of death, Apple never had blue screens of death. Where do blue screens come from? It's driver problems. It's that the printer is not speaking the same language as your particular computer and what the operating system knows about your computer, and are the device drivers right for your particular version of whatever's on your motherboard? Apple never had those issues, but they also had very few units shipped and much more expensive product.\\n\\nDavid: Sidebar. That Alan Kay quote about if you really care about software, you do your own hardware, makes so much more sense to me now having done this episode, because he's coming from having made the Alto and the graphical interface there. The only way that he could have made the GUI on the Alto was basically building a mini computer.\\n\\nBen: Isn't that crazy?\\n\\nDavid: It makes so much more sense now.\\n\\nBen: A little bit more on Windows 95 before we finish the story here, it is remarkable to reflect that it took 5–6 years to go from Windows' plan B to Microsoft being extremely right that that was the franchise, that was the bet to bet the entire company on.\\n\\nAs Brad Silverberg put it this way to me, he said, Windows 95 cemented Windows as the franchise product for Microsoft, which interestingly it was not yet. David, this is crazy. It would remain the franchise product for the next 20 years, perhaps 5 or 10 years too long, but we'll save that story.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Just to put some numbers on this, August 24th, 1995 is the launch event, the glorious day. Windows 95 comes out. It sells a million copies in the first week, seven million copies in the first month.\\n\\nFiscal 1995—this is the 12 months ending in June before Windows 95 comes out—Microsoft did $5.9 billion in revenue. Fiscal 1996, they did $8.7 billion. Fiscal 1997 when Windows 95 is really going, they do $12 billion in revenue. First software company to pass $10 billion in revenue, already the most valuable company in the world. They are a monster. There is no other way to put it.\\n\\nBen: It's crazy. From a product perspective, there was just so much really got smoothed here. This was a user experience where they finally had time to think, what actually do users want to do with an operating system? What features should be part of the OS, and what should we delegate to applications? What are modern networking technologies that we should bring in?\\n\\nI don't want to foreshadow too much, but how should the Internet be in a modern operating system? That was a huge thing. The multimedia, the video stuff. An operating system really showed up and said, we thought about this experience for you. You're looking for where to start, you're looking for cool stuff to do, and you're looking for it to not break on you. We now finally have a complete story around all of that.\\n\\nA couple of interesting technical notes, it was basically all new technology. If you try to look this up, it will tell you, Windows 95 was DOS-based. It still used DOS in fallback situations for older DOS applications or drivers. But for most of the time, it was no longer true that Windows was just an operating environment on top of the DOS operating system.\\n\\nWindows had now become a true 32-bit operating system of its own. Windows did all the heavy lifting. It had its own file system. It accomplished a lot of the user experience magic and speed that it was praised for by rewriting a lot of this from scratch. This was the beginning of Windows as its own OS. You can see that actually change in the marketing messages that change from operating environment to operating system.\\n\\nDavid, that brings us to the end of our chapter one. We've got plenty of analysis here to do, but my God, what a first 20 years for the company.\\n\\nDavid: We knew this was going to happen. This is why we waited 10 years into Acquired's life to cover Microsoft. It's the most important company in the world still today.\\n\\nIt was so fun researching, going back and doing all this because there are so many different perspectives, and so much has been written. I don't know if we've gotten it right here, but I feel like every other major attempted storytelling at this has not gotten it right. Getting to go talk to all the people who were part of this...\\n\\nBen: Yeah, living in Seattle is quite helpful.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. We really got that sense of like, there's still a story to be told here. It's never been more relevant again than today. All that to say, I'm glad we waited 10 years.\\n\\nBen: And there's all this stuff we miss. I didn't mention Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research was a lot of people and a lot of money.\\n\\nDavid: Microsoft tried to buy Intuit too along the way. That got canned.\\n\\nBen: Actually, the start of research is interesting. I'll say this real quick. In 1991, Nathan Myhrvold started Microsoft Research, and the logic is fascinating. Basically, everything Microsoft had done until that point was taking things from mainframes and mini computers, and adapting those tasks, those jobs to be done for personal computers.\\n\\nAt some point, they looked around and said, all right, well, we did it. All the personal and business applications can now be run on personal computers, so we have to come up with uses for future technologies in order to continue to drive the ecosystem forward. There's no more low hanging fruit. I thought that was an interesting thesis of why to spin up a research division at that point in history.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Let's move into analysis.\\n\\nBen: Okay, great. Playbook. The big interesting one that I want to start with, and it actually involves a chapter from the story that we just glossed over, is capital efficiency allows founders to control their own destinies in a way that you just don't get when you're selling off huge chunks of the company in order to accomplish your mission.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, I love this.\\n\\nBen: Let's just talk through the cap table over time and how the company went public. We talked about the partnership being 64% Gates, 36% Paul Allen. In 1980, Steve Ballmer comes in and gets 8.5%, 8.75%, or something that percent of the company, so dilutes Gates and Allen down.\\n\\nIn 1981, just a year later, they take the VC investment for 5% of the company from TVI. This also, I'm guessing around 5% trying to reverse engineer some of the numbers. They also created an option pool, where they were then creating opportunity for basically rewarding management, which is how there were 10,000 millionaires created in the Seattle area from Microsoft.\\n\\nDavid: That's the amazing thing. The option pool doesn't get created until late in Microsoft's life. All those Microsoft millionaires only came from whatever size that was, 5% of the company or whatever.\\n\\nBen: At IPO, even with all this dilution, you've got the Ballmer dilution, the VC dilution, and the option pool dilution, Bill Gates still owned 49% of the company. That's pretty unprecedented. He wasn't the only one with a big chunk. Paul Allen owned 28% of the company. Steve had 7.5% of the company.\\n\\nThis company was basically owned by the three more or less co-founders. A little tiny option pool, and then a VC who ended up with 6.1%. I think Dave got some more shares from being on the board. You just don't see companies that look this anymore.\\n\\nDavid: This is Bill's company. This is their company in a way that no other company is these days. No venture-backed company going through the modern era is like that. By the time you get to be public, you may still be the largest shareholder as a founder or CEO, but it's not your company, far from it.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely. I'm trying to figure out why they were able to be so capital efficient. Is it just that software was such an unbelievably good business model compared to everything else that existed? They didn't need a lot of working capital, everything was high margin, they could grow really fast. Or it was just an era before much competition. They didn't need to out-raise their competitors. Once they got a little bit ahead, there was really no way for anybody else to close the gap, assuming that they executed well.\\n\\nDavid: I totally think it's the latter. I think it's that the minimum fixed cost threshold to be that, in Bill's words, slightly better than your competitors and get the positive spiral going, was low enough that it could be paid for just in Bill and Paul's time and effort. There was that unique moment at the beginning of the software industry where that was true, and that would never be true again.\\n\\nBen: That's so, so, so insane. There was no one else really with the knowledge either. Even if someone else came in with a big $1 million check and gave it to a competitor, in 1975, how many people could really write these language interpreters?\\n\\nDavid: You couldn't buy the experience having written emulation software for microprocessors that Paul had.\\n\\nBen: They had an obsession and an obscure skill that turned out to be one of the most valuable in the world in an area where there was a freak law of nature in play with Moore's Law that was so unintuitive, that you had to think from real first principles to understand the impacts of it.\\n\\nDavid: I think there are two freak laws of nature's one. (1) There was Moore's law that they were benefiting from. (2) There was the zero marginal cost of software.\\n\\nBen: That's true. It's this complete perfect storm that enabled them to build a highly defensible business without really any investment ever. This is the largest company in the world, the most valuable company in the world that was entirely bootstrapped.\\n\\nDavid: Even though they raised money, not a single dollar of investment actually happened at this company.\\n\\nBen: No, and in 1986, when they actually did go public, they raised $45 million. They never spent that because they generated much more free cash flow than that that year.\\n\\nDavid: It was just a means to an end of getting public.\\n\\nBen: And they needed to for the reason that they had been granting so many stock options from that little option pool to employees that they were going to blow the SEC's 500 shareholder cap. They projected 1987, so they wanted to go public on their own terms in 1986, not when they had to buy SEC rules.\\n\\nDavid: Also, Microsoft needed to be a public company. If you're going to be an important company in the world at this scale, if you're going to first ride the bear with IBM but then inherit the earth from IBM, you got to be a public company. You can't be a private partnership. You're not going to go have conversations with C-suites and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies if you are a private partnership in this era especially.\\n\\nBen: Maybe. I don't know. I'd agree with you if you had a bunch of short-term capital interests that owned your company, but if it's all founder-owned, there are great, large private companies in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, fair, true.\\n\\nBen: Coke Industries is a trusted company by a whole bunch of their customers. Cargill is even bigger than that. There's a bunch of European industrial and shipping companies. Rolex. There are privately-held, big, important companies in the world.\\n\\nDavid: For sure, but none of those companies are Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: That's true. That's very fair. Especially getting to the stage that they eventually got to being the trusted partner to governments around the free world, that requires being a public company.\\n\\nDavid: It's funny. This playbook theme, this was a moment in time and a set of factors where this worked. I guess the lesson is find an industry in its infancy, be capital-efficient, and run the table.\\n\\nBen: That has unique economic conditions that have never existed before to create these magical businesses you could never fathom before this new technology thing existed? It's an impossible thing to wish for. It may never happen again. We may never get another Google either.\\n\\nDavid: That's what I was going to say, it did happen again, it happened with Google.\\n\\nBen: But how many things can you collapse to zero? I think that's the question. With Microsoft, they were able to collapse their marginal cost to zero, but they still had distribution costs, and then Google collapsed distribution costs to zero with the Internet. What's a big cost that a company has now? Maybe AI will collapse. You no longer need 50,000 employees, you can have five employees. Maybe it can collapse that to zero.\\n\\nYou need something of that scale, which is, where does a company spend most of its money that suddenly it can spend no money on? I suppose actually it is on the human capital. You just look at big successful companies and look at what they spend money on. Those are the candidates.\\n\\nDavid: Good point. Still unlikely we'll ever find another Microsoft opportunity.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Other fun things on the IPO, do you know who IPO'd the day before Microsoft did?\\n\\nDavid: No.\\n\\nBen: Oracle. Oracle had a nice pop, which actually helped Microsoft price a little bit higher in their IPO. That is another episode we have to do.\\n\\nAnother thing adds yet another layer to the insanity of everything that we've been talking about of why they were able to build such a successful company on such little capital, I don't think there has ever been a tailwind in history like the one that Microsoft had with the secular growth of the personal computer wave. The only thing I can think of that is comparable is Amazon with the growth of the Internet, powering their early growth.\\n\\nHere's the stat. From 1975 to 1986, 11 years prior to their IPO, so founding to IPO, PCs grew at a compound annual growth rate of 98%. It grew from 4000 units per year to 9 million units per year shipped. You can almost not mess up when you have a tailwind that.\\n\\nDavid: Especially when you are the linchpin player.\\n\\nBen: They managed to make themselves the point of integration for the whole industry. Oftentimes, I find myself when we're looking at these companies that are among the most successful in the world or like Microsoft, the most successful in the world, it's basically a multidimensional multiplication problem.\\n\\nThey had this unbelievable one in a zillion thing going for them, which you can multiply by this other one in a zillion multi thing. It's the zero marginal cost, zero distribution cost, unbelievable secular growth of the PC, Moore's law happening. They're the single choke point for the whole industry. It's just crazy how many things you multiply together, and of course it should end up in a number over three trillion.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. I'll jump in with a playbook theme that we referenced a little bit in the episode, but we really got a highlight here. Bill, Steve, Paul, and everybody at Microsoft, were incredibly talented, incredibly smart. They saw the future in a way nobody else did, but they also were willing to hedge their bets.\\n\\nIt's not like they just got everything right. They were going to get things wrong with OS/2, but they hedged the bets with Windows. I think that is such a key lesson of when you're in a really dynamic market like this, in our ecosystem right now in tech, venture capital, startups, whatnot, people put so much value on conviction. I have conviction. This is what the future is going to be like. I think the Microsoft story is the opposite of that. They had conviction that software was going to be big.\\n\\nBen: And personal computers. Creating software for desktop computers was a really good idea, and they wanted to be the best at it.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, but the exact path of how that was going to play out, they had very little conviction and were willing to be very flexible.\\n\\nBen: You're right. It's both the hedging, but also then the ability to read the world and quickly, entirely change your strategy if you need to, and having your hedge be far enough along that you can jump quickly to it and shift your whole organization to get on board with it. That's a hard leadership thing to do.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I can't wait in the next episode to talk about the Internet tidal wave memo. That's related to your playbook theme too. You can't really do that if you don't own 49% of the company, if it's not your company.\\n\\nBen: Which I think you're seeing play out with most CEOs today. There's a big difference between a founder-CEO and the stuff that they can do. Zuckerberg with the metaverse or Jensen with betting the whole company and going all in again on AI versus Tim Cook or Sundar Pichai, certainly a very different type of CEO. Satya is interesting. Despite the fact that he doesn't own half the company, he's got a lot of founder-like control, which I think is pretty interesting.\\n\\nDavid: All right, don't get ahead of ourselves.\\n\\nBen: Moving along. Other playbook themes, a big one that jumps out to me is that new generations of technologies enable market dislocations. Unless you are in a transformational moment in terms of a new technology came out that enables something that wasn't possible before that's going to rearrange the whole value chain and open up new markets, it's pretty hard to go challenge an incumbent. No one was going to challenge IBM really until the microcomputer, even the minicomputer people. Did DEC really challenge IBM? Not really. It never made a dent.\\n\\nDavid: It wasn't a full platform shift in the same way.\\n\\nBen: And there are these little blips of it. The GUI I think meaningfully reshuffled the DECs. Those are the moments where you can have meaningful new entrants. Otherwise, you have to bide your time and just build your hedges and see.\\n\\nRelated, even if you are the incumbent being disrupted, it is possible to have a very, very large and durable revenue stream that can go on for a very long time. What I'm referring to in this particular example is despite all of the dethroning that we just talked about, Microsoft would not eclipse IBM in revenue. You mentioned market cap, David, but in revenue until the year 2015. Isn't that nuts?\\n\\nDavid: I intentionally didn't look up revenue because it made the story muddier, but wow, there you go.\\n\\nBen: I think that's the point. Microsoft's perception by the market, I'm sure they were growing faster, I'm sure they had better gross margins. I'm sure there was a better story there, so there's a multiple that comes out of the story. I'm sure there are lots of good reasons why Microsoft became more valuable than IBM very early, but IBM's revenue did not peak until 2012. What?\\n\\nLong after public perception moves on, customers still get value from something created by incumbents for a very long time. I think that's something we often forget about in the buzzy Twitterverse of like, oh that thing's over. It might still grow for another 20 years before it's over.\\n\\nDavid: That also just speaks to the nature of the enterprise business, too.\\n\\nBen: That's a good point.\\n\\nDavid: IBM was the enterprise business. Today, Microsoft is the enterprise business.\\n\\nBen: That's true. Peloton revenue can dry up a lot faster than contracts for mainframes. What do you got?\\n\\nDavid: A playbook theme that I want to highlight that really, really came out in our conversations is Microsoft was not just a talent magnet, the talent magnet during the PC era. If you were an ambitious young person, this is where you wanted to be.\\n\\nIt was on every dimension. If you were an ambitious young technical person, that's where you wanted to be. If you were an ambitious young salesperson, if you're an ambitious young marketing person, that's where you wanted to be.\\n\\nThey just had this culture there, which is so funny. We'll talk in the next episode of how that culture really fell apart for a while there. I asked a lot of these early people that we talked to, what was it being there? You guys worked yourselves half to death. Were you mad about that? Did you resent it? Were you just making Bill rich? They're all like, no. Yeah, we neglected every other part of our life, but that was the good old days. This was the magic, we were making it happen.\\n\\nBen: That totally comes through. I asked Brad, why did Windows 95 work? There's lots of structural reasons, but he said, we basically did two things. (1) We laid out principles for product and then pushed responsibility down. Developers were often their own PMs. There's this idea of once you got the principles, we don't need to write a zillion specs, design something three times, and pass it through three functions. You know the principles, make great software that follows the principles. (2) He said that everyone felt personally responsible for the product, and it really showed.\\n\\nDavid: Anybody you talked to from this era of Microsoft, this was their life's work. No doubt about it.\\n\\nBen: Something we touched on a little bit is the benefit of scaling with OEMs. This was the contrast against Apple, where I said Apple was always going to be a niche player by the way that they designed, built, and packaged everything themselves. Apple is in many ways like the AmEx, where Microsoft is the Visa.\\n\\nOn our Visa episode, it just became so clear that Visa could quickly take over the world at MasterCard by being an open network, where they didn't have to do all the work to scale themselves. They could distribute to a bank, partner with a bank, and then boom, each of the banks that was on their network could independently scale at their own rate, which created obviously compounding effects for how fast Visa and MasterCard could scale. The same can be said of Windows.\\n\\nDavid: Totally, the OEMs. Yeah.\\n\\nBen: I think the Microsoft OEM team for Windows was 20 people or something. Before the enterprise, in this era that we're talking about, the group of people responsible for go-to market for Windows was really small. They sold some retail, but the team was just about, hey, make sure HP and...\\n\\nDavid: Compaq, Dell, and Gateway.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. That was their go-to market, and it makes your scaling unbelievably efficient.\\n\\nDavid: Dude, you're getting a Dell.\\n\\nBen: Dude, you are getting a Dell. Similarly, I think the fact that they went international early was this very powerful constraint. It meant that every time they shipped software, they had to make it globally ready quickly. That meant that if there was any network effects to your software, anything becoming a standard, Microsoft was just way better positioned to become the standard than anyone else was.\\n\\nOn top of there being network effects, there's also scale economies. A word processor is a word processor. The extent that you have customers in every country who can buy your one piece of software, you can amortize the development costs over a huge user base so much more quickly.\\n\\nDavid: 100%.\\n\\nBen: The fact that they forced themselves to be international early meant that every product after that also had to figure out how to do all the localization, training, and all of that to get all those effects too.\\n\\nDavid: No matter how much time, money, and resources you have to spend to localize Microsoft word into kanji, it's a lot less time and resources and money than developing Microsoft word.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. They just realized that so early. They also realized that most people who were doing some localization would do a shoddy job. They would think about it as lesser than the US market. They just did a good job at localization. They just cared. They thought of it as this is a strategic pillar that in every country, everyone experiences our software to the same quality because it's our brand everywhere. I don't know. I just think that is not how the rest of the industry thought about it.\\n\\nDavid: Definitely not.\\n\\nBen: On top of all of this, the way that they executed it through subsidiaries was pretty genius. Redmond did not control international. They spun up country managers and subsidiaries in each of these countries in a ton of countries.\\n\\nWhile Redmond did the product development and then did the engineering work to do localization to all the strings files and everything for those countries, the actual marketing messaging, the sales strategy, and the sales structure, happened in country that was owned by a person who lived there so they actually could think through, what is the best way for people to receive this software here?\\n\\nAgain, that's just going to yield way better results than if you're sitting there armchair quarterbacking at Redmond thinking about how a person in Chile is going to receive your marketing message.\\n\\nOne other that I have is this one that we didn't really talk about, but Microsoft famously was not first to market with basically any of their applications. They aren't even really today in most cases. You think about the strategy that they had early on spreadsheets, word processing, all these were copycats at their outset.\\n\\nSometimes they would do an acquisition, but most of the time they just look at a product and say, huh, our software should do the same thing, and they would copy it. They had no shame in doing that. They had their eyes everywhere looking for good ideas, they had reverence for the good ones, and then they would just incorporate them.\\n\\nOn top of that, they wanted to make the software very easy to switch to. A lot of the keyboard shortcuts in Excel to this day are there because they were originally the Lotus 1-2-3 shortcuts. They wanted people to have the same muscle memory that just worked.\\n\\nFundamentally, what this does for you as a business is it just leads to better risk adjusted returns. You already know what's going to work before you ship it. You don't really take market risk. You're not going to be the first to the market with early adopters, but most of the time, you actually don't need to be to win.\\n\\nI think Microsoft own that idea. Most of the time people are sheepish about it. Steve Jobs famously said, Microsoft has no taste. I think that's another way to put it that it's copycatting.\\n\\nDavid: I do agree with the premise, with all of this. I think doing this episode though has made me think there's a little more nuance to it. Yes. In broad strokes, you can say that's what Microsoft strategy was with applications over the years, but the Microsoft versions never actually won until there was a platform shift that they could take advantage of to beat the incumbent.\\n\\nMicrosoft wasn't going to beat Lotus 1-2-3 until the graphical paradigm came along, and then Excel being graphical was just obviously so much better. They tried with Multiplan, they failed. Multiplan was fine, but 1-2-3 was the winner.\\n\\nThe nuance to me is yes, but it's more like with the resources of Microsoft and the timeframe that Microsoft can afford to have, they can afford to start building the application, start building the product, getting into market, start learning, be positioned that then when the paradigm shift comes, leap ahead.\\n\\nBen: That's a good point. It's also different. The Lotus 1-2-3–Multiplan thing, in that era, Microsoft just didn't have great distribution yet. Lotus 1-2-3 just got pretty far ahead of them, and Microsoft had no way to catch up. A few years after that, that would basically never be true again.\\n\\nDavid: That could be true too.\\n\\nBen: I will say, you touched on something that's an interesting corollary to this. Their first versions of software famously are not good. You look at Windows 1.0 and 2.0. They know that it's part of the strategy, and they were world class at learning from customers and integrating customer feedback into subsequent versions.\\n\\nThere's always this saying of Microsoft doesn't have a very good first or second version, but the third version of something is typically pretty good. I think that fact pattern definitely follows.\\n\\nDavid: I'm curious your thoughts on this. I'm so surprised. One thing that you have not brought up yet on this episode is you were a PM at Microsoft for several years.\\n\\nBen: I was, but it was such a different era in that 2012–2014 era. I guess 2011 is when I started as an intern. I'll have a lot of thoughts on it next episode.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, great. I've got one more playbook theme before we move on to power. Microsoft figured out software before anybody else, and they figured out so many aspects of what it means to be a software business before anybody else, but they figured out that software is never done.\\n\\nI do think a lot of their competitors, we didn't obviously didn't study Lotus to the same degree that we studied Microsoft here, we didn't study WordPerfect, et cetera, but I think there was a mindset that a lot of other folks are like, you ship software, and then the software was done.\\n\\nThat was not the culture at Microsoft. This is related to what you were just saying. Shipping software is the beginning. You are always working on that software. You're working on next versions and stuff, but even before the next version, the work of software is never done.\\n\\nBen: Of course, if you own the hardware, you definitely think of it more of like, well, we ship them, the big cabinet of things, we install it, and we fix it if it's broken, but we've sold them hardware. The software is required to run it, but the thing we sold them is the hardware. If you're a pure software company, you think about the world differently.\\n\\nYou're like, well, I can always ship you another CD, another floppy disk, over the Internet. It's obviously very different. But because there weren't really software companies before them, of course people didn't come from that mindset.\\n\\nDavid: I think you still see the legacy of this right to this day in Apple versus Microsoft. Apple still is on a yearly software release cadence, which is ridiculous. Whereas Microsoft is on the cloud, it's all constant. It's all constantly shipping. Look at AI, look at OpenAI. The software is never done so deeply in the software business model.\\n\\nBen: That's true.\\n\\nDavid: All right, should we move on to power?\\n\\nBen: Yes. Listeners who are new to the show, we do this section based on Hamilton Helmer's seven powers framework. The question is, what is it that enables a business to achieve persistent differential returns, or to put in another way, to be more profitable than your closest competitor and do so sustainably?\\n\\nThe seven are counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs, network economies, process power, branding, and cornered resource. David, I am pretty sure I could make a case somewhere between 1975 and 1995 at Microsoft for all seven of these.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: It's one of the most defensible businesses they built in history, so of course they would have all seven of the powers.\\n\\nDavid: All right, let's run through each of them and do a quick 45 seconds on each.\\n\\nBen: Great. Counter positioning. I think the biggest example of this comes through where Microsoft is basically willing to jump on the microcomputer revolution before the incumbents were. IBM did not want microcomputers to happen. When they started to happen, IBM tried to figure out how to slow it down and reintegrate it into their old business model.\\n\\nMicrosoft basically had no baggage. This is classic innovator’s dilemma stuff. They could say, well, we don't need to make any money on hardware. We don't need to even make hardware. We are free to become the whole point of integration for the entire ecosystem just by shipping bits. And that is crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Actually, related to that—I can't believe we haven't talked about this in the episode until now—Microsoft could enable other companies to be successful. You talk to Microsoft people, they always talk about themselves as a platform, like we're a platform. Other companies grow on the back of Microsoft. That was not true for IBM. Totally not true.\\n\\nMicrosoft could make Compaq successful. Microsoft could make Lotus successful. Microsoft could make Intuit successful. Microsoft could make Netscape successful.\\n\\nBen: We keep talking about Microsoft as the point of integration, choke point, dependency, or standard for the whole ecosystem. Given that, it is quite remarkable how much value they created on top of the platform versus just captured for themselves. There's that famous Bill Gates line, you want your ecosystem around you to be generating more revenue than you are taking for yourself. They did a ton of that. It's the OEMs, and it's the application developers.\\n\\nDavid: That's major counter positioning. Okay, that's one.\\n\\nBen: Scale economies.\\n\\nDavid: That's everything we just talked about in Playbook.\\n\\nBen: It's unbelievable. When Microsoft has an install base of 100 million people using Excel—in this episode, let's just say 10 million people who are using Excel—and suddenly some up and coming spreadsheet comes out with a cool feature like auto sum, fill down, draw borders around the cells, or whatever, suddenly, Microsoft does a tiny bit of dev work. They can reap tons and tons and tons of value for doing that that the tiny company cannot do.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, great.\\n\\nBen: Fixed amount of dev work amortized across a large customer base.\\n\\nDavid: I don't think we need to say any more on this. The whole episode's about scale economies.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Switching costs. The funny thing about monopoly is there's nothing to switch to.\\n\\nDavid: That's a good one. This one's pretty related to network economies for me with this one of, okay, sure, you can switch to another operating system. Good luck getting other applications that you know and love to run on that.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, that's the answer.\\n\\nDavid: Speaking of network economies, developers, applications, OEMs.\\n\\nBen: There's not a classic network, Facebook, or AT&T style network here, in terms of one user can contact every other user, but more users being on Windows incentivizes more developers to make great applications for Windows, which enables Microsoft to sell more copies to more users, et cetera.\\n\\nDavid: Although, actually, I think once they start getting into the enterprise workplaces in general, organizations in general, there is the user network effect, like I want this Microsoft Word document that I just worked on for you to be able to open it and use it too.\\n\\nBen: You're right. I didn't even think about that. The document formats are a huge network effect thing, even before the Internet. Even before organizations were networked and computers were networked outside of an organization, file formats. You're right, there are huge network economies to file formats.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and it's inter-organizational too. If I'm a law firm, I want my clients to be able to open my Word docs.\\n\\nBen: Right.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, next.\\n\\nBen: Process power. This might be the weakest.\\n\\nDavid: As it so often is.\\n\\nBen: It's elusive. This is a little bit later in history, but I did always think it was absolutely incredible when I was at Microsoft, and we would ship a version of Office every three years. I worked on Office 15. The entire 6000 person organization had a process in place, where we could release to manufacturing (RTM) on a date that we planned three years in advance and actually hit it.\\n\\nThe process of the ads cuts meetings, the zero bug bounce, the testing schedule, and the triage when you had things that people wanted to introduce late in the schedule. It was a remarkable product, especially with all these teams that needed all their code to interoperate.\\n\\nI worked on a shared experiences team that would check things and that would be a dependency. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, all of them took on the shared code. We knew our ship date three years in advance and would hit it. It's crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. This exists. Especially by the time you get to the Windows 95 era at the end of this episode, it's like RenTech. The amount of stuff and process within Microsoft, the device drivers, the middleware, the programming languages, the dev tools, the machine there to make all this computing work, there was a miracle that this stuff worked. You couldn't just recreate that.\\n\\nBen: It's funny. The process power, I would say, is stronger in Office than Windows. Now my colors are showing. Windows always notoriously miss their ship dates. I'm actually less sure that process power existed in that early days. I think they were a bunch of smart people, but I'm not sure that they had a unique way of creating software.\\n\\nDavid: I think that got built over time.\\n\\nBen: Agree.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, branding, for sure.\\n\\nBen: For sure.\\n\\nDavid: Don't get fired for buying Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: That's true. Windows 95 built a consumer brand. The idea of a consumer brand of operating systems was there was Apple, but they were tiny, and that was more around the hardware.\\n\\nDavid: It's both fronts. It's their brand in the enterprise that is an amazing story that they built. They were branding consumer. The easiest to point to instantiation is the Rolling Stones and Jay Leno, but they had a software brand. Nobody had that.\\n\\nBen: But branding is probably the thing that they rely on the least interestingly enough. There are other structural reasons that they're entrenched, where even if Microsoft had a crappy brand in this era, they probably still would have won. The magic of getting the whole deal with the IBM PC and then getting to sell licenses to all the other OEMs.\\n\\nDavid: That brings us to the last one, which I think is a super strong one at least in this era, cornered resource. DOS, full stop.\\n\\nBen: Yup. It didn't start as a cornered resource, but as soon as IBM started shipping it on the IBM PCs, it was over. I'll say it again, IBM's distribution created demand for DOS, and then Microsoft just got to capture value from everyone else who wanted it.\\n\\nAll right, we would do bear and bull, listeners, but we know what happened after this. The bull case is that the party continues, and Microsoft continues shipping amazing operating systems after amazing operating systems. That stays the important thing in the world. The bear case is something else becomes an important thing in the world. Just having this super locked-in operating system is not actually the way to bet your whole company for the future.\\n\\nDavid: The dramatic tension for you all to come back for our next episode on Microsoft here is not because you want to find out what happens.\\n\\nBen: That's true.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, take away, splinter. We've spent the last probably six weeks deep in this. We've talked to everybody. What are you thinking about in the middle of the night?\\n\\nBen: The IBM deal. I can't unsee it. Microsoft figured out a way to take someone else's dominance and wholesale transfer that into their dominance for the next generation. The fact that IBM called the Project Chess is so deeply ironic because Bill Gates was playing chess and they played checkers.\\n\\nDavid: Maybe Bill was playing 3D chess. This is the thing about it, though. We got to give IBM so much credit for Project Chess and the PC, that they even did what they did was huge, that a big entrenched corporation that could ship a skunkworks project in a year, revolutionized the industry. They just didn't end up capturing any value out of it.\\n\\nBen: If I could make a less cheeky comment on it, I would say it's that a new technology generation, when something becomes possible and opens up a new market, it enables a shift in the point of integration and a value chain.\\n\\nThe old value chain of IBM, if you shipped the mainframe, you had all the power. But in this new world of PCs, if you controlled the operating system that all the users were familiar with and all the developers wanted to target, you had all the power. I think that is not necessarily obvious unless you went through it and have the hindsight of history to be able to articulate it.\\n\\nDavid: I think you might be right. I think this might be the single best business deal negotiation of all time.\\n\\nBen: It arguably created $3 trillion of value.\\n\\nDavid: No, a lot more than that because this is the point about Microsoft being a platform. Microsoft is worth $3 trillion, but how much value has been created on top of Microsoft? No matter what you think, good, bad, or ugly of Microsoft, you can't deny that.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely.\\n\\nDavid: At least twice as much, probably much, much more.\\n\\nBen: You watch every early interview with Bill, and you read a lot of his writing, he's a great writer. It's awesome that so many of his memos leaked whether intentionally or unintentionally over time.\\n\\nDavid: So many of his memos were issued for publication.\\n\\nBen: He really did view himself as a steward of the software ecosystem, and had this steadfast belief that software was magic and was going to change the world. Over the next 20 years, from 1975 to 1995, software did change the world, and Microsoft enabled it to happen.\\n\\nAgain, good, bad, or ugly, whatever you think of the company, they were sincere. I think the ugly part is, a lot of people want to hate on the value capture, because god did they capture value, but they were sincere in their desire and ability to create too.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. That's super related to my takeaway here. The moment for me in the research and then when we're telling the story along the way is when they start to believe in themselves that they don't need IBM. Just the audacity, and I mean that in a pure good way of these kids. These kids changed the world. That's so trite to say.\\n\\nMy book we read my daughter at bedtime and somebody gave us, it's like the most Silicon Valley trophy thing ever. It's like, what do you do with an idea? The punchline at the end of it is you change the world. It's become such a trope, but these kids in the 70s did it. They believed in themselves in the beginning and then more and more and more over time.\\n\\nThere's just this moment that I think, where they started to really, truly believe that they were going to change the world. Again, good, bad and ugly come out of that. Mostly good, I think, but just the level of ambition and audacity of these people is staggering.\\n\\nBen: Is that your splinter in your mind?\\n\\nDavid: That's my splinter, yeah.\\n\\nBen: Listeners who are new to the show, we've been iterating on how we end episodes. We decided on this recently of, how should we land the plane? It's to talk about the thing that we can't stop thinking about.\\n\\nDavid: This company's 49 years old, and it's still the most valuable company in the world.\\n\\nBen: Crazy. All right, David, I have some trivia for you.\\n\\nDavid: I love it. Trivia before carve outs.\\n\\nBen: Do you know where Dave Marquardt from TVI first encountered Bill Gates?\\n\\nDavid: No, I just assumed it was through Steve.\\n\\nBen: Dave had watched Bill present many years earlier at none other than the Homebrew Computer Club at Stanford, the very place that is part of the Apple lore with Jobs and Woz showing off the early Apple computer. Apparently, Bill also went and made a presentation there and would hang out there, and that is where Dave first came across him.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing. When we were talking about the letter that Bill writes to the hobbyist community decrying piracy and software, he's basically writing it to the Homebrew Computer Club. He believed that those were the people who were ripping off his software.\\n\\nBen: It's amazing. All right, carveouts?\\n\\nDavid: All right, carveouts. For new listeners, at the end of every episode, Ben and I just chat about one or two things that we've been enjoying personally lately that usually have nothing to do with the episode.\\n\\nIn my case, I have two. The first one has a lot to do with the episode. I have discovered/rediscovered the LGR YouTube channel. Are you into this Ben?\\n\\nBen: No.\\n\\nDavid: Clint and LGR, and it stands for Lazy Game Reviews, which I think is how it started, but then it became so much more, and now it's just LGR. Clint is this awesome dude, and I think he lives in North Carolina. He is dedicated to basking in the glory, restoring, reliving, and preserving computer history, hardware and software from this era. The YouTube channel is all unboxing a Compaq PC from 1992 or restoring a Windows 3.1 machine.\\n\\nBen: That's awesome.\\n\\nDavid: It's so good. He's got the best, most soothing voice in the world. He just seems like such a nice dude. He's dedicated to preserving the era of computing that we are talking about on this episode. It's so fun.\\n\\nBen: That's cool. It's really hard because all hardware fails eventually. At some point, there will be zero computers out there that can run Windows 3.1 that will boot. The only way to experience any of these things is through an emulator. I don't know. To be able to capture high-res footage and stuff of those machines while they still work, it's cool.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, super cool. My other carve out is Andre 3000 from Outkast. Do you know what Andre 3000 is up to these days?\\n\\nBen: Not at all. No.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, my God. Okay. GQ just did a big interview with Andre 3000 because he just released a new album. This is not what you think. Andre, a lot of people say, consensus top five rappers of all time. Big Boi, his counterpart in Outkast, also great too, but they basically went out on top.\\n\\nThey did Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which was their double album. I think it came out 2004 maybe. I was a freshman in college.\\n\\nBen: Hey Ya was on that, right?\\n\\nDavid: Hey Ya, yeah, everything was on that. They did one more album, and then they stopped. Andre would be featured on some other rappers tracks over the years, but didn't put out another album for close to 20 years. He just put out an album, and he just did this big video interview with GQ.\\n\\nThe album is a flute album. He got really into woodwind instruments. This has been his life. He reveals in the interview that he has put out other songs and other albums over the years under pseudonyms. This interview is so great. It's so unexpected because the interviewer keeps asking, you're Andre 3000, why'd you stop rapping? I don't have anything to say. Am I going to rap about getting a colonoscopy? This is where my life is right now. I never wanted to put out any work that wasn't both authentic and great. I didn't have anything to say anymore.\\n\\nBen: Yup, I love that. If you ever heard the phrase, go out when the top row at the back of the auditorium is empty?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and that's what they did. Idlewild which was the album that came out after Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, was great, but it wasn't that, and yet that's exactly what he did.\\n\\nBen: I think it's a Seinfeld quote. I might misattribute it. Drop a note in the Slack if I did, but I think it's a Seinfeld quote. \\\"You let one row be empty, but you don't want to wait too long.\\\"\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, it's the same thing as what Seinfeld did.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: Super fun. We'll link to it in the show notes.\\n\\nBen: All right. I have three and they're all different. We've had a tradition on the recent episodes of doing multiple carveouts, and all of them are different genres. My product that I've really been loving, my physical product is the Meta Ray-Bans.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. I was talking with the team at Meta about them. They're doing great.\\n\\nBen: I bet. It's a pretty delightful product. I bought them because I was in Hawaii and with my four month old son. We were in the pool and stuff. My iPhone's waterproof, but I want a different angle, and I don't necessarily want to be holding my phone. It's very cool to be able to take pictures and record video of what I actually see to be able to relive that moment.\\n\\nI did a bunch of photos and video. We were on vacation that way, and then I discovered a thing that they're actually just awesome for. I think even better than AirPods is phone calls. The speakers are great. I wouldn't say necessarily they're the best for listening to music. The bass is obviously not as good as headphone bass. They project the sound down toward your ears. Unless you're standing really close to me, you can't really hear, or unless I have the volume all the way up.\\n\\nThe microphones are great too. I was on a long walk on the beach with the wind whipping by on a call with my mom. I was like, does this sound really bad and distorted to you? She's like, not at all. I was really impressed and we'll definitely be using them for more calls. I think that style of headphone over the ear, there are many things that it's not good for.\\n\\nWhen you're on an airplane or something, you want to plug your ears, or if you're in a super loud environment. But unless you're in one of those environments, it's a nice break for your ears versus having AirPods jammed in. It's a great call experience. So they're great.\\n\\nThe battery's great. It's a four-hour battery, so it's a low key, more subtle, augmented reality experience. There's no heads up display. You don't see anything, but when you get a text message, it'll read it to you.\\n\\nDavid: There's more than just the camera system.\\n\\nBen: Totally. It basically is you have AirPods in, but you don't actually have AirPods in, and you have a pretty good photo video camera on your face.\\n\\nDavid: Does it have an indication when you're taking photo or recording video?\\n\\nBen: Yes. It's not super bright. I'm not sure everybody really knows when you are, but if you know what to look for, you know if it's on or off.\\n\\nDavid: Cool.\\n\\nBen: I've been loving it. I think it's a great product. I intend to wear them a lot this summer.\\n\\nMy second one is a thank you to a very, very good designer, Julia Rundberg, who worked with David and I on a recent project for some design work, some of which is actually featured as we speak on Apple podcasts. She did a bunch of other stuff with us, too, and she's really excellent.\\n\\nIf you're looking for someone who's good at visual identity, branding, slide decks, websites, I've worked with her on a few projects before and she's just awesome, so I wanted to recommend her.\\n\\nMy third is this community spotlight to go all the way back to nine years ago Acquired. It was a listener who runs a company called Summer Health reached out and said, I heard you say that you have a baby. I've got this great company that is for new parents, and here's some info on it. I am now a paying member. It is an on-demand texting relationship with a pediatrician.\\n\\nDavid: Wow. This is crack for new parents.\\n\\nBen: It is crack for parents. It's crazy. You can hook up multiple phones, so my wife and I both have a direct line to like, something weird is going on, will you help me through it? We had a 2:00 AM wake up the other night. Everything ended up being fine, but as I'm sure any other new parents can relate to, you really want to make sure in the middle of the night, if you're not sure if everything's fine, you would like to figure out the right steps to make sure everything's fine. Having a virtual doctor on demand is totally amazing. Summer Health, if you are a new parent, we've been loving it.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing. I'm going to have to subscribe. We've referred to this before. I think this will probably be the last episode that comes out while I'm still the parent of just one child. Number two coming soon. If it may take a little longer than usual for the next Microsoft episode to come out, our next six-hour opus on Microsoft, don't get too mad, that is the reason why.\\n\\nBen: We have a lot of thank yous on this one, as you can imagine. People were really generous with their time, pointing us to different resources, explaining their recollection of history as it happened. Being in Seattle, active in the venture community here, both through PSL and David, you're in my shared history at Madrona, me working at Microsoft, a lot of good opportunities to learn what really happened from folks.\\n\\nA huge thank you to Mike Slade who spent the time with me. Mike spent two different stints at Microsoft and then at NeXT, and Apple in between.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, he worked for Steve at NeXT, right?\\n\\nBen: Yup. One of the few people in the world who both spent a ton of time with Steve, Bill, and worked closely with both of them. It's so great to get his perspective, especially about the early days of Office and the applications group. Very helpful. Similarly, Pete Higgins worked closely with Mike. Pete, I think, ran Excel for a long time and oversaw a lot of the different stuff in the applications group, and I believe also ran Office.\\n\\nIt's funny how many different people picked up the mantle over time as these things traded around groups. But frankly, I think that's a huge part of the Microsoft story. The company very quickly adapted and changed its structure depending on the current needs of technology, competitors, and et cetera.\\n\\nHuge thanks to Tren Griffin, who is actually a lifelong Seattleite and close friend to the whole Gates family. Bill Gates Sr. was his mentor. I'm sure you've seen Tren's prolific tweets online about Microsoft history. Actually, Tren I think currently works at Microsoft in a strategy role. Thanks Tren for your help as well. David, I know you've got a bunch.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Also, speaking of former Microsoft folks who are very active and prolific on Twitter, we talked to Steven Sinofsky who had lots and lots of great perspective, and we can't wait to share more of it on the next episode.\\n\\nBen: I read 20 of Steven's Hardcore Software posts. When David and I were dividing up what belongs in what episode, I realized 19 of them belong in next episode. Steven, thank you for your early prep work for part two.\\n\\nDavid: So much fun internet stuff to talk with that Steven was right there for. I spoke with other people who ran windows, Terry Myerson who's a great friend and a supporter of the show. Terry ran Windows for quite a long time, right?\\n\\nBen: Yeah. When I was there, Terry was EVP over Windows and Windows Phone.\\n\\nDavid: Terry was very generous. He was actually the first person that clued us into just how key Steve's role was in building the enterprise for Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: And how different the go to market motions were for Windows and Office. I think Terry was the one that gave us the insight of Windows, especially in the early days. It was basically an OEM game, small group doing an OEM thing.\\n\\nDavid: There were 10 people selling that.\\n\\nBen: And it's still I don't think a very big team even today.\\n\\nDavid: Speaking of strategy, Charles Fitzgerald, who's OG in Microsoft and a great platform strategy guy, prolific angel investor in Seattle now, it's fun chatting with him about the early days.\\n\\nBen: Obviously, Brad Silverberg who we mentioned a bunch. It was very fun seeing after spending some time talking with Brad and texting a lot with him to see the end of the Windows 95 announcement after Bill and Jay Leno are done for Brad to come out and finish it off. It's fun. It's like watching a time machine, watching that thing is really cool.\\n\\nSoma Somasegar at Madrona is someone that David and I love crossing paths with in the Seattle entrepreneurship ecosystem.\\n\\nDavid: Soma's just such a legend at Microsoft and in the industry too. There's so many people who Soma made their careers, plucked them out of school, saw something in them that maybe they didn't even see in themselves, and then they went on to be big executives or venture capitalists at Microsoft or elsewhere.\\n\\nBen: Lastly, huge thank you to Steve Ballmer. To be honest, it was a little bit surreal chatting and hearing about his experience over the whole thing. There's nobody including Bill Gates that bleeds Microsoft more than Steve Ballmer, and his just unabashed pure pride in what they built is infectious.\\n\\nDavid: Absolutely. It was so fun talking to Steve. He was so gracious with his time. It must have been just super special for you too. He was the CEO when you worked there.\\n\\nBen: Totally. To be frank, I had a very opposite strategy in mind, but I was a new hire out of college, individual contributor PM. It was still the Windows company then, and Steve was championing the Windows strategy, and I was a guy working on Office for iPad.\\n\\nWith that, our huge thank you to JP Morgan Payments, ServiceNow, and Pilot. You can click the link in the show notes to learn more about any of those great partners of Acquired.\\n\\nIf you like this episode, I was thinking of ones to recommend. It would be pretty funny to go listen to the forethought acquisition, given all of this context. It's a short episode when David and I were not good at this yet, and we did our very best. It is from our early days, and it covers overlapping source material.\\n\\nDavid: Forethought was the company that made PowerPoint, Microsoft acquired, the first major acquisition for the company.\\n\\nBen: If you are new to the show and looking for great recent episodes that we've done, I highly recommend the Visa one as discussed earlier in the Network of Networks idea, if you haven't heard that, or perhaps the Nintendo or NVIDIA episodes, all of which will be right up your alley if you liked this one.\\n\\nDavid: If you're not at all interested in technology or software, but have somehow managed to get through all these hours with us, give a listen to our LVMH and Hermes episodes. Even if you do love technology and software, which obviously you do if you're still here, there's so much to learn from that world.\\n\\nBen: If you want to know every time an episode drops, get hints at the next episode topic, and get episode corrections and follow up, you can sign up at acquired.fm/email. Come discuss this episode with everyone else who's chatting about it at acquired.fm/slack.\\n\\nIf you're looking for another episode, go check out our second show, ACQ2, where we will have actually some very awesome tech CEO guests coming out over the next month or so that are absolutely worth listening to, especially if you're interested in semiconductor and tech history. If you want some sweet Acquired merch, go to acquire.fm/store.\\n\\nWith that, listeners, we'll see you next time.\\n\\nDavid: We'll see you next time.\\n\\n\",\n",

Doug Englebart's “Mother of All Demos” was at Stanford Research Institute in 1968, demoing the first mouse, graphical user interface, and more. Many of these team members did however go onto form the core group of researchers at Xerox PARC.\\n\\n• We said that Steve Ballmer became the development manager for Windows 1.0 after the former dev manager was fired. That is not the case — that person resigned unexpectedly.\\n\\n• We left out the story of the development of “Protect Mode” Windows, which was a secret skunkworks project driven by a brilliant engineer named David Weise and his boss, Phil Barrett. (And not authorized by management!) By accessing the Intel 386 processor’s “protect mode”, David was able to allow Windows apps to use the chip’s full 16MB of memory, instead of just the standard 1MB memory they otherwise would have had. This was absolutely essential to making Windows commercially and technically viable in the marketplace (and eventually led to it dominating OS/2, Mac, etc). (Thanks to Rob Glaser)\\n\\n• Windows 386 was a key bridge product that paved the way for Windows 3.0 and 3.1. Win386 leveraged one key feature of the 386 chip that wasn’t in the 286 – the ability to multitask multiple 8086 virtual machines, which allowed multiple DOS apps to stay active at the same time. This was a super valuable feature for several transitional years. (Thanks to Rob Glaser)\\n\\n• The competing OS from UCSD was actually called “UCSD p-System”, not Pascal. Pascal was and is a programming language that UCSD contributed heavily to.

(Thanks also to Brad Feld)\\n\\n• The decision to have Excel be made for the Mac instead of the PC was a huge and very disruptive decision made by Bill personally. Excel (code named Odyssey at the time) was originally being developed for the PC. When Bill changed it, the team didn’t like it, and the head of the Odyssey team (Doug Klunder) decided to quit over that decision (but was persuaded to stay until Excel 1.0 shipped).

And yet no one at RenTec would consider themselves an “investor”, at least in any traditional sense of the word. It’d rather be more accurate to call them scientists — scientists who’ve discovered a system of math, computers and artificial intelligence that has evolved into the greatest money making machine the world has ever seen. And boy does it work: RenTec’s alchemic colossus has posted annual returns in the firm’s flagship Medallion Fund of 68% gross and 40% net over the past 34 years,while never once losing money. (For those keeping track at home, $1,000 invested in Medallion in 1988 would have compounded to $46.5B today… if you’d been allowed to keep it in.)

      "        \"transcript\": \"Ben: I always used to misspell Renaissance as I was typing it out at R-E-N, and then I would not really know what came from there, but I learned a mnemonic to make sure I get it right.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, I thought you were going to say you’ve typed it so many times now over the past month.\\n\\nBen: Well, there’s that too. But you ready for this? You can’t spell Renaissance without AI.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, touche, touche.\\n\\nBen: All right, let’s do it.\\n\\nWelcome to season 14, episode 3 of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. I’m Ben Gilbert.\\n\\nDavid: I’m David Rosenthal.\\n\\nBen: And we are your hosts. They say, David, that as an investor, you can’t beat the market or time the market, that you’re better off indexing and dollar cost averaging rather than trying to be an active stock picker. They say there’s no persistence of returns for hedge funds, that this year’s big winner can be next year’s big loser, and that nobody gets huge outperformance without taking huge risk.\\n\\nDavid: When I was in college, I actually took an economics class with Burton Malkiel, who of course was involved in starting Vanguard and who’s a big proponent of all that. And that is what I learned, Ben.\\n\\nBen: Well, David, it turns out they were wrong. Today, listeners, we tell the story of the best performing investment firm in history—Renaissance Technologies or RenTech. Their 30-year track record managing billions of dollars has better returns than anyone you have ever heard of, including Berkshire Hathaway, Bridgewater, George Soros, Peter Lynch, or anyone else.\\n\\nSo why haven’t you heard of them? Or if you have, why don’t you know much about them? Well, their eye-popping performance is matched only by their extreme secrecy, and they are unusual in almost every way. Their founder, Jim Simons, worked for the US government in the Cold War as a codebreaker before starting Renaissance.\\n\\nNone of the founders or early employees had any investing background, and they built the entire thing by hiring PhD physicists, astronomers, and speech recognition researchers. They’re located in the middle of nowhere in a tiny town on Long Island. They don’t pay attention to revenues, profits, or even who the CEOs are of the companies that they invest in. And at any given time, they probably couldn’t even tell you what actual stocks they own.\\n\\nNow you may be thinking, okay, great, I just learned about this insane fund with unbelievable performance—to be specific listeners, that’s 66% annual returns before fees—and I want to invest. Well, you can’t. To add to everything else that I just said, RenTech’s flagship Medallion fund doesn’t take any outside investors. The partners of the firm have become so wealthy from the billions that the fund has generated that the only investors they allow in are themselves.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, we are going to talk a lot about that towards the end of the episode, because I think it’s the key to the whole thing.\\n\\nBen: Ooh, Cliffhanger. David. I’m excited. So what exactly does Renaissance do? Why does it work? And how did it evolve to be the way it is today? While the resources out there are scarce because for one, employees sign a lifetime non-disclosure agreement, David and I are going to take you through everything we’ve learned about the firm from our research dating all the way back before Jim Simons started as a math professor to understand it all.\\n\\nThis episode was selected by our Acquired limited partners. To be honest, I didn’t think enough people knew what RenTech was to pick it, but when we put it out for a vote, the people have spoken.

If you want more from David and I, check out ACQ2. Our most recent episode was with Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, who led the team that created the first GLP-1s at Novo Nordisk, so awesome follow-up to the Novo episode if you liked that one.\\n\\nBefore we dive in, we want to briefly share our presenting sponsor this season, is J.P. Morgan, specifically their incredible payments business.\\n\\nDavid: Just like how we say every company has a story, every company’s story is powered by payments, and J.P. Morgan Payments is a part of so many companies that we talk about on Acquired. It’s not just the Fortune 500 too. They’re also helping companies grow from seed to IPO and beyond.\\n\\nBen: Yup. With that, the show is not investment advice, David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss, or perhaps wish we did, and this show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. David, where do we start our story today?\\n\\nDavid: We start in 1938 in Newton, Massachusetts, which is a fairly wealthy suburb just outside of Boston, where one James Simons is born. Both of Jim’s parents were very, very smart, especially his mother, Marsha. His dad was a salesman for 20th Century Fox, the movie company. His job was he went around to theaters in the northeast and sold packages of movies to them.\\n\\nBen: Super cool.\\n\\nDavid: By the way, we know all this because we have to thank Greg Zuckerman, author of The Man Who Solved the Market, which is the only book out there that is solely dedicated to RenTech and Jim Simons. We actually got to talk to Greg in our research. He helped us out a bunch. Thank you, Greg.\\n\\nBen: And helped fact check a few of our assumptions of what happened after the book came out.\\n\\nDavid: So that was Jim’s parents, but really a major influence on him growing up was his grandfather, Marsha’s dad. There are already echoes of the Bezos story here with the grandfather, the mother’s father, spending a bunch of time with him, and rubbing off on young Jeff, or young Jim in this case. Bezos, of course, would get his start in his career at D. E. Shaw.\\n\\nBen: A quant fund coming up at the same time as RenTech.\\n\\nDavid: But back to Jim here in the 1940s, his grandfather Peter, owned a shoe factory that made women’s dress shoes. Jim spends a ton of time there growing up at the factory.\\n\\nJim’s grandfather, Peter, was quite the character. He was a Russian immigrant and he’s still more Russia than Boston at this point in time. As Greg puts it in the book, Peter reveled in telling Jim and his cousins stories of the motherland involving wolves, women, caviar, and vodka. He teaches young Jim when he’s a child here in the factory to say Russian phrases like, give me a cigarette and kiss my ass.\\n\\nBen: Which I think he probably would say that thousands of times the rest of his life.\\n\\nDavid: I think so. If you watch interviews with Jim, his hands are always twitching because he has chain-smoked his entire life, probably going back to age 10 in the factory.\\n\\nBen: Three packs of Merits a day.\\n\\nDavid: Unbelievable.\\n\\nBen: Although I think he quit later in life, but he definitely chain-smoked the better part of the first (call it) 75 years or something.\\n\\nDavid: There are these famous stories of the conference rooms at RenTech and the war rooms when the market is going through a crazy gyration, and it’s just filled with cigarette smoke and it’s all Jim.\\n\\nBen: Different time.\\n\\nDavid: Different time. So back to Jim’s childhood, though, here in the Boston suburbs. He grows up certainly not uber wealthy or uber rich, but very, very solidly upper middle class. And especially he’s an only child, he has all the resources of his parents, his family, his grandfathers, this well-to-do entrepreneur.\\n\\nJim gets to rub shoulders in the Boston area with people who are really rich. He says later, “I observed that it’s very nice to be rich. I had no interest in business, which is not to say I had no interest in money.”\\n\\nBen: Yes. Important to tease out the difference between those two things.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Very, very important. What he means when he says he has no interest in business, it’s because from a pretty young age, he gets really into math. Legend has it when Jim is four years old, he stumbles into one of Zeno’s famous paradoxes from ancient Greek times.\\n\\nBen: Yup. This is great. The basic gist of Zeno’s paradoxes, if you are always taking a quantity and dividing it by two, you will never hit zero. You’ll asymptotically approach zero, but you will never actually touch zero. You need to do addition or subtraction to do that. Division won’t cut it.\\n\\nJim, as a 4-year-old, when he observes they need to go to the gas station to fill up the tank, he throws out the idea, well, let’s just use only half the gas in the tank because then we’ll still be able to, after that, only use half the gas in the tank. The funny thing that doesn’t occur to a 4-year-old is, well then, we’re just not going to get very far.\\n\\nDavid: Jim’s dream is to go to MIT down the street in Cambridge and study math. He graduates high school in three years, and during the second semester of Jim’s freshman year there, he enrolls in a graduate math seminar on abstract algebra. Pretty heavy stuff.\\n\\nBen: Jim would go on to finish his undergrad at MIT in three years, and get a master’s in one year.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Pretty, pretty smart. But it turns out that that freshman year grad seminar he took actually has a big impact on him because he doesn’t do well in the class. He can’t keep up. Jim’s pretty self-aware here.\\n\\nThere are other people at MIT who never run into problems. They never hit a limit, they never struggle understanding any concept. He realizes that, oh, I’m smart, I’m very, very smart. I’m smarter than most other people here. But I’m not one of those people.\\n\\nBen: Which is what do you do with that information? You realize you have to add a few of your skills together to become the best at something. You have to be smart and something else.\\n\\nDavid: Jim’s own words on this are, I was a good mathematician. I wasn’t the greatest in the world, but I was pretty good. But he recognizes, like you said, Ben, that he has a different advantage that most of the super geniuses lacked. And that’s, as he put it, he had good taste.\\n\\nThese are his words. “Taste in science is very important. To distinguish what’s a good problem and what’s a problem that no one’s going to care about the answer to anyway, that’s taste. And I think I have good taste.”\\n\\nBen: By the way, this is exactly the same thing as Jeff Bezos in college, realizing he wanted to be a theoretical physicist. He met some of the extreme brainpower people that would go on to become the best theoretical physicists in the world. He said, I’m smart, but I’m not that smart, so switched to computer science.\\n\\nDavid: I think the analogy here is like sports. There are all-star players, there are Hall of Famers, and then there are LeBron and MJ. Jim ends up being a Hall of Famer mathematician, but he’s not Tom Brady.\\n\\nBen: He is got a pretty important theorem named after him.\\n\\nDavid: That goes on to become a foundation of string theory in physics, which isn’t even Jim’s field.\\n\\nBen: Crazy.\\n\\nDavid: So this realization that Jim has about himself, though, both that he’s not the smartest person in the room at a place like MIT, but he can hang with them, and that he has this taste concept, (I think) becomes one of the most important keys to the secret sauce that ends up getting built at RenTech.\\n\\nHe can relate to everybody. He understands what’s going on. Any person off the street probably couldn’t even really have a conversation with these folks, but he can. And yet he also has the perspective, maybe some of this is from his grandfather of what is important out there in the real world. And as a result, all of his friends at MIT and these super smart people look up to him because you aren’t like the kid in the corner at the high school dance. You’re cool.\\n\\nBen: He’s the extroverted theoretical mathematician.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. He was elected class president in high school. He smoked cigarettes. He’s popular with the ladies. He looks like Humphrey Bogart. He’s a popular dude, especially at this point in time—we’re now in the late 50s when Jim’s at MIT—this is kind of the James Dean and Rebel Without A Cause era.\\n\\nAfter graduation, Jim leads his buddies on a road trip with motor scooters—you can’t make this stuff up—from Boston down to Bogota, where one of his classmates is from. The idea is that they’re going to do something so epic that the newspapers are going to have to write about it. They all load up on scooters and drive down to Bogota. They get into all sorts of adventures. There are knives, guns, and they get thrown in jail.\\n\\nBen: It’s honestly crazy that this group of people took this type of risk.\\n\\nDavid: Totally crazy. After he is done an MIT and after the road trip, Jim heads out to Berkeley in California so that he could do his PhD with the Professor Shiing-Shen Chern. Much later in life, Jim would collaborate with Chern for the Chern-Simons theory that we talked about earlier that becomes one of the foundational parts of string theory in physics.\\n\\nBefore Jim leaves for the West coast, he meets a girl in Boston, and they decide to get engaged in four days. This is him back then, these were the times. When they get to California and they get married, Jim takes the $5000 wedding gift that I believe they got from her parents and he decides, I want to multiply this. So he starts driving from Berkeley into San Francisco every morning to go hang out at the Merrill Lynch brokerage office, just be a rat hanging around the brokerage and find ways to trade and turn this money into something more.\\n\\nBen: Which is so interesting to think about because at that point in time, there was such an advantage to just being there. This wasn’t even the trading floor, but information is all so manual and also relationship-driven in the markets, that there was basically no way to be in on the action unless you were physically there in on the action.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. You couldn’t just log into Yahoo Finance or something, or open the stocks app on your iPhone, which even the information they were getting was God knows how long delayed from New York or from Chicago for the futures and commodities that are being traded that Jim gets into. He’s as close to the action as he can possibly be, but he’s a long, long way from the action. Nonetheless, when he starts out doing this, Jim hits a hot streak and he goes up 50% in a few days.\\n\\nBen: Trading is easy.\\n\\nDavid: Trading is easy. He says, I was hooked. It was a rush.\\n\\nBen: I bet.\\n\\nDavid: Except he ends up losing all of his profits just as quickly.\\n\\nBen: Important to learn that lesson early.\\n\\nDavid: Also right around this time, Barbara (his wife) gets pregnant with their first child and is like, you can’t be driving into San Francisco every morning and gambling our future like this.\\n\\nBen: Effectively playing the ponies.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Jim’s like, okay, okay, I’ll stop. I’ll focus on academia for now. He finishes his PhD in two years. They come back to Boston and he joins MIT as a junior professor at age 23. They stay one year in Boston. But Jim, even though he’s got a family, even though he is super successful as a young academic here because he’s got kids, he’s restless.\\n\\nOne of his buddies from the scooter trip to Bogota is from Bogota and lives there, his family’s there, has an idea to start a flooring tile manufacturing company. He’s like, the flooring at MIT and in Boston is so much nicer than in Bogota. We should start a company and make the same kind of flooring here.\\n\\nBen: When I read this, I couldn’t believe that this was Jim Simons’ first business venture. It’s so random, but it really is emblematic of just how much he was thrill-seeking and just looking for anything that was unexpected, different, exciting. He just gets bored fast.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Not just is this the start of his entrepreneurial career, the seeds of this financially is what goes on to start RenTech.\\n\\nBen: It’s wild.\\n\\nDavid: Totally wild. Jim takes a year off and goes down to Bogota.\\n\\nBen: This is a guy with an MIT undergrad and masters and a Berkeley PhD in theoretical math.\\n\\nDavid: Who’s now a professor at MIT.\\n\\nBen: Who is taking a year off to go work on a flooring company in Bogota.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, accurate. He does that for a year, they get it set up, he gets bored again. He is like, all right, I don’t want to just run this company. I’ve helped set it up. I have an ownership stake in it. Now, he bounces back to Boston, this time to Harvard as a professor there for a year.\\n\\nBen: He’s really racking them up.\\n\\nDavid: But he spends a year there and he’s like, ah, got the itch again. The junior professor’s salary isn’t that much. We said about him back from his childhood days, he sees the appeal in being rich. He’s like, this is not a path to being rich. He’s like, I’m going to go put my skills out on the open market.\\n\\nHe gets a job in Princeton, New Jersey, not at Princeton University, but at the Institute for Defense Analyses, which is a nonprofit organization that consults exclusively for the US government, specifically the Defense Department, and specifically the NSA. These are the civilian code breakers.\\n\\nBen: Yes. It was basically formed with this idea that: (1) across various branches of our government, we need better collaboration and cross funding of the same initiatives, and (2) there are going to be a lot of people who don’t work for the government that we’re going to want to hire to do some pretty secret work.\\n\\nDavid: The IDA there in Princeton functioned like the Institute for Advanced Study, which is also in Princeton. That’s where Einstein went when he came to America. An independent think tank research group, except it’s solely focused on code breaking and signal intelligence with the Russians during the Cold War.\\n\\nBen: It’s a pretty wild charter, and especially how special of an organization it was. The way these people would spend their time is part code breaking but part goofing around, because the creativity of mathematicians working together on passion projects is important to discovering clever new algorithms.\\n\\nDavid: This is so, so key, and this culture ends up getting translated whole cloth right into RenTech. The way IDA worked—I assume still works to this day—is they recruited top mathematicians and academics to come be codebreakers there. They would double their salaries…\\n\\nBen: And importantly, it couldn’t have been a government division if they were going to be doing that because there’s very specific congressionally-approved budgets for payroll.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. They figured out that they needed to attract the smartest people in the world who weren’t going to come just go work for the Department of Defense. This was the way to do it.\\n\\nLike you said, Ben, the charter of the group was that employees had to spend 50% of their time doing code breaking, but the other 50% of the time they were free to do whatever they wanted, like research, pursue whatever they were doing in academia, publish papers.\\n\\nThe appeal of going there was, hey, it’s the same thing as being a professor at MIT or Princeton or Harvard or whatever, except you’re doing code breaking instead of teaching, and there’s no bureaucracy to worry about, there’s no politics. It’s just, hey, you do your code breaking work, and then you publish. You can collaborate with your colleagues there.\\n\\nNow, this is pretty crazy. Very quickly after Jim arrives at IDA—remember he’s in money-making mode at this point in time—he recruits a bunch of his very brilliant colleagues to come work with him in their 50% free time on an idea to apply the same work and technologies that they’re using in code breaking and signal intelligence to trading in the stock market.\\n\\nThey come together and they publish a paper called Probabilistic Models for and Prediction of Stock Market Behavior. Everything that they suggest in this paper really is RenTech, just 20 years before RenTech.\\n\\nBen: It’s crazy. 1964 this was published?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Now at this point in time, fundamental analysis was then, as in most of the world today still is the primary way of investing in things of, hey, I know this company, I’m going to analyze their revenues, their price multiple, or I’m going to think about what’s happening in the currency markets or in the commodity markets and why copper is moving here, or the British pound is moving there and I’m going to invest on those insights.\\n\\nBen: You’re effectively looking at the intrinsic value of an asset, trying to assign it a value, and make investments based on that.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, fundamental investing. There also existed in the 60s technical investing, which is kind of voodoo. This is like I’m looking at a stock chart and I’ve got a feeling that it’s going to go up, like I’m tracing this pattern and it’s going up baby. Or no, no, no. This pattern is going down.\\n\\nBen: Using the phrase ‘technical’ might be a little generous. But what they’re looking for, basically trying to mine trading behavior for signal about the way that it will trade in the future rather than mining the intrinsic information about an asset for what you think it will do in the future.\\n\\nDavid: What Jim and his colleagues here are suggesting is that, but just not really done by humans. It’s that with a lot more data and a lot more sophisticated signal processing.\\n\\nBen: And importantly you might say, why is it this group of people that came to that conclusion of applying computational signal analysis to investing? Well, it’s effectively the same thing as code breaking. You are looking for signal in the noise, and trying to use computers and algorithms to mine signal from something that otherwise looks random.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. When Jim started working on code breaking, I think he just looked right back to his experience trading in the markets and was like, whoa, this is the same thing.\\n\\nBen: Which is not an insight other people had. That was the amazing thing about his background priming him to realize that.\\n\\nDavid: There’s all this noise in this data, and it is impossible for a human to sit here, look at this data, and say, oh, I know what the Soviets are saying. No, no, you have to use mathematical models and statistical analysis to extract the patterns.\\n\\nBen: So mathematical models, statistical analysis, we actually hear a lot of that in the world today because machine learning is a thing.\\n\\nDavid: What they are really doing here at IDA, and then soon in RenTech, is early machine learning. Jim just had this incredibly brilliant insight that you can use these techniques and this technology for making investments, which makes this the perfect time to talk about our presenting sponsor for this season, J.P. Morgan payments.\\n\\nBen: The finance industry has a rich history of innovating, dating all the way back to the literal renaissance, where double entry bookkeeping and letters of credit revolutionized global trade and economic development. J.P. Morgan payments really continues that tradition in their technology investments today.\\n\\nThey move $10 trillion a day securely. That is a quarter of all US dollar flows globally. Just think about the sheer volume of data at 5000 transactions per second and how important that is to the global economy.\\n\\nDavid: Unsurprisingly, J.P. Morgan payments has been in the AI game for years now. Similar to RenTech, they were also early to recognize the value of AI to gather process, and analyze those massive troves of data to provide solutions for their customers and mitigate risk, like when they incorporated AI into their cashflow forecasting tool, which helps businesses manage liquidity, and that proved especially valuable during the pandemic.\\n\\nBen: Also unsurprisingly, J.P. Morgan was ranked number one in a recent global banking index of AI capabilities with Fortune, saying they were “head and shoulders” above the others. Their customers get AI-powered payment solutions for fraud prevention, customer and treasury insights, all of which grows the bottom line. They can even analyze transaction data to predict and mitigate fraud patterns in real time with their validation services, helping stop millions of dollars for customers in attempted fraud.\\n\\nDavid: We were doing some research to prep for this segment and we came across something pretty wild. The United States Treasury Department has started using AI to detect suspected check fraud, and recovered over $375 million in 2023 utilizing the new tools. The US Treasury Department disperses trillions of dollars annually. If they continue to employ new technologies like this, it could really add up to the tune of billions.\\n\\nHow does this fit in? Well, the Treasury Department recently selected J.P. Morgan to provide account validation services for federal agencies. Obviously, payment integrity and this issue of improper payments is top of mind for them and at enormous scale. So whether you are one of the largest institutions in the world or a small business like us here at Acquired, J.P. Morgan offers you peace of mind and protection.\\n\\nBen: One more playbook theme in common between RenTech and J.P. Morgan payments, they both analyze data to uncover patterns and insights you may never think to look for.\\n\\nOne of their clients, a furniture store, discovered a correlation with customers who also shop at pet stores where shoppers spent 76% more than the average customer when this was the case. So the furniture store launched a line of pet-friendly furnishings for that audience. These are the insights that drive growth with J.P. Morgan payments as your partner.\\n\\nDavid: When it comes to payments technology, businesses of all sizes can benefit from having end-to-end AI-powered solutions that are constantly learning. And J.P. Morgan’s API first infrastructure across all aspects of treasury and payments is a one-stop shop solution.\\n\\nBen: To learn more, check out jpmorgan.com/acquired. And fun fact listeners, it is fraud prevention month, so listeners can learn even more by following at J.P. Morgan on LinkedIn.\\n\\nOkay, David, this paper is published. They’re going to trade and make a whole bunch of money in the stock market by applying this code-breaking, signal processing, data analysis approach to investing.\\n\\nDavid: Then the natural question is, okay, what is the model here? How are they going to do this? It turns out that one of the employees of IDA at this time, and one of the members of this sort of rebel group (shall we say) within the organization, is a guy named Lenny Baum. Lenny just happens to be the world expert in a mathematical concept called a Markov model, specifically a version of the Markov model called a hidden Markov model.\\n\\nNow, a Markov model is a statistical concept that’s used to model pseudo-random or chaotic situations. Basically it says, let’s abandon any attempt to actually understand what is going on in all of this data that we have. Instead, just focus on what are the observable states that we can see of the situation.\\n\\nCan we identify different states that the situation is in? If we just do that, can we predict future states based on what we’ve observed about the patterns of past states? The answer to that is usually yes, even if you don’t know anything about fundamentally how the system operates.\\n\\nBen: The great example that Greg Zuckerman gives in the book is…\\n\\nDavid: A baseball game.\\n\\nBen: There are three balls and two strikes. That state has a narrow set of states after it. It’s going to be a strikeout, they’re going to get on base, it’s going to be a walk, or maybe they foul it off and it keeps going. There’s only really a narrow set of things that could happen after that.\\n\\nWhereas when it’s zero balls and zero strikes, there’s a lot that could happen. They could just keep pitching. And if you don’t know the rules, you’re like, why do they just keep pitching?\\n\\nIt’s this great way to explain this idea of the black box that if nobody tells you the rules to the game by observing the outputs enough and observing, okay, in this state these outputs are possible, you actually can get pretty good at (at least) if not predicting, understanding the probability distribution of the outcomes for any given state in the game.\\n\\nDavid: We brought up machine learning and AI a minute ago. This is a foundational concept to modern day AI. If you think about large language models and predicting what comes next, it’s not like these large language models necessarily understand English. They’re just really, really good at predicting states and the next state, i.e., characters and the next character, or pixels and the next set of pixels or frame, et cetera.\\n\\nBen: Obviously, they’re much fancier than that, but that is the underpinning of it all. I remember in my sophomore year of college computer science class, I had a Markov chain assignment. It was basically write a Java program to ingest this public domain book, then I would give it a seed word, the first word of each sentence, and press return, return, return, return, return. It would scan through the probability tree and give me the most probable word based on the corpus of the book that it just read to create some sentence.\\n\\nIt feels like magic. Of course, in these early rudimentary Markov chain things like the one I did in college, it spits out nonsense. But that would evolve to be the LLMs that we know of today.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. That is what they were using at IDA to do codebreaking, and that’s what they propose in this paper that they could use in the stock market too.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. The way that this applies to investing is just like you might not know the rules of baseball, but if you’ve watched enough baseball, you can guess at what the probabilities of the next thing to happen are based on the state.\\n\\nInvesting’s kind of the same thing, or at least the stock market movements are, where you don’t know the future. You don’t know what’s going to happen. You don’t know if stock X affects stock Y in some way because you don’t know in what way those companies do business together or who holds both stocks. Are they overlapping investors? You don’t know the relationship between those companies, so you can’t forecast with 100% certainty of what is going to happen.\\n\\nHowever, if you suck in enough data about what has happened in the past and the probability distribution from every given state in the past, you probably could make some educated guesses or at least understand the probability of any individual outcome based on a state today of what could happen next.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Jim and Lenny and this whole little crew are pretty fired up. They’re like, oh, great, Let’s go raise a fund and invest in the markets using this strategy.\\n\\nBen: Certainly we’re going to be successful at raising that fund and certainly we’re going to be very profitable because we’ve got this great idea.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. What could go wrong? Well, in the mid 60s, the idea that some wonky academics at some random secretive agency in Princeton, New Jersey could go raise money, was non-viable.\\n\\nIt was hard enough for Warren Buffet to raise money at this point in time for his fund, and he was Benjamin Graham’s anointed, appointed disciple. And here are these academics who are working at some random, unknown non-profit, saying give us money. We don’t know anything about these companies that we’re going to invest in. We don’t know anything about fundamentals, but we’ve got a really good algorithm. People are probably like, what is an algorithm? So they just have no access to capital.\\n\\nBen: This was decades before it became high pedigree to come from a technical or computer science background in the world of investing.\\n\\nDavid: A bunch of Keystone Cops–style fundraising happens here. They’re going around in secret, trying to keep the IDA bosses from knowing what they’re doing. One of the group ends up leaving a copy of the investment prospectus on the copy machine at work one night. The boss discovers it, calls them all into his office, and is like, guys, what are you doing here?\\n\\nBen: It’s a little bit of a clown show on the operational side, even if the idea is good.\\n\\nDavid: So they end up abandoning the effort, both because they can’t raise money and because IDA has found out about this and they’re not too pleased. Shortly after all of this, though, Jim ends up moving on anyway because the Vietnam War starts and he, as you can imagine from his background, is not a supporter of the Vietnam War at this point in time.\\n\\nJim writes an op-ed in the New York Times denouncing the Vietnam War and saying like, yeah, he’s part of the defense department, but not everybody in the defense department is for the war.\\n\\nBen: Which is so naive thinking you can write an op-ed in the New York freaking times and that’s not going to create issues for you in your job.\\n\\nDavid: Even more than that, amazingly nobody really paid attention to it, except a reporter at Newsweek, who then comes to interview Jim and ask him some more questions and he just doubles down on this. When the Newsweek piece comes out, that’s when the Department of Defense is like, all right, you got to fire this guy.\\n\\nSo Jim gets fired in 1967, even though he’s a star codebreaker. He made supposedly huge contributions to the group, which are still classified, but at age 30 with a wife and three kids, he’s out on the street. Even though he’s super smart, his colleagues love him clearly, he’s now bounced out of MIT, he’s bounced out of Harvard, he’s gone to this seemingly final home for him, great place at IDA, he gets bounced out of there too. His job prospects are not great.\\n\\nHe takes pretty much the only halfway decent–paying job that he could get, which is to be the chair of the newly established or maybe reestablished Math Department at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, which is the Long Island campus of the State University of New York. This is not Harvard, this is not MIT.\\n\\nBen: No, it is not.\\n\\nDavid: But it did have one very important thing going for it, which is why Jim ended up there, and that is that Nelson Rockefeller, who was then the governor of New York, had launched a $100 million campaign to try and turn this Long Island campus of the State University of New York into a mathematical powerhouse, to become the Berkeley of the East. I thought MIT was the Berkeley of the East already, but Rockefeller is way too good a campaign that he wants Stony Brook to become a math and sciences powerhouse. And Jim is the key.\\n\\nHe wouldn’t be able to recruit somebody like Jim otherwise, but because he’s now tarnished his career, here’s a very talented mathematician that they can convince to become chair of the department. They basically give Jim an unlimited budget and leeway to go try and poach math professors from departments all over the country in the world and bring them there to Long Island.\\n\\nPart of how Jim goes and recruits folks is money. The old, hey, I’ll double your salary line. But the other part of it, too, is he’s given such leeway, and Stony Brook is so different from the politics of an MIT or a Harvard or a Princeton. He says, hey, come here. I’ll pay you more.\\n\\nBut even more importantly, you can just focus on your research. You’re not going to have to deal with committees. You’re not going to have to do all this stuff. There is none of this stuff here. You might have to teach a little bit, but that’s not even the point. Rockefeller doesn’t want this necessarily to become a great teaching institution. He just wants to assemble talent there.\\n\\nAmazingly it works. Jim starts getting a bunch of great talent, including James Ax, who is a superstar in algebra and number theory from Cornell, and he ends up at Stony Brook recruiting and building one of the best math departments in the world.\\n\\nBen: Amazing.\\n\\nDavid: Totally amazing. But in true Jim fashion, after a couple of years of this and also his marriage with Barbara falling apart, he starts getting restless again. He decides that he wants to go on a sabbatical, go back to Berkeley, reunite with his old advisor there, and go spend some time out on the coast in California.\\n\\nThis is where Chern and Simons end up collaborating and developing the Chern-Simons theory, that ends up winning the highest award in geometry from the American Mathematical Society, and really is Jim’s personal mark on mathematics.\\n\\nNow also right around the same time, remember the Colombian flooring company? It gets Acquired. Jim and his buddies who are partners in it, come into a good amount of money. Jim is newly divorced, he’s restless in academia, he has these ideas back from when he was at IDA about what you could do in the markets if you had capital. He starts trading again, and he gets more and more into it.\\n\\nMeanwhile, like we said, he is becoming disillusioned again and restless at academia. And in 1978, he leaves to focus full-time on trading, which is a huge shock to the academic community. Remember, he’s assembled this superstar team there at Stony Brook.\\n\\nThere’s a quote in Greg’s book from another mathematician at Cornell. “We looked down on him when he did this, like he had been corrupted and had sold his soul to the devil.”\\n\\nBen: It was really viewed in the math community as anyone who’s going to do investing is throwing away their talent. It wasn’t even that it was common the way that it is today.\\n\\nDavid: Jim was the first one, but the idea that you would leave to do anything commercial, you doing a disservice to humanity.\\n\\nBen: Exactly, and leaving to do anything, sure. But leaving to do investing was almost just seen as dirty, like it’s this rich person’s game that provides no value to society.\\n\\nDavid: I don’t think it was that the rest of the math world was skeptical that it could work. They probably were like, oh yeah, this could work. But they were like, eww.\\n\\nBen: Academics tend to be much more motivated by prestige than money, so I could totally see other people being like, oh, I could do that if I wanted, but I have this higher calling and everyone respects me for this higher calling. My currency is the papers I publish and the awards that I win, and that’s what I want.\\n\\nDavid: Now Stony Brook, we should say too, it’s a very nice place. But it’s in the middle of Long Island on the North Shore. This is not the Hamptons. It’s like the Long Island suburbs.\\n\\nBen: The wooded Long Island suburbs.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, the wooded Long Island suburbs. Here’s Jim in a strip mall next to a pizza joint, setting up his trading operation that he decides very cleverly to call Moneymetrics—a combination of money and metrics or econometrics. He recruits his old IDA buddy, original partner in crime on the trading idea, Lenny Baum, to come and join him. This time though, they have some capital from the sale of the flooring company.\\n\\nBen: How much did he make on that flooring sale?\\n\\nDavid: I think together with Jim, his partners, and whatever money Lenny put in, they had a little less than $4 million in this initial capital.\\n\\nBen: In 1978.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Now, Jim also has another advantage at this point in time, which is he’s right down the street from Stony Brook, and he’s just recruited all of these superstar mathematicians.\\n\\nBen: The table has been set.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and those folks are more loyal to Jim than they are to Stony Brook.\\n\\nBen: But they’re more loyal right now to academia than they are to finance. This is not a paved pathway until Jim paves this pathway.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, in general. But some of them, and in particular the superstar James Ax, Jim convinces to come join him in his trading operations.\\n\\nBen: So having Baum and Ax and Simons, it’s like suddenly this extremely credible team in the math world.\\n\\nDavid: Beyond credible.\\n\\nBen: All the theorems that a lot of mathematicians are using every day are all named after these three guys who are now at the same firm trading.\\n\\nDavid: And it’s led by Jim, who’s somebody that they respect as an academic, but even more important is somebody they want to work for, they look up to, and they think is cool. He’s out there being like, hey, I think we can make money.\\n\\nNow at this point, they’re primarily trading currencies, not stocks. Currencies are obviously large markets, but they aren’t impacted by as many signals and as many factors as stocks are, or really even slightly more complex commodities like soybeans or whatever.\\n\\nBen: And it seemed to me like a lot of the trading of currencies they were doing was basically based on feelings that they had around how a central bank was acting, like if the head of state of a certain country was going to do something or not. It’s basically like betting on how one single actor who was in control of currencies at governments would act. To your point about very few signals impacting price, it’s knowing what one person is going to do.\\n\\nDavid: And this is super important. At the end of the day, they build some models there. They’re getting the early versions, infrastructure, and scaffolding of this quantitative approach set up. But in terms of the actual trades they’re putting on, they’re still doing all of it by hand. And they’re still all really going on a fundamental type analysis.\\n\\nThey’ll take some signals from the model, they’ll see what’s interesting, what they spit out, but they’re not going to act on anything unless they can be like, oh yeah, I see what is going on here. I have a hypothesis.\\n\\nBen: The computers are by no means running loose at this point.\\n\\nDavid: By no means at all, yeah. They’re just suggesting patterns and ideas, and Jim, Lenny, and James have to then decide, hey, are we going to do this or not? Or are we going to do something just totally different that we think is what’s going to happen?\\n\\nThis actually does make sense, really for two reasons. One, computers and computing power just wasn’t sophisticated enough yet to really build AI in a way that’s powerful enough that it could work well enough, you could really trust it. That’s one part.\\n\\nThe other part is these folks are mathematicians. They’re not computer scientists. They’re really, really good at building models, decoding signals (obviously), but they’re much more from this realm of theory.\\n\\nI actually spoke with Howard Morgan who’s going to come up here in a second, and he made this point to me. He’s like, in math, there’s this concept of traceability that’s a really, really important cultural tenant. It’s like proving a proof, or proving a theorem, or something like that. You really need to understand why to get ahead in the field. It’s not like you can just say, oh, hey, the data suggests this. It’s like, no, no, no, you need proof.\\n\\nThat’s the world that these guys are coming from. They’re like, oh, we can use data to help us here, but ultimately we want to have a rock solid theory of what is fundamentally happening here.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating, which is very different from, we’ll cram a huge amount of data in, and then whatever the data suggests, we know it’s true because the data suggests it, which is where they would end up many years later once they had both the hardware you’re referring to—sophisticated computers—the clean data that would be required to make all of those incredibly numerous and fast calculations, and also the real computer engineering architecture to build these scale systems to actually act on large amounts of signals and understand them all to come up with results. They just didn’t have any of that at the time, so it was hunches and chalkboards.\\n\\nDavid: So much so that even Jim is ringleader here, he’s far from convinced that he should put all of his wealth into this thing. He’s like, ah, yeah, this is interesting. We’re building, we’re experimenting. Great. But I also want to put my money somewhere else, too, for some diversification.\\n\\nThis is where Howard Morgan comes in. We used to talk about this on old Acquired episodes that in the early days of Silicon Valley, there were only 10 people out here. They all knew each other and they were all doing the same thing. This was also the case in East Coast finance and technology, and early VC in these days. Howard Morgan would go on to be one of the co-founders of First Round Capital.\\n\\nBen: Which was essentially spun out of Renaissance? It was the venture capital work that they were doing at Renaissance that didn’t fit with the rest of Renaissance?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Here’s how it all went down, and this is so poorly understood out there. Howard was a computer science and business school professor at the University of Pennsylvania. He taught CS at Penn and business at Wharton.\\n\\nHe had been involved in bringing ARPANET to Penn and was early, early internet pioneer. As a result, he was super plugged into tech, early startups, and really early, early proto internet stuff. Jim gets excited about investing together with Howard. They say like, hey, maybe we should partner together.\\n\\nIn 1982, Jim actually winds down Moneymetrics, and he and Howard co-found a new firm together that’s going to reflect both of their backgrounds and be a great diversification. Jim and his group are going to bring in the quantitative trading thing,\\n\\nBen: And again, trading on currencies and commodities at this point.\\n\\nDavid: And Howard’s going to bring in private company technology investing. They pick a name for a firm that is going to reflect this—Renaissance Technologies.\\n\\nBen: It’s crazy.\\n\\nDavid: And that is why RenTech is called RenTech.\\n\\nBen: When we figured this out in the research, I could not believe that this is not a more widely understood story. That this is the origins of what is today a fantastic venture capital firm (First Round Capital), but you could not name two more different strategies in investing.\\n\\nA long-term illiquid thing like venture capital, highly speculative, versus we’re going to trade whether we think the French Franc is going to go up or down tomorrow based on the whim of some government leader. It’s unbelievable these were under the same roof.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. But when you know the whole background in history, it makes sense because this is their personal money. This is Jim and his buddies, Lenny, James, and Howard. There’s no institutional capital here. They’re not out pitching LPs of like, oh, you should invest in my diversified strategy of currency trading and private technology startups.\\n\\nBen: When they say multi-strategy, this is really multi-strategy.\\n\\nDavid: We’ll get into what multi-strategy today means later. But in these early days of RenTech, 50% of the portfolio was venture capital and 50% was currency trading. In fact, a couple of years after they get started, the currency trading side of the firm almost blows up when Lenny goes super long on government bonds and the market goes against him and the whole portfolio drops 40%, which is wild. That ends up triggering a clause in Lenny’s agreement with Jim, and they sell off Lenny’s entire portfolio and he leaves the firm. This is crazy. Blow up risk is always an issue in the markets, but this happened to RenTech.\\n\\nBen: And because we quickly got to this point in the story, it would be easy to say, well that’s a clause that has a lot of teeth. There were many rumbles of something like this potentially happening. Simons going to Lenny and saying, hey, maybe we should cut some of our losses and it’s okay to trade out of these positions. Lenny was just very dug in on I’m a true believer. That’s how you can get into a situation where you trigger a covenant like this.\\n\\nDavid: And again, also shows they weren’t doing model-based quantitative trading really at this point in time.\\n\\nBen: So much gut.\\n\\nDavid: As a result of that, for a while RenTech is truly almost entirely a venture capital firm. One point on the venture side, just one investment, Franklin Dictionaries, do you remember Ben? The Franklin electronic dictionaries? Yeah. That was one of their biggest investments. That one investment is half of Jim’s net worth at this low point for the trading side.\\n\\nBen: I had no idea. That’s crazy.\\n\\nDavid: In the book, Greg talks about, oh, Jim was focused on venture capital, and that’s the story out there. It’s like, well, he was focused on venture capital because that was the only thing working and making money.\\n\\nBen: It’s the only thing where they actually had an edge from Howard’s access to deal flow, because They certainly didn’t have an edge in the global currency markets.\\n\\nDavid: I think perhaps in part because of the trading losses, James Ax starts to get a little disillusioned too, and he tells Jim that he wants to move out to California with Sandor Straus, who started working with them at this point—Sandor was another Stony Brook alum that joined them—and the two of them want to move out to California and do trading out there.\\n\\nJim says, sure, fine. I’m here with Howard. I’m doing venture capital stuff. Why don’t you go move out to California? You can start your own firm, which they do—it’s called Axcom—and we’ll contract with Axcom to run what’s left of the trading operations here for RenTech.\\n\\nBen: It’s this interesting arm’s length thing where Jim strikes a deal where he’s going to own a part of Axcom in exchange for this very favorable contractual relationship where they’re going to hire them to be the manager for this pot of money that Renaissance has raised. But it’s technically not Renaissance. It’s Axcom.\\n\\nDavid: It’s another company that is now doing the quantitative trading.\\n\\nBen: And I think Jim owned a quarter of it, is that right?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, that’s right.\\n\\nBen: And importantly, I don’t think anyone had any idea what Axcom would become or how unbelievably profitable it would be.\\n\\nDavid: Nobody would’ve done what they did had they known what was coming.\\n\\nBen: Wouldn’t have spun it out.\\n\\nDavid: Once Ax and Straus get out to California, Straus is on the computing data infrastructure side. That’s what he was doing at Stony Brook, and that’s what he came into Renaissance to build. He starts getting really into data, and he starts collecting intraday pricing movements on securities.\\n\\nAt this point in time, I think really the best data you could get from providers out there was maybe open and close data on securities pricing. Straus finds a way to get tick data, like every 20 minute data on these securities throughout the day.\\n\\nBen: Not only that. He’s getting historical data that predates what your traditional data providers would give you, then ingesting it into computers and cleaning the data to get it into the same format as the tick data. He’s getting early 1900 even 1800 stuff to try to just say at some point, hopefully we’ll be able to make use of this, and I want to have this just really, really clean data set about the way that these markets interact.\\n\\nDavid: He’s doing ETL on the data (I think) before anybody knew what ETL was.\\n\\nBen: Again, no one told him to do that. That was just a self-motivated, almost obsession of, well, if we’re going to have data, it should be well-formatted, well-understood, labeled and all that.\\n\\nDavid: So that’s one thing that happens. The other thing is Jim says, oh, you’re going out to California. Let me hook you up with my buddy who’s a Berkeley professor out there, Elwyn Berlekamp. Berlekamp had studied with folks like John Nash and Claude Shannon at MIT.\\n\\nBen: I love that Claude Shannon is coming in again.\\n\\nDavid: I know.\\n\\nBen: We talked about a lot on the Qualcomm episode, father of Information Theory, really the center of gravity for attracting tons of talent to MIT, and paving the way for what would become phone technology and telecommunications broadly in the future. But the fact that Berlekamp is crossing paths at MIT with Claude Shannon, so cool.\\n\\nDavid: So cool. Most importantly for this specific use case, Berlekamp had worked with John Kelly who developed the Kelly Criterion on bet sizing, which poker players will likely be well familiar with.\\n\\nWith this combination now of much, much, much better and deeper data from Straus, and Berlekamp coming in and working with Ax on the models and saying, hey, we should be smart about the bet sizing that we’re doing in the trades that are coming out of these models, versus I don’t know what they were doing before. Maybe it was naive of every trade was the same, or we should actually be systematic about this. The models start really working.\\n\\nBen: This is the turning point.\\n\\nDavid: In these mid-80s years, Axcom is generating IRRs of 20+ percent on the trading side. Not necessarily going to beat venture capital IRRs, but liquid, reliable…\\n\\nBen: Well, that’s the thing. They don’t know how reliable yet. They know they’ve done it a few years in a row here, but the question is how uncorrelated to the stock market over a long period of time and how predictable are these returns? Or is it just super high variance?\\n\\nDavid: But the early results are really good, and Jim and Berlekamp (especially) are very encouraged by this. In 1988, Jim and Howard Morgan decide to spin out the venture investments, and Howard goes to manage those with basically their own money.\\n\\nFun coda on this. When Howard starts first round a number of years later with Josh Kopelman, Jim of course is a large LP. Howard, of course, remains an investor in RenTech.\\n\\nThe first institutional fund, that first round ended up raising, was a 50X on $125 million fund. It had Roblox, Uber, and Square. I believe this is right. I think Jim made as much money from his investments in first round as Howard did from his LP stake in RenTech.\\n\\nBen: That’s wild.\\n\\nDavid: Isn’t that amazing?\\n\\nBen: Wow. That is an untold story about Jim Simons. I think I read basically every primary source thing on Jim or Renaissance on the whole internet, but I assume you got that from Howard.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. It was super fun talking to Howard about this, and just the history of how First Round started at early super angel investing and everything that became.\\n\\nBen: I also didn’t realize that First Round’s Fund I was a 50X on $125 million fund.\\n\\nDavid: First institutional fund, which I believe they called Fund II.\\n\\nBen: Wild, wild stuff.\\n\\nDavid: Totally wild. When Howard spins out the venture activities, Jim then decides to set up a new fund as a joint venture between RenTech and Axcom. They decide to name it after all of the collective mathematical awards that Jim, James, Berlekamp, and all these prestigious mathematicians have won in their careers. They name it the Medallion fund.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, we’ve arrived. This is the part of the story that matters. The Medallion fund is the crown jewel, or you might even say, actually the only interesting thing about Renaissance, and it is born out of this observation that, oh my God, what they’re doing over there at Axcom is really interesting. Maybe they shouldn’t be doing it all the way over there. Maybe that should be a deeper part of the fold here at RenTech and we shouldn’t have let that get away, or frankly given up on the quantitative trading strategies too early.\\n\\nAnd again, still just currencies, still just commodities futures, not playing the stock market at all. But the seeds and the ideas, the huge amount of clean data, the robust engineering infrastructure to process all that data, the mining of signals from data to figure out what trading strategies to execute, that is really starting to form here in this new joint venture, this Medallion fund.\\n\\nDavid: Those ideas had all existed before. This is the first time that it’s all brought together, and actually working and operationalized.\\n\\nBen: And frankly, that computers got good enough to actually do it, too. That’s another big piece of this.\\n\\nDavid: I don’t know that Straus could have done his data engineering too much earlier in time. But before we get into the just absolutely insane run that this Medallion fund is about to go on, that continues right through to this day, now is the perfect time for another story about ServiceNow. ServiceNow is one of our big partners here in season 14 and is just an incredible company.\\n\\nBen: ServiceNow digitally transforms your enterprise, helping automate processes, improve service delivery, and increase operational efficiency all in one intelligent platform. Over 85% of the Fortune 500 runs on them, and they have quickly joined the Microsofts and the NVIDIAs as one of the most important enterprise software companies in the world today.\\n\\nDavid: We talked on our Novo Nordisk episode about how ServiceNow founder, Fred Luddy, discovered this core insight that software can transform and eliminate manual tasks. And on Hermes, we told the story of how current CEO Bill McDermott came in and turbocharged that into an absolute monster $150 billion market cap global behemoth.\\n\\nThe key thread that connects those two eras is that from day one, Fred knew the ServiceNow platform could be used across the whole enterprise. But at the same time, he also knew from his decades of prior software experience that launching a broad, horizontal offering right out of the gate as a startup was a recipe for failure. You need to start with a specific vertical use case. And in this case, he chose IT service management.\\n\\nBen: And that’s been true for us here on Acquired, too. David, if we didn’t name it Acquired and cover technology acquisitions that actually went well, we never could have broadened and become the podcast that tells the stories of great companies. You can’t just start as that.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: This is what’s so cool and where I think the playbook lesson really is for listeners, because you can’t just pick any use case. You have to be strategic about it. IT was the perfect vertical because every other department has to interface with them from the CEO on down.\\n\\nThey’re going to notice when IT’s service management rapidly improves. All of those support tickets that used to take forever are now just magically resolved. That greases the wheels for the other departments to say, hey, maybe we should adopt ServiceNow to turbocharge and digitally transform our service levels, too.\\n\\nDavid: Once those other departments do pull the trigger on joining the ServiceNow platform, who is in charge of rolling it out for them? Of course, it’s IT who are already true ServiceNow believers.\\n\\nI’m honestly not sure that there’s a better enterprise software playbook in history than ServiceNow’s. Once they established the beachhead in IT, they then took the same platform to HR with employee experience, they took it to CSM with customer service requests, they took it to finance with regulatory reporting, audit and expense approvals, and now they’re adding AI, which will take everything to the next level.\\n\\nBen: If you want to learn more about the ServiceNow platform and playbook, and hear how it can transform your business, head on over to servicenow.com/acquired. When you get in touch, just tell them that Ben and David sent you.\\n\\nDavid: So they’ve got this grand new plan and vision with the Medallion fund. Unfortunately, right out of the gate, the fund stumbles a bit, and Ax ends up getting burned out. Berlekamp though is like, no, no, no, no. This is an anomaly. Like we’re going to fix this. I really, really believe that what we’re doing with these models is going to be extremely profitable.\\n\\nHe buys out most of Ax’s stake in the summer of 1989, and he moves the offices up to Berkeley. There he comes up with the idea that, hey, we should trade more frequently, a lot more frequently, because if what we’re trying to do is understand the state of the market from the data we have and then predict the future state of the market, and then combine that with figuring out the right bet sizing to make. We actually want to make a lot more trades to get a lot more data points, and learn a lot more about the bets we’re making so that we can then size them up or size them down.\\n\\nBen: It’s that, and it’s two other things. One is the further into the future you look, the less certain you can be about it. If you know something is worth $10 right now, what you know five minutes from now is it’s probably going to be worth about $10. The most likely situation is it’s within 5% of that. If you ask me three years from now, I have almost no intuition about that. A state machine is the same way. If you flash forward a whole bunch of states, you lose predictability as you continue down that chain.\\n\\nThe second thing is, if your models are showing that you’re going to be right, call it something like 50.25% of the time, then the amount of money you can make is gated by the number of bets you can make at a quarter percent edge.\\n\\nIf I walk up to the casino and I think I’m right about this particular roulette wheel, which of course you’re not 50.25% of the time, and I decide to play once or play twice or play five times, there’s a chance I could lose all my money. Or if I have tiny little bet sizes, then I’m just not going to make that much money. But if I walk up to said game with a little bit of edge, and I use small bet sizes, and I play 10,000 times, I’m going to walk out with a lot of money.\\n\\nDavid: There is a great Bob Mercer quote about this later. He says, “We are right 50.75% of the time.”\\n\\nBen: And I do think he’s making up that number. I think it’s illustrative.\\n\\nDavid: But we’re 100% right, 50.75% of the time. You can make billions that way.\\n\\nBen: It’s so true. When you have that little edge, it’s about making sure that you’re not betting so much, that a few bets that don’t break your way can take you down to zero and to make sure you can just play the game a lot.\\n\\nDavid: A lot, yes. And then back to the Kelly criterion, adjust your bet sizes over time as you’re making those bets.\\n\\nBen: Now of course, this is all great in the abstract. If it’s that you’re literally sitting at a casino, you’re somehow perfectly making these bets, and you’re just sitting right there at the table and then you can walk over to the cashier. It gets a little bit different in the market.\\n\\nFor example, there are real transaction costs, especially at this point in history, before some of these more innovative trading business models with pay for order flow and zero transaction fees and all this stuff. There are real transaction costs to putting on these trades. And of course you’re going to move the market when you put on these trades.\\n\\nDavid: This is slippage.\\n\\nBen: There are all sorts of practical consideration. You could get front run by other people. It’s not just a computer program that gets executed. You actually have to meet the constraints of the real world when you’re deciding instead of a few big bets, we’re going to have a hundred thousand tiny bets.\\n\\nDavid: And as time goes on and the whole quant industry emerges and becomes much more sophisticated, I think it’s particularly the slippage there that becomes the governor on how high velocity you can actually be on this. And the slippage is that once you are at a certain scale, you are going to move the market with your trades.\\n\\nBen: So the deeper you get into the order book, like let’s say you want to buy $5 million of something, maybe your first $100,000 you’re pretty sure you can get the quoted price, but by your last $100,000 of that $5 million buy, the price might have gotten pretty different already.\\n\\nDavid: We’re going to come back to this in just a minute, but this certainly for early RenTech, and then even now still for all of quantitative finance, is a really, really, really important thing.\\n\\nBen: And David, in a very crude way, calls back to last episode on Hermes, the idea that the price would be highest for the family member that is willing to sell now and goes down over time. If the family was going to sell to Bernard Arnault, it would behoove you to be first in the order book, not last in the order book.\\n\\nDavid: I feel like there’s this meta lesson that I’ve been learning through Acquired and my own personal investing over the past couple of years. Every market is dependent on supply and demand. You can see quoted valuations and quoted price streams, but oftentimes that’s the mistake of just looking at averages.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. Looking at the quoted price of an asset is wrong. You actually should be looking at what is the volume that is willing to buy and what is the volume that is willing to sell. And for all of those buyers and all of those sellers, what is the price at which they’re willing to transact?\\n\\nThe way that tends to manifest on a stock chart is here’s the price of the share right now. But that’s not actually what’s going on under the surface. It’s a whole bunch of buyers and sellers who have different willingness to pay and have different amounts that they’re trying to buy or sell.\\n\\nDavid: Now, at this point in time, when the Medallion fund is first starting to work in (say) late 1989, early 1990, it’s small enough that this isn’t a big consideration yet. Medallion was about $27 million under management when Berlekamp bought out Ax. In 1990 the first full year after that, the fund gains 77.8% gross, which, after fees and carry was 55% net. Now, what were the fees and carry?\\n\\nBen: Either one of those numbers is shooting the freaking lights out, assuming that this is not a crazy high risk strategy that they executed and will completely fall apart under different market conditions. If this is an actual repeatable strategy that produces the numbers you just said, unbelievable. World-changing.\\n\\nDavid: Hell yeah, let’s go. And indeed it was a ‘hell yeah, let’s go’ situation.\\n\\nBen: The numbers you quoted me, the gross and the net, sounded quite different. Talk to me about the fees and carry.\\n\\nDavid: Carry, I’ve seen different sources of whether it was 20% or 25% in the early days. But the management fee on the fund was 5%, which is crazy. The top venture capital firms in the world charge a 3% management fee, and even that is like everybody holds their nose and are like, this is ridiculous. How on earth were these nobodies charging a 5% management fee out the gate to their investors? Well, a couple of things. One, their investors were not sophisticated. It was mostly their own money and their buddy’s money.\\n\\nBen: So they set that precedent.\\n\\nDavid: They set that precedent. But two, though, they actually needed the money. Straus’ infrastructure costs were about $800,000 a year. So they just backed into the management fee based on like, hey, we need $800,000 a year to run the infrastructure, plus we need some money to pay folks and whatnot. Great, 5% management fee.\\n\\nBen: And the pitch they’re making to the investor base is like, if you believe that we should be able to massively outperform the market doing quantitative trading, well we’re going to need a lot of fees to do that. So the investors basically took the deal if they thought about it enough.\\n\\nOkay, so that’s the fees. On the performance, that 20% or 25%, it’s just not actually that far above market, if it’s above market at all. What you’re seeing is a high fee, normal-ish performance fee fund at this point in time.\\n\\nDavid: High management fee, normal-ish carrier performance element.\\n\\nAt the end of 1990, Simons is so jazzed about what’s going on that he tells Berlekamp, hey, you should move here to Long Island. Let’s recentralize everything here. I want to go all in on this. I think with some tweaks, we can be up 80% after fees next year.\\n\\nBerlekamp is a little more circumspect. (a) He wants to stay in Berkeley, he doesn’t have any desire to move to Long Island, and (b) I couldn’t tell how much of this is just, he’s a little more conservative than Jim, or how much of this actually might be his, hey, whole poker bet sizing thing.\\n\\nHe turns to Jim and he says, well, if you’re so optimistic, why don’t you buy me out? So Jim does at 6X the basis that Berlekamp had paid Ax a year earlier.\\n\\nBen: On the one hand, making a 6X in one year sounds great.\\n\\nDavid: On the other hand, this is the equivalent of when Don Valentine sold Sequoia’s Apple stake before the IPO to lock in a great gain, but miss out on all the upside to come.\\n\\nBen: David, I think we should throw this out so people understand the volume of this. They’ve generated on the order of $60 billion of performance fees for the owners of the fund over their entire lifetime. On the one hand, 6X in a year isn’t bad. On the other hand, you owned a giant part of something that has dividend $60 billion in cash out to its owners.\\n\\nDavid: That’s just on the carry side. The owners are the principles. So just like dollars out of the firm, it’s probably twice that. I would estimate probably $150–$200 billion that have come out of Medallion over the last 35 years.\\n\\nJim buys out Berlekamp, he rolls everything in the Medallion fund back into RenTech itself, moves everything back to Stony Brook, Straus moves to Stony Brook.\\n\\nBen: So it’s now the Jim Simons show in New York, with Straus building the engineering systems, and Ax (I think) still had a small stake.\\n\\nDavid: That’s right. And Straus had a stake as well. Once Jim takes control and moves everything back, he basically decides that he’s going to turn RenTech into an even better, even more idealized version of IDA and the math department at Stony Brook. He’s going to make this an academic’s paradise, where if you are one of the absolute smartest mathematicians or systems engineers in the world, this is where you want to be.\\n\\nOf course he starts raiding the Stony Brook department itself again. This is when Henry Laufer joins full-time. Laufer had been consulting with Medallion in the early days and working with Berlekamp as they’re doing bet sizing as they’re making more frequent trades. But now, once the whole operation is moved back to Long Island Laufer’s like, oh, okay, great. I’ll come full time. I’m here at Stony Brook anyway. This is way more fun than teaching.\\n\\nBen: And listeners, I imagine this is probably the point where you’re starting to get confused and saying, there are so many people in this story. I think we’re on eight or nine. We just keep introducing more people.\\n\\nThat is the story of Renaissance. It is not this singular clean narrative. It is a very complex reality of a whole bunch of different people that came in and out at different eras, where the firm was trying different things, and eventually became phenomenally successful with a very particular approach. But while they were figuring it out along the way, it took a lot of people.\\n\\nDavid: And just a lot of time, too. This is 25 years, this is a quarter century. From the time that Baum and Simons write the paper at IDA until Medallion really starts to work. It takes a long time.\\n\\nBen: And we haven’t even introduced the two people who would become the co-CEOs of this company for 20 years.\\n\\nDavid: Well, let’s get to that. So Jim moves everything back to Long Island, sets it up as this academic paradise, is recruiting the smartest people in the world. In 1991, the next year, the firm does 54.3% gross returns and 39.4% net returns after fees. Not Jim’s bogey of 80%, but still pretty freaking great.\\n\\nBen: We should say the years of modest performance are behind them. From every single year forward, they shoot the lights out. From 1990 onward, they never lose money. And on a gross basis, they never even do less than 30%. It’s working, it’s going. The whole rest of the story is about, hold on, keep the machine working, and we’re on the train.\\n\\nDavid: The historic run has begun, let’s just say. So 1992 gross returns are 47%, 1993, they’re 54%. At the end of 1993, Simons decides to close the fund and not allow new LPs in. If you’re an existing LP, you can stay in, but they’re no longer open for new inflows. He has so much confidence in what they’re doing that he thinks they’re all going to make more money without accepting new capital by just keeping it to the existing investor base.\\n\\n1994 gross returns are 93 freaking percent. Medallion at this point is stacking up cash. It is a meaningful fund. It’s about $250 million total at this point in time, which is small, but we’re talking about 1994 with a bunch of outsiders and academics that have managed to amass a quarter billion dollars here. People start to pay attention.\\n\\nBen: And the performance fees on this are $7 million, $13 million, $52 million. The free cash flow flowing to partners here is certainly becoming real too.\\n\\nDavid: But as they get into that—call it on the order of magnitude of a billion dollar scale—they start bumping into the moving markets problem and the slippage that we were talking about earlier.\\n\\nBen: And that’s in the mid-90s?\\n\\nDavid: Yup. As they’re hitting this $250 million–$½ billion scale.\\n\\nBen: The computer model spits out, we should go buy this huge amount of something at this price. They go to do it, they can only buy 10%, 20%, 30% of the amount they want at that price, and then suddenly the price is very different.\\n\\nDavid: Up to this point, the vast majority of what Medallion is doing is trading currencies and commodities, not equities. Because you might be thinking, okay, yeah, I hear you. The 90s was a different era, but a $½ billion fund doesn’t sound that big. How are they moving markets with $½ billion?\\n\\nBen: It’s not the equity markets.\\n\\nDavid: It’s because they’re in these thinner markets. It’s not that commodities and futures are small markets. They’re large, but they’re thin compared to equities. There’s just not that much volume, and you just can’t trade that much without slippage becoming a huge issue. And Medallion is now hitting that limit.\\n\\nSimons decides the only thing we can do here to expand—which I’m such a believer in what we’re doing, we need to expand—is we need to move into equities. Equities are the holy grail. If we can make this work there, the depth in those markets will let us scale way, way, way bigger than we are now. And there’s so much more data about equities, pricing that we can feed into our models and the signal processing that we can do in the signals that we can find are going to be even better.\\n\\nBen: There are so many buyers and sellers every day showing up to trade so many different companies at such high velocity. It’s almost this honeypot for Renaissance’s systems. This is their moment. This is what they were built for. And it’s funny that they’ve just been in kid glove land the whole time with these thinly-traded markets with minimal data.\\n\\nDavid: This brings us to Peter Brown and Bob Mercer. In 1993, one of the mathematicians that Jim had recruited to RenTech, a guy named Nick Patterson, gets especially passionate about going out and recruiting new talent along with Jim. And this is (I think) one of the keys to RenTech and the culture there. People want other smart people to come be there, too. Nick sitting there like, this is a joy. I want to go find other best people in the world to hang out with.\\n\\nHe had read in the newspaper that IBM was going through cost-cutting and was about to do layoffs. He also knew that the speech recognition group at IBM had some absolutely fantastic mathematical talent. Really what they were doing was, again, another vector in the early AI machine learning research, specifically IBM’s Deep Blue chess project of the time had come out of this group. Peter Brown there was the one that actually spearheaded the project.\\n\\nBen: It’s interesting that you talk about speech recognition as the perfect fit for what they were doing. You might say, why is that? Well, the actual work that goes into speech recognition, natural language processing is kind of the same signal processing that Renaissance is doing to analyze the market.\\n\\nDavid: It’s not just kind of. It’s exactly the same signal processing.\\n\\nBen: Speech recognition is a hidden Markov process where the computer that’s listening to the sounds to try to turn it into language doesn’t actually know English, right? Obviously. But what it does know is when I hear this set of frequencies and tonalities and sounds, there’s a limited set of likely things that could come after it.\\n\\nIn Greg’s book, he greatly points out this perfect example. When I say apple, you might say pie. The probability that pie is going to be the next word following apple is significantly higher, so these people who have spent their careers not only doing the math and the theoretical computer science behind speech recognition to help figure out and predict the next words that you have a narrow set of likely words to choose from, so when you’re listening to those frequencies, you can say it’s probably going to be one of these three, rather than search the entire dictionary for any word that it could be to narrow the processing power. It’s not only the theoretical side, but it’s also people who have built those systems at IBM, like a real operational computer company.\\n\\nDavid: At operational scale. This is what’s so important and why the two of them become probably the most critical hires in RenTech’s history, even including all the great academics that came before them, because they’re good on the math side, but they have this large systems experience.\\n\\nJim and Nick know that if they’re going to move into equities, because of the volume of data and because of how much more complex that market is, they need more complex systems. And the current talent at RenTech coming from academia has just never experienced that or built anything like it.\\n\\nBen: The world that they’re entering is just exploding in complexity and dimensionality. When I say that, here’s what I mean. The data that they are mining, that they’re looking for is this intraday tick data between every stock trading. They’re trying to map the relationship between one stock and every other stock, not just at that moment in time, but every time before and every time after it.\\n\\nThey’re also, once they do identify patterns, which this is key, the algorithms identify the patterns. It’s not a human with a hunch saying, I think when oil prices go up, the airline prices are going to get hit. It’s computers doing machine learning to discover the patterns in the data.\\n\\nThen there’s the second piece of, well, what trades do you actually put on to be profitable from the probabilities that you just discovered? All these weights of relationships between all of these different companies.\\n\\nYou’re not just putting on one trade, you’re putting on 10, 100, thousands of simultaneous trades both to hedge, to be able to isolate some particular variable that you’re looking for—again, not you, but a computer is looking for—and you also need to do it in such specific bite sizes so that you don’t move the market.\\n\\nYou’re looking for a super multi-variate, multi-dimensional problem, both on the data ingestion side and on the how-do-I-actually-react-to-it side. All of this computation can’t take a long time because you must act, not in milliseconds. It’s not a high frequency trading that’s front running the market. That’s not actually what they do. A lot of people think it is, but we’ll get to that later. But they do need to act with reasonable quickness probably in the order of minutes. So these need to be really efficient computer systems too.\\n\\nDavid: And the universe of equities is so much more multidimensional and interrelated. There are only so many currencies in the world, and there are especially only so many currencies that are large enough trading markets that you can operate in. There’s not infinite, but thousands and thousands of equities in the world that are deep enough markets that you can operate in. And to some degree they’re all correlated with one another.\\n\\nBen: And just keep adding layers of complexity here. Keep adding new things to multiply by. Many of these are traded on multiple exchanges. So you might also be looking for pricing disparities on the same equity on different markets at different points in time. There are just dimensions upon dimensions of things to analyze, correlate, and act upon.\\n\\nDavid: So Patterson and Simons go raid IBM. They’re like Steve Jobs raiding Xerox Parc. They bring Peter, Bob, and one of their programming colleagues, David Magerman over from IBM into RenTech, and they get started on building the equities model.\\n\\nBut it turns out they’re obviously very successful at that, but the impact that they have and what they build is even bigger because Bob and Peter realized that, hey, actually we should just have one model for everything here. For currencies, for commodities, for equities, everything is correlated. Everything is a signal.\\n\\nIt’s not like the equities market is wholly independent and separate from what’s happening in currencies or what’s happening in commodities. There are relationships everywhere. We really want just one model. This is like a fantastical undertaking, especially in the early- to mid-90s.\\n\\nBen: But if you can nail it, it means that you can do interesting things like, hey, we don’t have a lot of data on this particular market, but it looks a lot like something we do have data on, so if it’s all part of the same model, we can just apply all the learnings from this other thing onto this brand new thing that we’re looking at with little data for the first time. And because we’re putting it all in one model and no one else in the world is, we can discover patterns that no one else knows about.\\n\\nDavid: It turns out that this was actually the second most important innovation that Bob and Peter bring to RenTech, the actual product and performance of having one model.\\n\\nThe most important thing is that if you have only one model, one infrastructure, everybody in the firm is working on that same model. You can all collaborate all together, which is especially important when you have the smartest people in the entire world all in one building.\\n\\nBefore this, there were separate models within RenTech. Insights, innovations, and work that one team was doing on one model wouldn’t get applied or translate over to work that was happening by another team on another model.\\n\\nBen: They did have the cultural element where it was encouraged that you share your learnings, but someone would have to take the time during their lunch break and go learn from you about those and then implement it in their version. There’s a lag and it may actually not get implemented.\\n\\nDavid: This is wholly unique and revolutionary. No other at-scale investment firm, period, and especially quant firm operates this way today with just one model. Their portfolio managers, teams, and multi-strategy people are culturally competitive with one another, but even if they’re not, the work that you’re doing on this side of Citadel is not impacting the work that you’re doing on that side of Citadel. What Bob and Peter do is they unify everything at RenTech, so all the wood is going behind one arrow.\\n\\nBen: And before we talk about the impact of that, we want to thank our longtime friend of the show, Vanta, the leading trust management platform. Vanta, of course, automates your security reviews and compliance efforts, so frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance and monitoring, which is quite topical if you are in the heavily regulated finance industry and you need a lot of security and compliance. Vanta takes care of these otherwise incredibly time- and resource training–efforts for your organization and makes them fast and simple.\\n\\nDavid: Vanta is the perfect example of the quote that we talk about all the time here on Acquired—Jeff Bezos, his idea that a company should only focus on what actually makes your beer taste better, i.e., spend your time and resources only on what’s actually going to move the needle for your product and your customers, and outsource everything else that doesn’t.\\n\\nIn RenTech’s case, this would be the model. Every company needs compliance and trust with their vendors and customers. It plays a major role in enabling revenue because customers and partners demand it, but yet it adds zero flavor to your actual product.\\n\\nBen: Vanta takes care of all of it for you. No more spreadsheets, no fragmented tools, no manual reviews to cobble together your security and compliance requirements. It is one single software pane of glass, just like one model that connects to all of your services via APIs and eliminates countless hours of work for your organization.\\n\\nThere are now AI capabilities to make this even more powerful, and they even integrate with over 300 external tools.

Peter and Bob come in in 1993, and 1994–1995 they’re building this. RenTech is getting into equities.\\n\\nBen: Just imagine the computers that you were using during 1994 and 1995. It is astonishing the level of computational complexity, coordination, and results that they are pulling off, again in real time, analyzing these markets with the technology that was available during those years.\\n\\nDavid: Here’s what’s amazing. Returns go down maybe slightly, certainly a bit from the blowout year that 1994 was, but they’re still above 30% every single year, most years above 40%.\\n\\nThis is unbelievable that they’re maintaining this performance as they’re going into this hugely more complex market, and they’re scaling assets under management. By the end of the 1990s, Medallion has almost $2 billion in assets under management while maintaining roughly the same performance by getting into equities. This is huge.\\n\\nBen: And David, if you just look at this and do the math, okay, so 94, their AUM was $276 million and they grew 93%. Then their AUM the next year was $462 million and then they grew 52%. Then their AUM the next year was $637 million. You quickly get where I’m going here, which is, oh, they’re scaling AUM not by bringing in new investors.\\n\\nDavid: It’s closed to new investors.\\n\\nIt’s all just compounding. This is the same capital that they had in 1993 that has gone from $122 million at the beginning of that year to 1999 being $1.5 billion.\\n\\nDavid: And then in the year 2000, they just totally blow the doors off. A hundred twenty-eight percent gross returns, net returns after fees of 98.5%. This is bananas.\\n\\nBen: They grow the fund from $1.9 billion to $3.8 billion of assets under management. Again, purely by investing gains, not by getting any new investors the year the tech bubble burst.\\n\\nDavid: While the whole rest of the market is down big time, Medallion is up 128% gross on the year. This becomes a theme. High volatility is when Medallion really shines.\\n\\nBen: And here you go, uncorrelated. They have their final stamp of approval right here of not only are we a money printing machine, we are a money printing machine in all environments regardless of the state of the broad market.\\n\\nDavid, as you said, volatility actually makes their algorithms work even better, because what are they doing? They’re looking for scenarios where the market’s going to act erratically, and they can take advantage of people making decisions that they shouldn’t. Anytime any investors are under pressure, there’s a little bit of edge that’s going to accrue to a Medallion that’s saying, oh, okay, you’re fear-selling right now. Well, I can determine if you should be fear-selling or not. If I determine that you shouldn’t be dumping that asset, I’m buying it from you.\\n\\nDavid: There’s a really fun story around this that really illustrates Jim’s genius in managing the firm and the people, and how this year was when they really figured this out. The first couple of days of the tech bubble bursting, Medallion actually takes a bunch of large losses.\\n\\nPart of it might be that the model wasn’t tuned right yet because nobody at RenTech had seen this type of behavior in the market before. Part of it might also be, too, that it didn’t perform well for those couple of days. It’s a really stressful time for everybody.\\n\\nEverybody’s in Jim’s office. Jim’s smoking his cigarettes, it’s a cloud of smoke, they’re debating what to do, and Jim makes the call to take some risk off. He’s worried about blowing up. We’re not very far removed at this point from long-term capital management. The model may be saying we should stay long here, but let’s not blow up the firm.\\n\\nAfter this goes down, Peter Brown comes to Jim and offers to resign given the losses that they incurred over these couple of days. Jim says, what are you talking about? Of course you shouldn’t resign. You are way more valuable to the firm now that you’ve lived through this, and you now know not to 100% trust the model in all situations.\\n\\nBen: It’s fascinating. It’s such a good insight. That illustrates Jim as a leader right there.\\n\\nDavid: It totally does. There’s a parallel story when Jim ultimately does retire in 2009, and Peter and Bob take over as co-CEOs, where a year or so before the “quant quake” had happened, where similar to the tech bubble bursting, there was, all of a sudden, very large drawdowns among all quantitative firms in the market and RenTech gets hit.\\n\\nDuring that period, Peter argued very strenuously that we should trust the model, stay risk on, this is going to be an incredibly profitable time for us. Jim pumped the brakes and stepped in, intervened, and took risk off. Peter goes to Jim, again around the CEO transition and says, Hey Jim, aren’t you worried that with me running the place now, I’m going to be too aggressive and blow it up one of these days? Jim says, no, I’m not worried at all. I know you were only so aggressive in that moment because I was there pushing back on you. And when you’re in the seat, you’re going to be less aggressive. He’s just such a master at insight into human behavior.\\n\\nBen: It is so true, though. I even find this about myself, that I will naturally take the position of the foil to the person across from me. So if somebody’s being pushy in some way, I’ll find myself taking a position where if I pause and reflect, I’m like, I don’t think I expected to take this position coming into this conversation. But you know you naturally want to play the other side to balance out the person sitting across from you.\\n\\nDavid: Back to the year 2000 in this incredible performance. Ben, to what you were saying earlier about uncorrelated returns, not only did they shoot the lights out that year, they’re doing it when the market is down.\\n\\nWe got to introduce this concept of a Sharpe ratio now, which for all of you listeners that are in the finance world, you’ll know this, but for everybody else this is a really important concept.\\n\\nBen: I think people grasp it intuitively. We’ve mentioned this concept a couple of times this episode where, okay, great, it’s amazing to have a fund that 25X’s, or a year where you have a 100% investment return, or I bought Bitcoin yesterday and it doubled overnight.\\n\\nDoes that make you one of the best investors in the world? We all intuitively know, no it doesn’t, because maybe that was a fluke, maybe you’re taking on an extreme amount of risk, and then the question is always adjusting for the risk that you’re taking. Can you produce a superior return taking the risk into that account?\\n\\nYou basically can provide value to investors as a fund manager in two ways. You can outperform the market, or you can be entirely uncorrelated with the market and get market returns. Or what you can do, as RenTech is, both. You can be uncorrelated and massively outperform, which is effectively the holy grail of money management.\\n\\nDavid: The Sharpe ratio is a measurement combining these two concepts.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. It’s named after the economist William F. Sharpe. It was pioneered in 1966. It is effectively the measure of a fund’s performance relative to the risk-free rate. If you performed at 15% that year and the risk-free rate was 3%, then you know your numerator is going to be 12%.\\n\\nIt is compared against the volatility (or the standard deviation is technically what it is), but effectively, how volatile have you been the last X years? Typically, it’s looked at as a 3-year Sharpe or a 5-year Sharpe or a 10-year Sharpe. The Sharpe ratio represents the additional amount of return that an investor receives per unit of an increase in risk.\\n\\nDavid, you’re starting to throw out numbers. Low Sharpe ratios are bad. Negative Sharpe ratios are worse because that means you’re underperforming the risk-free rate. High Sharpe ratios are good because it means that you’re producing lots of returns, and your variance or your standard deviation or your risk is low.\\n\\nSo in 1990 they had a Sharpe of 2.0, which was twice that of the S&P 500 benchmark. Awesome. 1995 to 2000, Sharpe ratio of 2.5 really starting to hum. Pretty unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: Good. Where do I sign up to invest?\\n\\nBen: At some point they added foreign markets and achieved a Sharpe ratio of 6.3, which is double the best quant firms. This is a firm that has almost no chance of losing money, at least historically, and massively outperforms the market on an uncorrelated basis.\\n\\nDavid: I believe if I have my research right, in 2004, they actually achieved a Sharpe ratio of 7.5.\\n\\nBen: Astonishing.\\n\\nDavid: Again, back to our sports analogy here, these aren’t hall of fame numbers. These make Tom Brady look like a third stringer.\\n\\nBen: Exactly.\\n\\nDavid: On the back of 2000 and this rise, the next year in 2001, they raise the carried interest on the fund to 36% up from either 20% or 25% whatever it was before. Now remember, they’ve already closed the fund to new investors. There are still outside investors in the fund, but no new investors are coming in.\\n\\nThen the next year in 2002, they raised the carry to 44%. Great work if you can get it, but for context, the Sequoia and the Benchmarks out there, they have obscene carry of 30%, 44% is unprecedented.\\n\\nBen: There are two interesting ways to look at this. One, they’re just trying to jack it up so high that they just purge their existing investors out where they’re saying, we’re not going to kick anyone out yet, but we’ve been closed to new business for a long time now. You should see yourself out at some point.\\n\\nThe other way to look at this, which I think is probably the right way to look at it, is investors are arbitragers. They see a mispricing, they come into the market, they fix that mispricing. Anytime that there’s an opportunity to bring the way that a currency is trading on two different exchanges closer together, investors are serving their purpose of coming in, arbitraging that difference, taking a little bit of profit as a thank you, and then fixing the market to make the market a true weighing machine. Not a voting machine, but making it so that all prices reflect the value of what something is actually worth.\\n\\nIn some ways, that’s what Renaissance is doing here to themselves or to their investors. They’re coming in and saying, look, this is obscene. We so clearly outperform the market, you’re still going to take this deal even if we take more of this because there’s just a mispricing here. This product should not be priced at 20%–25% carry. This product should be priced at a much higher carried interest, and you’re still going to love it.\\n\\nDavid: You should pay 20% carry for a firm that delivers you 15% annual returns. We’re delivering you 50% annual returns.\\n\\nBen: Totally. I have to imagine it didn’t go over well with the existing investors, but they just have so much leverage that what’s going to happen?\\n\\nDavid: Once again, I’m sorry audience. I have to say hold on one more minute for another perspective that I have to offer on the carry element. I want to finish the story first. 2001, they raised the carry to 36%, 2002, they raise it to 44%, and then in 2003 they actually say, hey, we can’t incentivize you out of the fund outside investors. We are going to kick you out. Starting in 2003, everybody who’s an outside investor, who’s not part of the RenTech, family—current employee or alumni of the firm—gets kicked out\\n\\nBen: And not all alumni get to stay. There are select alumni that get grandfathered in.\\n\\nDavid: Now why did we do this? I’m going to talk about one reason in a minute. One reason is super obvious. The Medallion fund is now at $5 billion in assets under management that they’re trading. Even in the equities market, they are now hitting up against slippage. If they want to maintain this crazy, crazy performance, they just can’t get that much bigger.\\n\\nBen: This is the problem that Warren Buffett talks about all the time, and why he has to basically just increase his position in Apple rather than going and buying the next great family-owned business. The things that move the needle for them are so big, that that’s really all they can do. And when you are big, you’re going to move any market that you enter into. The strategy that RenTech is employing right now, they’re just deeming doesn’t work at north of $5 billion.\\n\\nDavid: In 2003, they start kicking all the outside investors out of Medallion. But clearly there are still lots of institutional demand to invest with Renaissance. What do they do?\\n\\nBen: Time to start another fund. They start the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund. There are a couple of things to add a little bit of context to really why they decide to do this.\\n\\nThe first one is sometimes there are just more profitable strategies than they had the capital to take advantage of in Medallion, but they weren’t sure it would be on a durable basis. If they were sure that they could manage $10, $15, $20, $25 billion in Medallion all the time, then they would grow to that. But just sometimes there are these strategies that appear, oh, we don’t want to commit to a much higher fund size and then not always have those strategies available.\\n\\nThe other thing is that a lot of the times, those strategies aren’t really what Medallion is set up to do. They require longer hold times. There’s a little bit of downside to that because these new strategies, the predictive abilities are less because they have to predict further into the future to understand what the exit prices will be on these longer term holds. But they still figure, hey, even though it’s not quite our bread and butter with the short-term stuff, we should be able to make some money doing it.\\n\\nDavid: There’s a fun story around this that Peter Brown tells. Jim came into his office one day and said, Peter, I got a thought exercise for you. If you married a Rockefeller, would you advise the family that they should invest a large portion of their wealth in the S&P 500? Peter says, no, of course not. That’s not a great risk adjusted return.\\n\\nBen: And these guys are very used to Sharpe ratios that are far better than the S&P.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Jim says, yes, exactly. Now get to work on designing the product that they should invest in.\\n\\nBen: That’s basically what they come up with. Can we create something that’s like an S&P 500 with a higher Sharpe ratio? Can we beat the market by a few percentage points, or frankly even match the market each year with lower volatility than if they were buying an index fund?\\n\\nYou can see who this would be very attractive to—pensions, large institutions, firms that want to compound at market or slightly above market rate, but don’t want to risk these massive drawdowns or frankly just big volatility in general should they need to pull the capital earlier. The nice thing about being invested in a hedge fund versus a venture fund is you can do redemptions.\\n\\nIf you look at the 13Fs, the SEC documents that the Renaissance institutional equities fund files over time, it changes every quarter because there are new people putting money in, there are people doing redemption. It’s a pretty good product, or at least the theory behind it is a pretty good product of a lower risk similar return thing to the S&P 500.\\n\\nDavid: And the marketing is built in. It’s not like there’s any lack of demand of outside capital that wants to invest with RenTech.\\n\\nBen: It’s really funny. There are always stories about how the marketing documents literally say this is not the Medallion fund. We don’t promise returns like the Medallion fund. In fact, we’re not charging for it like the Medallion fund.\\n\\nDavid, you said that the fees and carry on Medallion went up to what, 5% and 44%? Well on the institutional fund, the fees are 1% and 10%. You’re only taking 1% annual fee and 10% of the performance.\\n\\nDavid: Clearly, this is a very different product.\\n\\nBen: But people did not perceive that. People were very excited. It’s a Renaissance product, it’s the same analysts, they’re using all their fancy computers. I’m sure we’re going to get this crazy out performance. And at the end of the day, it is an extremely different vehicle.\\n\\nDavid: That has not performed anywhere near how Medallion has performed.\\n\\nBen: Correct. Has it served its purpose? Yeah. But is it Medallion? No. It’s not special in the way that Medallion is special.\\n\\nA couple of other funny things on the institutional fund. I spent a bunch of time scrolling through 13Fs over the last decade from the Medallion filings. They’re all from (I think) two institutional funds.\\n\\nDavid: There’s institutional equities and diversified alpha.\\n\\nBen: The funniest thing is they file these 13Fs. David and I are very used to looking at the 13Fs of friends of the show who run hedge funds, who we’ve had on as guests, or perhaps really just any investor where you want to see what are they buying and selling this quarter, and usually you see 15, 25, maybe 50 different names on there.\\n\\nThe 13Fs for Renaissance has 4300 stocks in these tiny little chunks. There’s a little bit of persistence, quarter-to-quarter. For example, weirdly Novo Nordisk has been one of their biggest holdings. Biggest, I say at 1%–2%. That’s their biggest position for several quarters in a row.\\n\\nDavid: Hey, they’ve been listening to Acquired.\\n\\nBen: That’s right.\\n\\nDavid: That’s one of the signals in the model.\\n\\nBen: You get the sense from looking at these filings that these things were flying all over the place, and this was just the moment in time where they decided to take a snapshot and put it on a piece of paper. Even though this is the end of quarter filing of what their ownership was, if you had taken it a day or a week earlier, it could look completely different.\\n\\nDavid: The way that some folks we talked to described the difference between the institutional funds and Medallion to us is that Medallion’s average hold time for their trades and positions is (call it) a day, maybe a day-and-a-half. Whereas the average hold time for the institutional funds positions is a couple of months.\\n\\nAcross 4300 stocks in the portfolio, there’s a lot of trading activity that happens on any given day, but it’s a lot slower in any given name than Medallion would be, which makes sense. Again, it gets back to this slippage concept. If you have a bigger fund and you’re investing larger amounts, which the institutional funds are, you can’t be trading as frequently or all of your gains are going to slip away.\\n\\nBen: And frankly, it just looks a lot like the S&P 500. When you look at as of November 2023, so 11 of the 12 months of the year had happened, they were up 8.6%. That sounds like an index type return. You look at the first 4 months of 2020, right after the crazy dip from the pandemic, they were down 10.4%. Less than the broader market, but they still were a mirror of the broader market.\\n\\nI think the RIEF, their institutional fund, yes it works as expected. No, it’s not Medallion. If it were standing on its own, there’s zero chance that we would be covering the organization behind it on Acquired.\\n\\nDavid: Zero percent chance. Speaking of the fund—that is the reason why we are covering this company on this show—we set up during the tech bubble crash, the volatility is when Medallion really shines. Well, there are no more volatile periods than 2007 and 2008. 2007 Medallion does 136% gross. 2008 Medallion does 152% gross. Get out of here. This is 2008 while the rest of the financial world is melting down.\\n\\nBen: This really does illustrate where do they make their money from? Who is on the other side of these trades? It’s people acting emotionally. They have effectively these really robust models that are highly unemotional, that are making these super intricate multi security bets. They’re putting on exactly the right set of trades to achieve the risk and exposure that the system wants them to have.\\n\\nWho is on the other side of those trades? It’s panic sellers, it’s dentists, it’s hedge funds who don’t trust their computer systems and are like, ah, crap, we got to just take risk off even though it’s a negative expected value move for us. They’re basically trading against human nature.\\n\\nImportantly, in this business versus every other business that we cover here on Acquired or most other businesses, this is truly zero sum. It’s not like they’re here in an industry that’s a growth industry and lots of competitors can take different approaches, but the whole pie is growing so much that I don’t care if no, you’re fighting over a fixed pie here. I’m trading against someone else. I win. They lose.\\n\\nDavid: There’s one slight nuance to that, but I don’t know how much it holds water. The apologist nuance would be, well, Warren Buffett could be on the other side of the trade, and Medallion could make money on that trade with Warren over its time horizon of a day-and-a-half. Warren could make money over his time horizon of 50 years.\\n\\nBen: Super fair.\\n\\nDavid: I think the argument against that, though, is that Medallions sold after a day-and-a-half to somebody else who bought at that lower price. Somewhere along the chain, that loss is getting offloaded to somebody. The direct counterparty of Medallion and the quant industry writ large might not take the loss, but somebody is going to take the loss along the way. It is, as you say, a zero sum game.\\n\\nBen: But I think the important thing is can you and your adversary both benefit, and I think in this case, you and your counterparty, the person you’re trading against, yes. You have two different objective outcomes. Can I get a penny over on Warren Buffet by managing to take him on this one trade? Sure. But his strategy is such that that is irrelevant.\\n\\nDavid: After the historic performance, during the financial crisis (as I alluded to earlier), Jim retires at the end of 2009, and Peter and Bob become co-CEOs, co-heads of the firm in 2010. They take the portfolio size up to $10 billion when they take over. It had been at $5 billion for the last few years of Jim’s tenure. They take it up to $10 billion, and really with no impact, which I assume means that RenTech was getting better and the models were getting better, because Otherwise they would’ve gone to $10 billion before.\\n\\nBen: They gained confidence that they had enough profitable trades they could make, that they could raise the capacity without dampening returns. And perhaps they could have done it earlier and they just didn’t have the confidence that it would work at larger size, but I bet they’re very good at knowing how large can our strategy work up to before it starts having diminishing returns.\\n\\nDavid: Importantly, during periods of peak volatility, say 2020, Medallion continues to shoot the lights out. From at least the data that we were able to find on Medallion’s performance over the past few years, 2020, they were up 149% gross and 76% net. The magic is still there.\\n\\nOne way to look at it, which may not be the be-all-and-end-all, but I think is a good way to compare Jim’s era at Medallion versus Peter and Bob’s era. During Jim’s tenure, Medallion’s total aggregate IRR from 1988 when the fund was formed to 2009 when he retired, was 63.5% gross annual returns and 40.1% net annual returns, which of course did include many periods of lower carry, 20% versus the 44%.\\n\\nDuring the post-Jim era, the Peter and Bob era from 2010 to 2022 was when we were able to get the latest data, IRRs are 77.3% gross and 40.3% net. Better on both fronts, even with much higher average fees. yeah, I think Medallion is doing fine.\\n\\nBen: It’s amazing. And we weren’t able to tell. There are some sources that report that they’ve grown from $10 billion in the last few years to being comfortable at a $15 billion fund size. If so, that just means that they continue to find more profitable strategies within Medallion to keep those same unbelievable returns at larger sizes.\\n\\nDavid: At the end of the day, this is all just insane. As far as we can tell—Ben, you alluded to this a bit at the beginning of the episode—and as far as anybody else can tell, Medallion has by far the best investing track record of any single investment vehicle in history.\\n\\nBen: So give me those net numbers.\\n\\nDavid: During the entire lifetime so far of Medallion from 1988 to 2022—that’s 34 years—the total net annual return number is 40%. Four-zero over 34 years after fees. It’s 68% before fees, which equates to total lifetime carry dollars for the whole firm of $60 billion just in carry by our calculations.\\n\\nBen: Astonishing.\\n\\nDavid: That is a lot of money.\\n\\nBen: Also, David Rosenthal, good spreadsheet work on this. You have not done a spreadsheet for an episode in a while, so I admire your work on this one.\\n\\nDavid: I still know how to use Excel. Barely. It’s going to be a dying art now with Copilot and GPTs.\\n\\nBen: That’s right. Okay, so $60 billion in total carry.\\n\\nDavid: $60 billion in total carry is a lot of money. Speaking of a lot of money, we do need to mention before we finish the story here, that RenTech money has bought a lot of influence in society.\\n\\nBob Mercer—that name may have sounded familiar to many of you along the way—was the primary funder of Breitbart and Cambridge Analytica, and one of the major financial backers of both the 2016 Trump campaign and the Brexit campaign in Great Britain.\\n\\nNow, lest you think that RenTech dollars are solely being funneled into one side of the political spectrum, Jim Simons is a major democratic donor, as are many other folks at RenTech.\\n\\nBen: Henry Laufer and other folks are also huge donors, approximately to the same tune as what Bob Mercer is on the right.\\n\\nDavid: Tens of millions of dollars, many tens of millions of dollars on all sides, and through many campaign cycles here from RenTech employees and alumni, This did become a flashpoint for the firm in the wake of the 2016 election. Mercer obviously became a controversial figure, both externally and internally within the firm.\\n\\nBen: Especially once people realized he was the through line through Breitbart, Cambridge Analytica, the Trump election, and Brexit.\\n\\nDavid: Ultimately, Jim asked Bob to step down as co-CEO in 2017, which he did, but he did remain a scientist at the firm and a contributor to the models, even though he wasn’t leading the organization with Peter from a leadership standpoint any longer.\\n\\nBen: Ultimately, the thing that surprised me the most is how these people all still work together, despite having about the most opposite political beliefs you could possibly have.\\n\\nDavid: Understatement of the century.\\n\\nBen: And all being extremely influential and active in those political systems. Yes, Bob Mercer is no longer the co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies. He still works there. He’s still associated. They all still speak highly of each other. It’s unexpected.\\n\\nDavid: I think unexpected is the best way to put it.\\n\\nBen: Like everything with Renaissance, it works a little bit different than the rest of the world.\\n\\nDavid: Speaking of, let’s transition to analysis. I have a fun little monologue I want to go on, if you will. Bear with me, Ben. I think this qualifies as the RenTech playbook, but I really think of it as the RenTech tapestry.\\n\\nI was inspired by Costco here because we were talking to folks in the research, and everybody said RenTech just has these puzzle pieces that fit together. On the surface. RenTech does the same things that Citadel, D. E. Shaw, Two Sigma, Jane Street, others, et cetera do. They hire the smartest people in the world, they give them the best data and infrastructure in the world to work on, and they say, go to town and make profitable trades.\\n\\nThose are very expensive commodities, those two things, the smartest people in the world and the best data and infrastructure, but they are commodities. Citadel can say the exact same things, just the same as Walmart and Amazon can say, we too have large scale supplier relationships that we leverage to provide low prices to customers just like Costco.\\n\\nBut it’s underneath that where I think the magic lies. There are three very interrelated things that make RenTech unique. Number one, they get the smartest people in the world to collaborate and not compete. Pretty much every other financial firm out there, employees and teams within the firm quasi compete with one another.\\n\\nBen: Typically in a friendly way, but yeah.\\n\\nDavid: Let’s take in a venture firm, you’ve got your lead partner on a deal, or a deal team. They’re working that deal. Maybe some of the other partners help a little bit, but mostly they’re off prosecuting their own deals. I think that’s the most collegial way that this happens in finance. Then you’ve got multi-strategy hedge funds out there where literally firms are being pitted against one another to be weighted in the ultimate trading model for the firm.\\n\\nAt RenTech, though, because of the one model architecture, everyone works together on the same investment strategy and the same investment infrastructure. That means everyone sees everybody else’s work. Everybody who works at RenTech on the research team, on the infrastructure team, have access to the whole model. That’s not true anywhere else.\\n\\nBen: That’s a good point. The whole code base is completely visible.\\n\\nDavid: And that also means because it’s just one model, just one strategy, when somebody else improves that model’s performance, that directly impacts you as much as it impacts them. This is really different from any other hedge fund out there.\\n\\nBen: Why is that different than if I roll some of my compensation into a multi-strategy hedge fund that I work at? Don’t I love other teams creating high performance also?\\n\\nDavid: Sure, but you don’t love it as much as your team because either compensation or career-wise, you are much more dependent on your performance than you are other people’s performance.\\n\\nBen: Oh yes. This is a big thing. You intend to have a job after that job at most places most of the time, so you care about credit, and you care about smashing the pinata and then going elsewhere, or building reputation and then going elsewhere. Most of the people at RenTech are not going to have another job.\\n\\nDavid: What did you find on LinkedIn, at least the median tenure of employees is like 16 years?\\n\\nBen: Yeah. I just got LinkedIn Premium and you can see median tenure. It’s crazy. There are only 300–400 employees at Renaissance, and the median tenure, at least as reported by LinkedIn, is 14 years.\\n\\nDavid: This brings me to point number two, which you said, this is an absurdly small team. There are less than 400 employees that work at RenTech, only half of which work in research and engineering, and the other half are either back office or institutional sales for the open funds. Let’s call it 150–200 people max who are hands-on the wheel here for Medallion.\\n\\nEvery other peer firm of RenTech, Citadel, D. E. Shaw, Two Sigma, et cetera, all of them—you lump Jane Street, jump the high frequency guys in here—minimum 2000–5000 people work at those places.\\n\\nBen: Wow. I didn’t realize it was that big.\\n\\nDavid: It is an order of magnitude more people who are working at the other firms versus who are working at RenTech.\\n\\nBen: Unless you think that it’s a capital-based thing, no. The institutional funds have gotten big. They peaked at over $100 billion, but they’re currently between $60 and $70 billion that they manage on top of the $10 or $15 billion that’s in the Medallion fund.\\n\\nDavid: AUM is the same as these big funds. This has all sorts of benefits. Number one, there’s the Hermès Atelier workshop benefit. Everyone knows each other by name. You know your colleagues’ kids, you know your colleagues’ families.\\n\\nBen: They put right on their website. There are 90 PhDs in mathematics, physics, computer science, and related fields. The about page has these 10 random bullet points and that’s one of them.\\n\\nDavid: Then there’s the related aspect to all this. The firm is in the middle of nowhere on Long Island. You actually know your colleagues, families, and kids because you’re not going out and getting drinks with someone from Two Sigma in New York City. You’re not comparing notes or measuring parts of your anatomy with someone else. You’re hanging out at the swimming pool.\\n\\nBen: Totally. Since Renaissance doesn’t recruit from finance jobs, it’s unlikely that you know someone else in finance. You came out of a science-related field. You now work in East Setauket, Long Island, which has 10,000 people or something or less that live there. You’re in this little town, you’re not actually going into the city that often, and if you are, it’s (again) not to grab drinks with other finance people. Even if you didn’t have a many-page non-compete and a lifetime NDA, you’re very unlikely to be in the social circles.\\n\\nDavid: You’re Just not getting exposed.\\n\\nBen: Exactly.\\n\\nDavid: And RenTech’s hiring established scientists and PhDs. They’re not hiring kids out of undergrad like Jane Street or Bridgewater is. My sense is that the place is like a college campus without any students.\\n\\nBen: Have you seen the pictures online?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah.\\n\\nBen: If you look up Renaissance Technologies at Google and you go and look at the photos on campus, it’s little courtyard, winding walking path, and woods all around it, tennis courts.\\n\\nDavid: Then there’s the last piece of the small team element, which is just the magnitude of the financial impact, which I don’t think is true. But let’s say that there were another quant fund that made the same number of dollars of performance returns that RenTech does. At RenTech you’re splitting that a couple of hundred ways. At Citadel you’re splitting that 5000 ways. It just doesn’t make sense to go anywhere else.\\n\\nBen: We were chatting with someone to prep for this episode, and they told us you can’t ever compete with them, but they’ll pay you enough that you won’t want to.\\n\\nDavid: This brings me to what I’ve been teasing that I’m super excited about. I think the third puzzle piece of what makes RenTech so unique and defensible is Medallion’s structure itself, that it is an LP-GP fund with 5% management fee and 44% carry.\\n\\nBen: It’s not like a prop shop or proprietary just one pot of money. It’s literally a GP-LP, even though the GPs and the LPs are the same people.\\n\\nDavid: Here’s my thinking on this. Now, I don’t know how it is actually structured, but there was something about this whole crazy 44% carry that just wasn’t sitting with me right throughout the research, because I kept asking myself why.\\n\\nBen: They’ve already kicked out most of the LPs, if not all, so why are they raising the carry?\\n\\nDavid: It’s all themselves, it’s all insiders. Why do they charge themselves 44% carry and 5% management fees? I think Jim talks about this that, oh, I pay the fees just like everybody else.\\n\\nBen: It’s always a funny argument. Who are you paying the fees to?\\n\\nDavid: What is happening here? Okay, here’s my hypothesis. This is not about having crazy performance fees. This is not about having the highest carry in the industry. This is a value transfer mechanism within the firm, from the tenure base to the current people who are working on Medallion in any given year.\\n\\nHere’s how I think it works. When people come into RenTech, they obviously have way less wealth than the people who’ve been there for a long time, both from the direct returns that you’re getting every year from working there and just your investment percentage of the Medallion fund, which by the way, I think they took, it was either the state of New York or the federal government to court to be able to have the 401(k) plan at RenTech be the Medallion fund.\\n\\nBen: No way.\\n\\nDavid: If you work there, your 401(k) is the Medallion fund.\\n\\nBen: That’s crazy. It really doesn’t take more than a few years before you’re set for life.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Depending on your definition of set for life, I think it happens very, very quickly. Given that, though, how do you avoid the incentive for a group of talented younger folks to split off and go start their own Medallion fund?\\n\\nBen: Especially when they all have access to the whole code base. The whole thing is meant to function like a university math department, where everyone’s constantly knowledge-sharing because we’re going to create better peer-reviewed research when we all share all the knowledge all the time. You would think that’s a super risky thing to give everyone all the keys.\\n\\nDavid: I think it’s the 44% carry structure that does it. Basically what you’re saying is every year 5% management fee, so 5% off the top and then 44% of performance.\\n\\nLet’s say Medallion is on the order of (call it) doubling every year. Let’s round that up and just add them and say 49% of the economic returns in any given year go to the current team, and 51% of the economic returns go to the tenure base.\\n\\nWhat is the equivalent here? I think it’s like academic tenure kind of thing. The longer tenure you are at the firm, the more your balance shifts to the LP side of things. The younger you are at the firm, the more your balance is on the GP side of things. But at the end of the day, it’s 51-49.\\n\\nThere’s this very natural value transfer mechanism to keep the people that are working in any given year super incentivized. As you stay there longer, you are paying your younger colleagues to work for you.\\n\\nBen: It’s funny, I think it’s a good insight that it’s structured like a university department tenure.\\n\\nDavid: Well, I just kept asking myself, why? Why? Why do they have this if there are no outside LPs? And this was the best thing I could come up with. I actually think it’s genius.\\n\\nBen: It’s more elegant than it’s all one person’s money and they’re deciding to bonus out the current team every year and just give them enough money to make sure you retain them.\\n\\nDavid: Which is how I think most prop shops work. Like Jane Street is mostly a prop shop. I think it is mostly the principal’s money, but that’s a static situation. It’s not like if that were true then Jim would just own this thing forever. I don’t think that’s true here at RenTech.\\n\\nBen: Essentially David, the real magic is they’ve got one fund, it’s evergreen, and when you start at the firm, you’re only getting paid the carry amount, but over time you become a meaningful investor in the firm and you shift to that 51%. You’re the LP, and then over time you eventually graduate out entirely and you’re only an LP.\\n\\nYou’re right, it’s a value transfer mechanism from the old guard to the new guard in a way that is clear, well understood, probably tax-advantaged, versus just doing, I’m the owner and I’m giving everyone arbitrary bonuses.\\n\\nDavid: And at the end of the day, I think these three pieces to me are the core of this tapestry of RenTech. One model that everybody collaborates on together. A super small team where we all know each other, and the financial impact that any of us make to that one model is great to all of us.\\n\\nThree, this LP-GP model with very high carry performance fees, that creates the right set of incentives both for new talent on the way in and old talent on the way out.\\n\\nBen: I think that’s right. There are a few other parts of the story that we skipped along the way because there was no real good place to put them in. But these are objectively fascinating historical events that are totally worth knowing about.\\n\\nThe first one is called basket options. The year is 2002. RenTech has 13 years of knowing that they basically have a machine that prints money. What should you do when you have a machine that prints money? Leverage.\\n\\nNow, there are all sorts of restrictions around firms like this and how much leverage they can take on. You can’t just go and say, I’m going to borrow $100 for every dollar of equity capital that I have in here. You need to get clever to borrow a whole bunch of money from banks or from any lender to basically juicier returns if again, you have a money printing machine that’s reliable. Most people don’t. Most people probably shouldn’t take leverage because they’re just as likely to blow the whole thing up as they are to be successful. So basket options.\\n\\nI am going to read directly from the man who solved the market because Greg Zuckerman just put it perfectly. “Basket options are financial instruments whose values are pegged to their performance of a specific basket of stocks. While most options are based on an individual stock or a financial instrument, basket options are linked to a group of shares. If these underlying stocks rise, the value of the option goes up.\\n\\nIt’s like owning the shares without actually doing so. Indeed, the banks who of course loaned the money, who put the money in the basket option were legal owners of the shares in the basket. But for all intents and purposes, they were Medallion’s property.”\\n\\nThis is very clever Medallion saying, well, the way we’re going to lever up is there’s a basket. We have an option to purchase that basket. Most of the capital in that basket is actually the bank’s capital, but the bank has hired us to trade the options in the basket. Then after a year when long-term capital gains tax kicks in, we have the option to buy that basket.\\n\\nAnyway, all day Medallion’s computers send automated instructions to the banks. Sometimes in the order of a minute or even a second. The options gave Medallion the ability to borrow significantly more than it otherwise would be allowed to.\\n\\nCompetitors generally had about $7 of financial instruments for every dollar of cash. By contrast, Medallion’s option strategy allowed it to have $12.50 worth of financial instruments for every dollar of cash, making it easier to trounce rivals, assuming they could keep finding profitable trades. When Medallion finds an especially juicy opportunity, it could boost leverage holding close to $20 of asset for every dollar of cash. In 2002, Medallion managed over $5 billion, but it controlled over $60 billion of investment positions.\\n\\nDavid, this exposes something we haven’t shared yet on the episode, which is it’s not just that they could find $5 billion worth of profitable trades. It’s that they wanted to lever the crap out of $5 billion and find $60 billion of profitable trades to make. Basket options gave them a legal way to have an incredible amount of leverage in a way that they felt safe about.\\n\\nDavid: The unlevered returns, if you were running this strategy would be much lower.\\n\\nBen: A big piece of this playbook that we didn’t talk about is leverage, but every quant fund does leverage. Renaissance was just more clever than everyone else.\\n\\nDavid: It’s an important point, though. Nine out of every ten companies that we cover on Acquired leverage is zero part of the story. For us, coming from the world we come from in tech and venture capital, leverage is a dirty word, like I’m scared of it.\\n\\nBen: You could imagine, let’s say it wasn’t they were right 50.25% of the time, but they were right 50.0001% of the time. They would need to do a ton of trades in order to generate enough profits. That’s why you need $60 billion of cash to actually execute the strategy to produce the returns that they were looking for on $5 billion of equity.\\n\\nAnyway, there’s a second chapter to this. It’s all well and good that this is how they get a bunch of leverage. That’s one piece of it. The other piece is they thought this was a remarkably tax-efficient vehicle. The way that they were filing their taxes said, oh sure there’s stuff in that basket, but the thing that we actually own is an option to buy that basket or sell that basket. We only exercise that once every 13 months or so.\\n\\nI don’t know the exact number, but something like that over a year. Therefore, we’re buying something, we’re holding it for a year, we’re selling it. Oh, of course there are millions and millions of trades going on inside the basket, but we don’t own that basket. The banks do. We’re just advising them. You can see the logic here.\\n\\nOver time, eventually in 2021, the IRS said, no. You made all those trades. That was not a completely separate entity. You guys owed $6.8 billion in taxes that you didn’t pay. You’re going to need to pay that with interest, with penalties, and by the way, Jim Simons, we’re going to want you and the other few partners to really bear the load of that. And they did. For Simons alone, he paid $670 million to the IRS in back taxes for this basket option strategy that turned out not to be a long-term capital gain.\\n\\nAll right. Numbers on the business today and then we will dive into power and playbook. Today, we’ve talked about Medallion, $10 or $15 billion depending on who you ask. Historically it was more like $5 or $10 billion. The institutional fund is about $60 to $70 billion, and at one point was $100 billion. The total carry generated, David, you said is $60 billion.\\n\\nForbes estimates that Jim Simons alone is worth about $30 billion today, which pencils with a bunch of other stats over the years that he owned about half of Renaissance. The returns, obviously the Medallion fund generated approximately 66% annualized from 1988 to 2020. After those fees, was about 39%. Wild.\\n\\nAn interesting thing to understand, I ran a hypothetical scenario, of how much money do you think Renaissance the business makes a year in revenue. The institutional fund, let’s call it 10% on $60 billion of assets. That’s $600 million from fees and $600 million from performance, so $1.2 billion a year in revenue to the firm from the institutional side of the business.\\n\\nI always ask myself the question, does that actually matter? They did all this work to stand up the institutional side. Who cares? Well, let’s say Medallion does their average 66% gross on $15 billion. That is $750 million in fees and $4.3 billion on performance. So a total of $5 billion from Medallion and $1.2 billion from the institutional side of the business.\\n\\nNow of course the employees are the investors in Medallion, so you could just argue it’s actually silly to cut them up, but I don’t know. It’s a $7, $8, $9 billion revenue business.\\n\\nDavid: That’s not including the LP return on Medallion.\\n\\nBen: A hundred percent. It’s not.\\n\\nDavid: Which again, as we spent a long time talking about, it’s all the same thing.\\n\\nBen: But it’s interesting just to compare it against other companies to have this in the back of your head. This is a $7–$8 billion a year revenue business.\\n\\nDavid: Now, I think there are a lot of expenses on the infrastructure side.\\n\\nBen: Totally. That was another thing I wanted to talk about. The fact that they do, let’s say Medallion alone, have $750 million in fees. I don’t think they come close to $750 million a year in expenses, but they are running, who knows what infrastructure, some kind of super computing cluster. What does it cost to run one Amazon data center? It’s (I think) much smaller scale?\\n\\nDavid: I don’t know. You’re talking about a lot of data here.\\n\\nBen: It says right on their website they have 50,000 computer cores with 150 gigabits per second of global connectivity, and a research database that grows by more than 40 terabytes a day. That’s a lot of data.\\n\\nDavid: Is that $750 million a year? I don’t know, but it’s not zero.\\n\\nBen: I don’t think so. They’re certainly not losing money on the fees, but there are actual hard costs to this business.\\n\\nDavid: I wonder, too, if the fee element of Medallion basically pays the base salaries for the current team.\\n\\nBen: That feels like it’s right. If you’re someone who has done a data center build out before or has any way to back into what the costs of Medallion’s operating expenses are on the compute, data, and network side, we would love to hear from you, hello@acquired.fm. Okay, power.\\n\\nDavid: Power. This is a fun one.\\n\\nBen: Listeners who are new to the show, this is Hamilton Helmer’s framework from the book Seven Powers. What is it that enables a business to achieve persistent differential returns to be more profitable than their closest competitor on a sustainable basis? The seven are counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs, network economies, process power, branding, and cornered resource.\\n\\nDavid, my question to you to open this section is specifically about RenTech’s lifelong non-competes. That feels like a big reason that they maintain their competitive advantage. I’m curious if you agree with that, what would you put that under?\\n\\nDavid: I think it’s lifelong NDAs and non-competes as long as the state of New York legally allows for, but that it’s not lifetime. I’ve heard various figures, six years, five years, something like that. At the end of the day, non-competes are more like what is one side willing to go to court over? But the reality is people don’t leave. People don’t leave, period, and people especially don’t leave and start their own firms.\\n\\nI was thinking about this in the middle of the night, and I think there are three layers to the effective non-compete that happens with RenTech. There’s the legal layer, the base layer that you’re talking about—it’s like the agreements you sign—then there’s the economic layer of what we spent a long time talking about in tapestry of it would just be dumb to leave.\\n\\nYou’re better off staying there as part of that team with a smaller number of people than going to Sigma with a lot more people. I think that’s the next level up. And then I think the highest level is just probably the social layer. You’re there with the smartest people in the world in a collegial atmosphere where you’re all working hard on something that has direct impact on you.\\n\\nBen: It’s your community.\\n\\nDavid: It’s your community, totally. You’re not in New York City, you’re not in the Hamptons, you’re not in Silicon Valley. You are selecting into that. I think if that’s what you want, then what better place in the world.\\n\\nBen: All right, classify it. What power does that fall under?\\n\\nDavid: I think the people specifically you would put into cornered resource, but I’m not actually sure that fully captures it here. I was thinking more process power, because I think it is the combination of the people and the model and the incentive structures.\\n\\nBen: I think that’s right. I also had my biggest one being process power. You actually can develop intricate knowledge of how a system works, and then build processes around that that are hard to replicate elsewhere. I think these systems have been layered over time also, where anyone who’s come into the firm in the last five years doesn’t know how it works start to finish.\\n\\nI didn’t ask anyone to verify that, but it’s over 10 million lines of code and the level of complexity of the system of when it’s putting on trades, what trades it’s putting on, why, the speed at which they need to happen, I actually don’t think anyone holds the whole model in their head. I think there’s process power just because it’s 30+ years of complexity that’s been built up.\\n\\nDavid: I totally agree with that, particularly in the model itself. Maybe you could argue the model is a cornered resource.\\n\\nBen: I am going to argue that the data is a cornered resource. I don’t know for sure about the model. Maybe? I guess that’s the same thing as saying the knowledge of what the 10 million lines of code does, that’s the model.\\n\\nBut I actually think the fact that they have clean data and they’ve been creating systems. They have the best PhDs in the world thinking about data cleaning. That’s not a sexy job, and yet they have probably the treasure trove of historical market data in the best format that nobody else has. That’s an actual cornered resource.\\n\\nDavid: I have a couple of nuances on this. One, I think it probably is true that they have better data than any other firm thanks to Sandor Straus and the work that he started doing in the 80s before anybody else was really doing this. They have that and other firms don’t. That said, certainly all the other quant firms are throwing untold resources at all this, too.\\n\\nBen: They want to do this, and money’s not the issue.\\n\\nDavid: In chatting with a few folks about this episode, I had more than one person say to me, there are two ways that RenTech could work. One version of how it works is they discovered something 20+ years ago that is a timeless secret, and they’ve been trading on that for 20+ years.\\n\\nBen: There’s one particular relationship between types of equities that they’ve just been exploiting, and no one can figure out except them.\\n\\nDavid: And that may entirely be possible.\\n\\nBen: Isn’t that crazy?\\n\\nDavid: Right. Now, RenTech will all say that is 100% not the way that it works. It’s not that at all. If that were the way that it works, they would of course still say that because they don’t want anybody to know.\\n\\nBen: Don’t look at the relationship between soybean futures and GM. Just don’t do it.\\n\\nDavid: Let’s accept that there is a possibility that that might be true. More likely though, is that what RenTech does say is true, which is no, there is no holy grail. What we do here is we completely reinvent the whole system continuously on a two year cycle. Two years is what I heard. That the model is fully restructured every two years. It’s not like on a date every two years, it’s being restructured every day. But collectively it’s about a two-year cycle.\\n\\nBen: That would be an argument then that the people actually could—five people left—go recreate it and all they would need is the data.\\n\\nDavid: It’s also an argument that there is no actual cornered resource here in terms of either the model itself and maybe not the data either.\\n\\nBen: I bet that data is, though. Let’s say you’ve been working there for 10 years. You don’t know how the 1955 soybean futures data ended up in the database. Even if you’re used to using that data and you’re able to go recreate the model elsewhere, you don’t know how it originally found its way in.\\n\\nDavid: I think that’s fair. I think there might also be some argument to the data that that older data is helpful, but its value decays over time as markets evolve.\\n\\nBen: Definitely.\\n\\nDavid: The broader point I want to make here is just that every other major quant farm out there is also spending hundreds of millions, if not billions on this stuff too.\\n\\nBen: And people are looking for alt data everywhere. The bridgewaters of the world are paying gobs of money for things that you would never dream could possibly have an effect on the stock market, yet they’re paying billions or tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars for it.\\n\\nDavid: I think we can rule out scale economies for sure. If anything, there are anti scale economies here.\\n\\nBen: Oh yes. There’s totally economies of scale. Your strategy stop working when you get too much AUM.\\n\\nDavid: You get slippage. I don’t think there are any network economies here. They literally don’t talk to anybody.\\n\\nBen: Although, well, they do have some very well-established relationships with electronic brokerages and different players in the trade execution chain. I think they have very good trade execution and very fast market data. Their ability to pull data out of the market is very high quality.\\n\\nDavid: Do you think it’s actually better than their competitors, though?\\n\\nBen: I don’t know. That’s probably not the secret sauce.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I don’t think so.\\n\\nBen: It’s the table stakes.\\n\\nDavid: Switching costs I don’t think apply, branding maybe applies in their ability to raise money for the institutional funds, but that’s not a big part of the business.\\n\\nBen: The fee stream on the institutional fund may entirely belong to branding. But I think there are a lot of public equity firms and a lot of hedge funds that have a lot of branding power that have on average market returns with decent Sharpe ratios and are able to raise because they’ve built a brand. Venture firms are the same way.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. For me, this leaves counter-positioning, I actually think there’s some counter-positioning here. I think we’re going to have two episodes in a row of counter-positioning at scale.\\n\\nBen: Tell me about your counter-positioning. Who is being counter-positioned in what way?\\n\\nDavid: There are direct competitors in the market, the other quant firms. When I say direct competitors, I obviously don’t mean for LP dollars. I mean for the same type of trading activity.\\n\\nBen: Like they are counterparties in trades.\\n\\nDavid: I don’t think they are counterparties. I think they are all seeking to exploit similar types of trades. I think the counterparties are the people there, the dentists that they’re taking advantage of.\\n\\nBen: Well, but quant funds are often counterparties to each other.\\n\\nDavid: That’s true. But I think yes, adversaries in finding the similar types of trades. I think the counter-positioning for RenTech or for Medallion, specifically, is I do think the single model approach versus the multi-model, multi-strategy approach that most others have, does have benefits like I was talking about in the tapestries.\\n\\nBut I think also and maybe bigger is every incentive at RenTech is fully aligned to optimize fund size for performance in a way that is not true just about everywhere else. I think they have the most incentive of anybody to truly maximize performance we’re able to achieve.\\n\\nBen: Even though the dollars would continue to rise because they get fee dollars from more money in the door. They are incentivized in a unique way that makes it so they’re not willing to trade the dampener on performance to get those dollars.\\n\\nDavid: Particularly because it’s all the same people on the GP and LP side.\\n\\nBen: Oh, we keep going round and round that axle. I loosely buy the counter positioning thing. I just think the answer is disgustingly simple and annoying here, which is they’re just better than everyone else at this particular type of math and machine learning, and they’ve been doing it for longer, so they’re just going to keep beating you.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, that’s another argument I heard from people, in that RenTech basically is a math department in a way that none of these other firms are.\\n\\nBen: It could be culture.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, it could be culture.\\n\\nBen: I mean, honest to God it could just be that the culture is set up in a way that continues to attract the right people and incentivize them in a fake altruistic way. Like this is just a fun place to do my work, and yeah the outcome is getting really rich, but I wouldn’t go work at Citadel.\\n\\nDavid: I think that could be, so maybe that feeds into process power. Okay, for me it is some combination of process power and counter positioning. I don’t think it’s any of the other powers.\\n\\nBen: For me it is process power and cornered resource.\\n\\nDavid: I buy that.\\n\\nBen: A thing that’s not captured in seven powers is tactical, execution. The whole point of seven powers is that strategy is different from tactics. I think legitimately RenTech may just have persistently been able to out-execute their competitors. There’s part of it that’s just like they’re smarter than you.\\n\\nDavid: Well if you buy the whole thing gets reinvented continuously every two years, then yes.\\n\\nBen: And there’s remnant knowledge. If you started building a machine learning system in 1964, you’re going to be really good at machine learning today. The people that you’ve been spending time with for the last 15 years, learning all of your historical knowledge and working in your systems are also going to be better at machine learning than probably the other people who are out in the world learning it from people that just got inspired to start learning machine learning based on the new hotness. Learnings compound is my answer.\\n\\nOkay, playbook. In addition to the three-part David Rosenthal tapestry that you have woven…\\n\\nDavid: I have nothing more to add.\\n\\nBen: …there are a handful of things that I think are worth hitting. The first one is signal processing, is signal processing, is signal processing. By not caring about the underlying assets, they literally don’t trade on fundamentals, except in the institutional fund when they trade on fundamentals a little bit. They use price earnings ratios and stuff like that in the institutional fund, which is funny because that’s a completely different skillset.\\n\\nBut if you just look at Medallion, it’s all just abstract numbers. You don’t actually have to care about what underlies those numbers. You just have to look for whether it’s linear regression or any of the fancier stuff that they do, just relationships between data. Once you reduce it to that, it is so brilliant that they can just recruit from any field.\\n\\nIt’s not relevant how someone has done sophisticated signal processing in the past, whether it’s being an astronomer and trying to denoise a “photo” of a star super far away, or whether they’ve tried to do natural language processing. It’s just signal.\\n\\nDavid: There’s this really funny line that Jim, Peter, and others will say when asked about why they only hire academics and not from Wall Street and whatnot. They’re like, well we found it’s easier to teach smart people the investing business then teach investing people…\\n\\nBen: How to be smart.\\n\\nDavid: Right. That’s ridiculous. They don’t teach anybody anything about investing. They’re just doing signal processing. I bet at least half the people at RenTech on the research side could not read a balance sheet.\\n\\nBen: It’s so funny. It’s a whole bunch of people who are in the investment business, none of which are investors.\\n\\nAnother one that you can decide if this fits or not. I was thinking a lot about complex adaptive systems. It’s always been on my mind since we had the NZS capital guys on a few years ago and read their work and the Santa Fe Institute’s work on this.\\n\\nIn a complex adaptive system, it’s really difficult to actually understand how one thing affects everything else because the idea is the relationships are so combinatorially complex that you can’t deterministically nail down this one thing as the cause of that other thing. It’s the butterfly flapping its wings.\\n\\nBut there are relationships between entities that you can’t understand or see on the surface. Do you remember way back when we did our second NVIDIA episode? I opened with the idea that when I was a kid, I always used to look at fire and think if you actually knew the composition of the atoms in the wood, and you actually knew the way the wind was blowing, and you actually knew that… all the, could you actually model the fire?\\n\\nWhen I was a kid and you always just assume no, but actually the answer is yes. This is a known thing of what will happen when you light this log on fire for the next three hours, and can you see exactly the flames.\\n\\nI think RenTech has basically, they haven’t figured that out for the market. They can’t predict the future. But if they have a 50.01% chance of being correct, then they can take a complex adaptive system and say we don’t really care that it’s a complex adaptive system. Our models understand enough about the relationships between all these entities that we’re just going to run the simulation a bunch of times, and we’re going to be profitable enough from all the little pennies that we’re collecting on all the little coin flips where we have a slight edge over and over and over and over again, that they’re the closest in the world to being able to actually predict how the complex adaptive system of the market will work.\\n\\nNow, I don’t think they can back out to it. No person could explain it, but I think their computers can.\\n\\nDavid: I think when I’ve heard people from RenTech talk about this, they will all say the model does not actually understand the market, but it can predict and we can be so confident in its predictions about what the market will do, that we rely on it. Whether it understands or doesn’t understand, doesn’t actually matter. It can’t tell you why, but that’s okay.\\n\\nBen: But it does know it has a slight edge, so it should trade on it even though it can’t explain why.\\n\\nWell, speaking of models, I’ve been trying to nail down an answer to this question. Do you think RenTech was the birthplace of machine learning?\\n\\nDavid: This is such a tough answer to tell. We actually emailed some friends who are very prominent AI researchers and AI historians and asked this question. The answer we got back is unsurprising. They said, we don’t know because they don’t share anything.\\n\\nBen: It’s like the principles certainly came out of the same math community that spawned machine learning. But is what RenTech has figured out over the last couple of decades in Google’s Gemini model and in ChatGPT…? No it’s not, because they don’t contribute any research back.\\n\\nIt may be the case that actually RenTech has beat everyone else to the punch, and they have a strong AI or something that is actually much more sophisticated than all the AI we have out in the world today, and they’ve just chosen that they’d rather keep it locked up, captive, and make a bunch of money.\\n\\nIt could just be the case that Renaissance is just taking in as much unstructured data as it possibly can, and they were just a decade or two ahead of everyone else in realizing that you can have unstructured, unlabeled data, and if you have enough of it, you can make it, in the case of an LLM, say things that sound right or sound true. Or in the case of these trades, be right more than 50% of the time.\\n\\nDavid: Make trades that sound right.\\n\\nBen: They figured out this big, unsupervised learning thing before anybody else, all the way up until last year when the AI moment happened.\\n\\nDavid: If that were the case, we should have very different answer to powers.\\n\\nBen: To illustrate this point. It’s quite interesting. Peter Brown’s academic advisor was Jeffrey Hinton.\\n\\nDavid: I’m so glad we brought this up. Yeah, it was the exact same stew, the exact same cohort of people, social group, and academic groups that RenTech came out of, that AI came out of.\\n\\nBen: Just for people who are like, why are you saying that? To make it super explicit, the other person whose academic advisor was Jeffrey Hinton is Ilya Sutskever, who is the co-founder of OpenAI. Many years later, but still.\\n\\nDavid: It’s like we were talking about with Markov models and hidden Markov models. That is the foundation of RenTech. That is one of the foundations of AI and generative AI today.\\n\\nBen: Another big one is this concept that you should trade on a secret that others are not trading on. On the face of it, it seems obvious. Of course I should come up with some strategy to trade on that other people aren’t trading on. But I said a couple of words there, which is ‘of course I should come up with.’ Therein lies the fallacy.\\n\\nI think most investment firms try to get their ideas out of people, and then do an incredibly rigorous amount of data analysis to figure out if they should put those trades on or not. I could be wrong, but I do not think modern RenTech does that. I think all of their investment ideas come from data and come from signal processing. Therefore you are going to put trades on that make no intuitive sense.\\n\\nWhen you’re putting trades on that are profitable and make no intuitive sense, you aren’t going to have competitors. If you find a relationship between two things that a human could never come up with or dream of those relationships—and we’re saying too it end things, 10 things, 20 things, 100 things and in various different weights at various different timescales—that is a killer recipe to exploit a secret that no one else knows and be able to beat other people in the market.\\n\\nDavid: Such a good point. Many, if not most, of the other quant firms are not doing that. Some of them maybe, but I think most of them are the model is suggesting things, and there is a person or persons who are the master portfolio allocators that pull the trigger or don’t pull the trigger.\\n\\nBen: To be super illustrative because I think your natural tendency is like, oh I can understand why these two things would be related, the relationship may not be what you figure.\\n\\nFor example, there could be two things that always move together. Tesla stock and wheat futures. You might try to, because humans are storytellers, concoct some story in your head of why those move together, and if you believe it then you might decide there’s some date where they should stop moving together.\\n\\nWell it could very well be that some other big hedge fund just owns both of those things, and when they rebalance it causes those assets to move together. But you would never think of that. You would think these things have a direct relationship with each other, not just that there’s liquidity in the market from both of them at the same time because someone else owns both of them. I think what RenTech admitted is we have no idea why anything is actually connected, but it doesn’t matter.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. That was surprising for me in the research. I assumed that was the whole quant industry and it was very surprising to me to discover that I believe. No, it is pretty much only RenTech and maybe a couple of other people.\\n\\nBen: My next one is brought to you by a friend of the show, Brett Harrison, who has worked in the quant trading industry for a long time, and shared an idea that he has with us, which is that there’s basically this two-by-two matrix. You have on the one axis fast and slow in terms of trade execution, and on the Y-axis you have smart versus obvious.\\n\\nDavid: The way he phrased it to us was smart versus dumb, but dumb doesn’t mean dumb.\\n\\nBen: It’s the obvious trades. The high level point is all quant funds are not high frequency trading firms and vice versa. This is something that I didn’t know not coming from this industry and now makes total sense to me. I think I thought they were the same thing.\\n\\nFast and obvious is your classic high frequency trader. They’re front-running trades, they’re locating in a data center that’s really near the, this is Flash Boys, or they’ve got a microwave line between New Jersey and Chicago, and they’re trying to arb the difference between two markets. You need to have the fastest connectivity in the world to pull this off.\\n\\nDavid: This is Jane Street.\\n\\nBen: Yes. There’s fast and smart, which you don’t need to be both. You don’t need the fastest connectivity in the world and the most clever trades to put on. People tend to pick a lane that they’re either a high frequency trader or they’re trying to make the smartest, most non-obvious trades possible.\\n\\nThat of course leads us to Medallion, which is in the slow and smart quadrant. All the machine learning system discovered the relationships in the data, so there’s a huge amount of compute…\\n\\nDavid: The non-obvious trades.\\n\\nBen: Exactly, that goes into finding the non-obvious trades, but then they’re actually made reasonably slowly. They still have to happen within seconds or minutes, but the advantage isn’t that they’re high frequency the way that all the Flash Boys stuff is.\\n\\nDavid: My sense is RenTech is not a high frequency trading shop. They’re not front running things, they’re not Flash Boys. Compared to you and me, they still operate incredibly fast. But it’s more about the smartness and less about the fastness.\\n\\nBen: Greg has a quote in his book. “They hold thousands of long and short positions at any given time, and they’re holding period ranges from one to two days or one to two weeks. They make between 150,000 and 300,000 trades a day, but much of that activity entailed buying or selling in small chunks to avoid impacting market prices, rather than profiting by stepping in front of other investors.”\\n\\nDavid: This is another thing that we heard. RenTech is world class at disguising their trades.\\n\\nBen: They can make it so that they don’t move the market and you don’t know who is acting or when. This is because in the early days they weren’t good at this and people basically intercepted the trades that they were making and were front running them. They had to adapt and develop these clever systems to make it so you don’t know who’s buying, you don’t know in what quantities, and you don’t know if they’re going to keep buying.\\n\\nMy last one before we get into value creation, value capture is that this is a terrifying business to be in. The amount of controls and risk models that you need and kill switches are just so important. What if the software has a bug? Is it possible to make a ton of unprofitable trades in a matter of minutes and lose it all? That wasn’t possible in the old world where you’re calling your broker. That totally is possible here.\\n\\nDavid: And it happened.\\n\\nBen: While it’s never happened to RenTech, there was a company called Night Capital in 2012 that lost $460 million in a single day. There was a bug in their process to deploy the new code.\\n\\nBasically, what happened was a simple flag error, a misinterpretation of setting a bit from zero to one that caused this infinite loop to run. Once a certain trade happened, it was supposed to flip the bit. It flipped a different bit. The systems were not looking at the same location and memory for the same bit. It basically thought it was never flipped.\\n\\nThis infinite loop ran 4 million trade executions in 45 minutes. There wasn’t the appropriate kill switches built in. They basically watched it all to just drain out, and there was nothing they could do.\\n\\nDavid: The whole portfolio gone, right?\\n\\nBen: Yes. Well, I don’t know if it’s the whole portfolio, but it was enough that they lost a huge amount of LP capital. They were a publicly-traded firm. Overnight, their equity traded down 75%, and then someone stepped in and bought them.\\n\\nDavid: They probably got margin-called by all their counterparties.\\n\\nBen: Whoever is in charge of the financial controls and safety systems at RenTech, that’s a huge job for someone in this industry.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: To kick off value creation, value capture, I have a provocative statement. David, Renaissance Technologies is actually not in the investment business. They are in the gambling business. In particular, they’re the house.\\n\\nDavid: Well I thought where you thought you were going with this, I was like, yes, I would totally agree. They’re not in the investment business. They have no idea how to invest. The model does.\\n\\nBen: I’ll say you this. They’re not investors and they’re not in the investment business. There is investment going on all around them in the markets that they trade in. But the fact that they’re in those markets, they’re not there as investors. They’re there setting up shop as Caesar’s Palace, letting everyone come in and do business with them while they have a slight edge. They’ll lose sometimes, but most of the time they’re going to come out slightly ahead.\\n\\nLet’s say they do have a 50.01% chance of being right. They’re just there to collect their vig on everyone who is willing to trade with them over all these years. At scale it really worked. Jim Simons managed to drain $30 billion into his own pocket out of everybody that he ever traded with.\\n\\nDavid: Now, I think where you’re going with this is perhaps similarly along the lines to Caesar’s Palace or a casino. They are not in the investment business but they’re providing a service. Is this where you’re going with this?\\n\\nBen: Well, the investment business, it depends how you define investor. If you want to be all hoity-toity about it—which in this illustrative example I’m being one—and saying an investor is someone who provides risk capital to a business, for that business to create value in some way in the future. Or you lend money to some intrinsic underlying asset so that it can be productive with that capital and produce a return for you as an investor.\\n\\nOf course, lots of things are called investing that are not that. Is it investment if I put money to work, then I get more money back later, I don’t actually care how the money got made, and it’s actually zero sum, I’m just vacuuming it out of…?\\n\\nDavid: Right, right. The money is not being invested in anything to produce.\\n\\nBen: Correct. But it’s literally the same business model as a casino. You have a slight edge, and you let a whole bunch of patrons come in and lose money to you in your slight edge.\\n\\nDavid: Where I was going with the service provider, I think casinos are service providers. They’re providing entertainment to their customers. Everybody knows that the games are stacked in the casino’s favor.\\n\\nSimilarly, I think you could make an argument—and I think this is probably quite accurate—that RenTech and all other quant firms like them are providing a service to the market, in that they are allowing trades that people want to make to happen faster and at much lower spreads.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely. That is the undeniable, yes, quant funds create value in the world thing, which (I think) it’s very easy to say quant funds provide no value because it’s zero sum, they’re not actually providing the capital to businesses to do something with. They’re purely looking to do an arbitrage or any of the strategies we’ve talked about this episode.\\n\\nBut you’re totally right that there is a value to market liquidity. Creating more depth to a market makes it so that if we go back to the era that Renaissance was started, there’s no chance that retail is able to function like it does today with zero transaction fees and people able to invest in all these different companies at near real time.\\n\\nDavid: And any single one of us can go buy a security in just about any market, at just about any time of day, pretty much instantaneously, and get a very, very, very granular price on it. None of which used to be true.\\n\\nBen: The fact that there is a whole bunch of quant funds, hedge funds out there that are ready to be willing counterparties to anyone who wants to trade, that is a service. You’re right.\\n\\nThey’re also not all Medallion. They actually don’t all have an edge. Even though they might purport to, lots of them are going to lose money to you.\\n\\nDavid: Lots of them lose money. You too, listeners could beat the market. Not investment advice. Please don’t try.\\n\\nBen: On average, Medallion will not lose money to you. But there are plenty of other hedge funds out there, high frequency shops, and counterparties for you where you could take them. That’s just not Jim Simons.\\n\\nDavid: There’s this great, great vignette at the end of Greg’s book. When was it? It was during one of the selloffs in the mid-20-teens in the market, where Jim calls the head of his family office. He’s long retired from RenTech at this point, calls the head of his family office and says, what should we do with all the selloff in the market? And it’s like, you’re Jim Simons.\\n\\nBen: Right. You’re Jim Simons. What should we do?\\n\\nDavid: What should we do, yeah.\\n\\nBen: All humans are fallible.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: A couple of other squintable, the value creation exists. It’s easy to knock that all these smart people are going into finance, and you wish they were doing something more productive for the world. At the end of the day, humans are going to do what they’re incented to do, absent a larger global concern that is incredibly motivating to people.\\n\\nYou look at World War II, people’s level of patriotism and wanting to go save the world from evil was a huge, unbelievable motivating factor to move mountains. When that is absent or when people feel that there’s some existential thing that is absent, they’re going to go do what’s best for them and their family. If they’re an empire builder, go build empires. If they’re fierce capitalists, go make a bunch of money. The system is set up the way that it is. You can be mad about that.\\n\\nGiven that, okay, people are going to go engage in quantitative finance as a lucrative profession. Fortunately, there’s a bunch of valuable stuff that comes out of that. I think that is often missed is that these really lucrative professions and businesses can often produce R&D that becomes valuable elsewhere.\\n\\nFor example, we just did this big NVIDIA series. What do you think Mellanox was used for before large language models?\\n\\nDavid: This is such a really mind-blowing point here in value creation, value capture. Go for it, take it away.\\n\\nBen: There’s not much to it other than a huge amount of InfiniBand was used by high frequency trading firms. I don’t know for sure, but I think Mellanox built their business on quant finance. That’s one of many examples. Now you know that has limits, but I think it goes overlooked that there’s a lot of technology innovation here.\\n\\nDavid: These are all great points they all came up in the research. I totally agree with all of them. It is, in my opinion, false to say that quantitative finance does not create value for the world. It definitely does in my opinion.\\n\\nBen: But does it create anywhere near as much as it captures?\\n\\nDavid: That said, they’re really, really good at value capture. This is not Wikipedia here. This is about as far away on the spectrum as you can get.\\n\\nBen: There’s a great, always sunny in Philadelphia, where Frank—Danny DeVito—goes back to his whatever business he founded in the 80s. He’s in his pin stripes and stuff again, taken back over, and he brings Charlie with him. Charlie like, so Frank, what does the business? What do we do here? What does the business make? Danny DeVito looks at him and he goes, what do you mean? We make money? He’s like, no, no. What do you build? He goes, we build wealth. I think that’s a pretty good meme for what’s going on here.\\n\\nDvid: Totally. Very, very good at value capture, too.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Okay, bear-bull. This was a section that we had for a long time, that we did not put in the last episode, and boy did we hear about it. Listeners, thank you so much for expressing your concern. Bear versus bull is unkilled and it is back.\\n\\nDavid: Resurrected like a phoenix.\\n\\nBen: Resurrected. However, this is about the lamest episode to resurrect it on. What’s the bull case for RenTech?\\n\\nDavid: Past performance is an indicator of future success.\\n\\nBen: They’re going to keep attracting all the smartest people in the world. They’re going to have the ability to keep their incredibly unique culture. They’re not going to get tempted to let the business of institutional funds become the dominant business. Keep on keeping on is basically the bull case. Maybe that they’re actually still ahead.\\n\\nDavid: The bull case for the GP and LP stakeholders in Medallion, which is, I don’t know, 500 people in the world, and none of the rest of us can get any exposure to it.\\n\\nBen: The bear case is things are changing. I think things are changing basically on any axis is the bear case for them. Things are changing where competitors are catching up, maybe. Maybe the fact that the tech industry has figured out these large language models, maybe that trickles into making it easier to compete with RenTech. It’s a blurry line, but it is plausible.\\n\\nMaybe RenTech actually was here a decade before everyone else, and now everyone else has arrived to the party. There are things that are changing maybe about their culture. Jim Simons has been gone for a long time. Bob Mercer is no longer a co-CEO. Peter Brown is a co-CEO and they just announced that they’re making the guy who was in charge of the institutional funds, David Lippe, is becoming a co-CEO as well.\\n\\nMaybe there’s a bear case around that, that someone from the institutional side of the house is becoming the current co-CEO, and maybe eventually CEO if you believe the Medallion is the special thing and the institutional funds are a blemish on the business. They’re the Hermès Apple watch strap in David’s parlance. Maybe that’s a bear case.\\n\\nMaybe there’s a bear case that their talent is becoming the same as everyone else’s talent. When you look on LinkedIn, I recognize a lot of the companies that people worked at, who are more junior at RenTech and in the past. I think it would’ve been all people just out of university research shops. I think if it’s true that they’re starting to see the same talent flow as everyone else, that would be concerning. These things are all narratives you can concoct and really no way to know if they’re true or not.\\n\\nDavid: There’s no way for us to know any of this because there’s no way to know any of this.\\n\\nBen: It’s all a secret.\\n\\nDavid: Our new ending section, the splinter in our minds, the takeaway.\\n\\nBen: The one thing you can’t stop thinking about.\\n\\nDavid: What is the one thing for each of us personally from doing this work over the past month on RenTech that sticks with us? For me, perhaps this is obvious from my little diatribe on the tapestry. I just think this is such a powerful example of the power of incentives, getting them right, and setting them up right. And culture, too. I don’t want to shortchange that. I think the culture of managing an academic environment in a fashion like a lab, but without letting it spin into the frivolity of a lab that Jim Simons set up.\\n\\nBen: In other words, early Google.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. This is like early Google, exactly. There historically has not, from our research and as best as we can tell currently, is not anything going on at RenTech that is frivolous. They are all very focused, which again, to me then speaks back to the power of incentives.\\n\\nWhen you’re there with less than 400 people, and on the research and engineering side less than 200 people, and those colleagues who you work with are the sole purveyors, supervisors, and beneficiaries of all of this that you’re doing, that is so powerful. I can’t think of anywhere else like that in the world. Maybe some venture funds or other investment firms, but not on a day-to-day fully liquid with returns like this. There’s nothing like it.\\n\\nBen: Pure gasoline right into the veins.\\n\\nDavid: Which is not to say I would necessarily want to work there. I think I would not, but it is truly unique.\\n\\nBen: The one thing I can’t stop thinking about is the idea of the complex adaptive system that I was talking about earlier. I think from what everything we can tell from the outside, Renaissance actually has built a large scale computer system that discovers relationships between different entities in the world—stocks, commodities, bond prices—and whether it can explain them or not, it is correct most of the time. It might be a small most, but all you need is most, then you can operate a casino business.\\n\\nThat is my takeaway is that they are the house and they have an edge, and that edge is predicated on a graph of all the relationships between these entities that we think are just noise, and they know the signal.\\n\\nDavid: It does make you wonder to what you were talking about with the tech industry “catching up” in recent years. How hard is it to build this now given the technology open source and otherwise that’s available for sale out there.\\n\\nBen: That’s the bear case. I don’t know.\\n\\nDavid: Then what’s going to happen? By nature, given that it’s a complex adaptive system, if you can now buy and build this, well, the returns will get arbitraged down.\\n\\nBen: Yup. All right. Should we have some fun, carve outs?\\n\\nDavid: Let’s have some fun.\\n\\nBen: Sweet. All right, listeners, I have three. People have been expressing that they’re loving the carve out section, so I decided to load them up a little bit more.\\n\\nDavid: That’s right. Let’s indulge.\\n\\nBen: We’ll spin off a whole new podcast called Carve-outs.\\n\\nDavid: Forty-four percent carry. Let’s go.\\n\\nBen: I have one announcement, one TV show, and one other fun thing for listeners. First the announcement. David and I are going to be emceeing Modern Treasury Transfer again this year. If payments are your thing, you should come join us. It was awesome last year. It’ll be May 15th, 2024 in San Francisco, and we’ll put a link in the show notes to register. We would love to see you there.\\n\\nDavid: Can’t wait.\\n\\nBen: My second one is a TV show, and it is actually Acquired-related. It is called The New Look on Apple TV+.\\n\\nDavid: Oh yes. But Christian, it is such a new look.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. For anyone who listened to the LVMH episode, remember we were talking about the groundbreaking thing that Christian Dior did was his collection, The New Look, that was a post–World War II explosion onto the scene.\\n\\nDavid: Celebration of life.\\n\\nBen: Gone are the days of the militaristic, boxy clothing, and now we are in with these seductive and dare I say…\\n\\nDavid: Sumptuous materials. War rationing is over.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. Provocative dresses. The Apple TV show is this incredible drama of flashbacks to the harrowing wartime experiences of Christian Dior, of Balenciaga, of Coco Chanel, everything they went through, and how all their paths crossed.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, Coco’s in it?\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Oh wow. How do they treat that?\\n\\nBen: It will be very interesting if a lot of people watch this show to see if that affects product sales of Chanel. I’m also very curious for people who are watching—feel free to put a thing in the Slack and carve-outs—do you think she’s a sympathetic figure? Do you think she’s a villainist figure? I’m curious how you think of her portrayal versus reality.\\n\\nDavid: There’s the whole crazy thing with Chanel where the company ends up getting bought by Chanel the perfume division, which is the two Jewish brothers in New York.\\n\\nBen: The Wertheimers. Indeed. Oh God, we got to do a Chanel episode at some point. But The New Look on Apple TV+, I promise you, whether or not fashion luxury is your thing, it’s a beautiful and harrowing story.\\n\\nDavid: As you and listeners know, I’m not a TV guy, but this is so up my alley.\\n\\nBen: The whole thing. It takes place in wartime Paris.\\n\\nDavid: All right. I got to watch it.\\n\\nBen: You got to watch it. My third one is a fun thing for listeners. After our Nike episode, the president of Cole Haan—if you listen to the episode, you now know is its own company spun out from Nike years ago—reached out, and it turns out, he, like all of you, is also an Acquired listener. We were chatting and he brought up the idea that they’d be happy to create a specific Cole Haan deal for Acquired listeners. I told them, frankly, if it’s good enough, then I’ll share it on air.\\n\\nDavid: To be clear, this is not a sponsorship. This is just he’s a fan and reached out to us.\\n\\nBen: And I’ve owned a bunch of Cole Haan products over the years and have really liked them. For 35% off anything, you can go to colehaan.com/acquired or use the code ACQUIRED35 at checkout. Thank you to Dave for providing this to us. This is only live, I think for a couple of weeks, so if you’re listening to this episode soon after it drops, go check it out. I think they intentionally want to cut it off at some point, so it doesn’t get shared around all the coupon sites. But fun thing for Acquired listeners.\\n\\nDavid: Super cool. He likes Acquired and wanted to share the love back.\\n\\nBen: Love it.\\n\\nDavid: I love it.\\n\\nBen: All right, David, your carve outs.\\n\\nDavid: My carveout is related to The New Look in a very different way, but both video consumption, fashion, luxury, and style. It is the Class of Palm Beach, Instagram, and TikTok account. This is so great.\\n\\nBen: David, you and I go to Palm Beach for two days and you get hooked on.\\n\\nDavid: This is amazing. Ben and I went to Palm Beach for a couple of days for a speaking event recently, which was amazing. I’d never been to Palm Beach before.\\n\\nBen: It is nice.\\n\\nDavid: So great. We didn’t knowingly spot any RenTech people there, but we may have.\\n\\nBen: We did knowingly spot some Birkin bags, though.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, the style in Palm Beach. We had just recorded the Hermes episode, and oh man, I was so pleased to be there. Then I got home and Jenny (my wife) was like, do you not know the Class of Palm Beach TikTok account?\\n\\nBen: And David’s like, I’m a thousand. I have no idea what you’re talking about, Jenny.\\n\\nDavid: Right, right, right. I live under a rock. I’m a dad, and she showed it to me. This is a woman who lives in Palm Beach. She goes around, posts on Instagram and on TikTok, and she just interviews people on the street about what brands they’re wearing, their style. It is magnificent.\\n\\nMy favorite is—we’ll see if we can find it and link to it in the show notes—there’s a video of one woman who’s being interviewed who has a Mini Kelly inside her Birkin.\\n\\nBen: Excess, truly excess.\\n\\nDavid: And that’s when I was hooked. I was just like, this is the greatest thing I have ever watched. I’m obsessed.\\n\\nBen: All right. If I use TikTok, I would subscribe.\\n\\nDavid: You can get it on Instagram too.\\n\\nBen: Oh, all right. Good.\\n\\nDavid: I actually subscribed the Acquired account on Instagram to Class of Palm Beach. I don’t know how many people we’re following. It’s not many, but we are following Class of Palm Beach.\\n\\nBen: Look at David opening up our Instagram account. You’re so youthful.\\n\\nDavid: I know.\\n\\nBen: All right, listeners, well, a huge, huge thank you to J.P. Morgan Payments, ServiceNow, and Vanta. You can click the link in the show notes to learn more. David, I know you’ve got some thank yous from folks you talked with and a few of them we did together.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. For sources for this episode who are so generous with their time and thoughts. First, a huge thank you to Greg Zuckerman, author of The Man Who Solved the Market, the canonical book out there about RenTech and Jim Simons.\\n\\nGreg was super generous spending time, talking to us, emailing with us, making sure we’re getting things right. He and the book is the canonical source of Medallion’s Investment Returns. I know he worked so hard to get that table together that is now all over the Internet as it should be.\\n\\nBen: It is crazy. Everywhere you hear that 66% number quoted, and that is from Greg’s analysis.\\n\\nDavid: Truly a service to us, to corporate historians, and financial historians everywhere that he did that research and got those returns.\\n\\nBen: There are a few other primary sources. There’s really not much, so we can actually list all of them here. There’s a congressional testimony of Peter Brown about the basket options thing. There’s Peter Brown doing an interview at GS exchanges, which again, many of the questions were straight out of Greg’s book and the stories told.\\n\\nDavid: It is a funny moment where Peter’s like, where are you getting these questions? How do you know all this stuff? And I’m like…\\n\\nBen: Come on.\\n\\nDavid: They’re in the book.\\n\\nBen: Clearly.\\n\\nThere’s a great book called The Quants, which is a little bit earlier—I think it’s 2011—so it’s not as updated as The Man Who Solved the Market. There are only a couple of chapters about RenTech, but some good stuff in there. Then there’s a good Bloomberg piece from 2016 that we’ll link to. I think between that and The Quants, it was the first time there was really anything at all that was published about RenTech. all those will be in the show notes.\\n\\nOther people to thank, David.\\n\\nDavid: Other people to thank, Howard Morgan who we spoke to, which was so fun to get a bunch of the first round history from him. Then of course the founding of RenTech, partnering with Jim, and investing in each other’s funds and all that. So fun.\\n\\nBrett Harrison, who you mentioned, Ben. Brett is now building Architect, which—I love this; this is so needed in the world—the Interactive Brokers for the 21st century. Well, anybody who uses Interactive Brokers knows exactly the opportunity there, so thank you Brett.\\n\\nThen Matthew Granade, who I spoke with. Matt is the co-founder of Domino Data Lab, which is a great enterprise AI ops platform backed by Sequoia and many others. It allows model-driven businesses and products to accelerate research, increase collaboration, rapidly deliver new machine learning models, all of the things that we were talking about here with RenTech.\\n\\nMatt, before starting Domino Data, came out of the quant world. He was at Point72 and Bridgewater, which isn’t really quant sort of its own thing, but he was a long-time senior employee at both of those firms, and he gave us great, great perspective on the landscape of everybody out there and where RenTech fits in.\\n\\nBen: Awesome.

Unlike every other luxury brand, Hermès: And yet everyone knows who they are and what they represent. But, despite all their iconoclasm, this is not a company that’s stood still for six generations. Unbeknownst to most, Hermès has completely reinvented itself at least three times in its 187-year history. Including most recently (and most dramatically) by the family’s current leaders, who responded to LVMH and Bernard Arnault’s 2010 takeover attempt by pursuing a radical strategy — scaling hand craftsmanship.

      "        \"transcript\": \"Ben: I don't know if you realize this. Hermes is reporting earnings in two days.\\n\\nDavid: Yes.\\n\\nBen: At first I was like, we should probably not do this episode because their annual report comes out in two days. What if we're not current? And then I realized this is Hermes. The short term is of no consequence.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Also, the Hermes annual reports are the most beautiful annual reports ever created in the history of the financialization of mankind.\\n\\nBen: You might think you can't do all of your charts in orange, you need different colors, but you would be wrong.\\n\\nDavid: The illustrations, the themes, you can tell they care.\\n\\nBen: You can tell. All right, let's do it.\\n\\nDavid: Let's do it.\\n\\nBen:  Welcome to season 14, episode 2 of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. I'm Ben Gilbert.\\n\\nDavid: I'm David Rosenthal.\\n\\nBen: We are your hosts. Today, we tell the story of a handbag company that won't sell you a handbag, a traditional saddle maker that makes very little of their revenue from saddles, a company that somehow has grown to be worth over 200 billion despite rejecting manufacturing efficiencies and economies of scale, a company so obsessed with craft and a reputation for quality that they have stayed independent while every other luxury brand has merged into conglomerates.\\n\\nThat's right, listeners. Today, we tell the oldest story we have ever told here on Acquired, older than Standard Oil or the New York Times. This company dates back to 1837 in Paris, France. The crown jewel of the luxury industry, Hermès.\\n\\nDavid: Ben, do you know what company was also founded in 1837 that we have discussed quite a bit on Acquired?\\n\\nBen: No, I do not, David.\\n\\nDavid: That would be the other iconic color luxury company, Tiffany.\\n\\nBen: Really?\\n\\nDavid: Also founded in 1837.\\n\\nBen: Chuck T. This episode, listeners, has been probably just under 12 months in the making. LVMH was just after one year ago, and it was in that episode that I feel like I got a real penchant for everything that Hermes stood for. After 187 years, still under family control, they're on their sixth generation of family leadership at the helm. David, everything Hermes does is just so focused, intentional, and pure. As much as they get lumped together with brands owned by LVMH, they are in many ways the anti LVMH.\\n\\nDavid: We've got a great discussion of that later in the episode. I used to think that and I no longer think that. But after our LVMH episode, you were so inspired by learning about Hermes. You went out and you bought your first luxury object. It was not an LVMH brand.\\n\\nBen: Yes, that is true. My wife and I were on our honeymoon, listeners, after LVMH, so last summer. We were in Aix-en-Provence, and we walked by an Hermès store. I thought that this would be a great time to go in and get each other something as a honeymoon gift. My wife got a little twilly scarf, and I got an Hermès belt. It's the only luxury item I own of any traditional luxury brand.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, as foreshadowed on our holiday special episode a couple months ago.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, if you want to know every time an episode drops, you can sign up at acquired.fm/email. You'll get hints at what the next episode will be and follow up facts from previous episodes when we learn new information. Come discuss this episode with us at acquired.fm/slack. Come check out our second show, ACQ2, where we interview founders, investors, and experts, often as follow ups to these episodes. Before we dive in, we want to briefly share that our presenting sponsor this season is JP Morgan, specifically their incredible payments business.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. We really uncovered the breadth of JP Morgan Payments as we went deep into industry research for our Visa episode last year. Just like how we say every company has a story, every company's story is powered by payments. JP Morgan Payments turns out to be a part of so many of our Acquired companies' journeys.\\n\\nBen: With that, this show is not investment advice. David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss, and this show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. David, I feel like we're starting before 1837.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, but not too much before 1837.\\n\\nBen: All right, we're not going to the Egyptian invention of the handbag or anything like that.\\n\\nDavid: Boy, let me tell you, I was tempted. If you read The Luxury Strategy, which is a great book that we've referenced many times on Acquired, they start back 50,000 years ago. We start in 1801, not in Paris, not even in France. As we've been talking about, the land of beauty, luxury, enlightenment, where Hermes, of course, was founded and is still based today.\\n\\nUniquely, Hermes still does 85% of their production by hand, by Mastercraft's people in France, as we will talk a lot about. But instead, we start in the land of hardness and precision of engineering, of exactitude, the future land of the Porsches of the world. That is right, Germany.\\n\\nBen: A century before the Porsches and Volkswagens of the world.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, where Thierry Hermes was born in the town of Krefeld, which is just outside of Dusseldorf, where he's the sixth child of a family of innkeepers.\\n\\nBen: Hermes, is that a German name? A French name?\\n\\nDavid: Hermes is obviously not a German name, even I know that. Thierry's father was French and his mother was German. Shortly after Thierry is born, he was born in 1801, something pretty major happens in France and then throughout continental Europe that will become very, very important to our story here, and that is that Napoleon comes to power in France. This is the era we're talking about here. Napoleon.\\n\\nBen: We finally did it here on Acquired, your AP European history class has now merged with business history We're covering Napoleon.\\n\\nDavid: He is critical to what is about to happen here. In the aftermath of the French Revolution, Napoleon essentially stages a coup, declares himself emperor, first of France, and then he basically begins conquering all of continental Europe, including Germany. This Napoleonic conquest was, at the same time, both the very best thing that could happen to young Thierry, It leads directly to Hermes.\\n\\nAlso, the very worst and truly worst, all this conquering, this glory of France that we're going to talk about becomes important to Hermes, that's the result of wars. Thierry's entire family, his parents, his mom, his dad, all five of his siblings, are all killed either directly in the Napoleonic wars or by disease and famine as a result of this. Absolutely terrible. The result is that Thierry, by the time he's 20 years old, he's an orphan. He is the last Hermes left.\\n\\nBen: David, 1821, pretty rough time out in the world. Do you know who was born in this year, 1821, and was also an orphan? We have talked about them on Acquired.\\n\\nDavid: Obviously not Rockefeller, which is where my mind first went, because we talk a lot about his dad.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Louis Vuitton himself.\\n\\nDavid: He will also come up here in a minute.\\n\\nBen: Twenty years younger than Thierry Hermes, but also an orphan.\\n\\nDavid: Wow, I didn't know he was also an orphan.\\n\\nBen: Yup.\\n\\nDavid: Wow, it's just crazy. Two orphans, one of whom was German, go on to found the two most important, most French, most luxurious brands and really communicators of status in the modern world. That's wild.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, especially crazy considering they both came from nothing. These people who would create the monikers of the elite of what would go on to be the symbols of wealth and nobility, came from nothing, were orphans, and at their greatest aspirations were craftspeople for the elite. They were almost servants.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. In 1821, Thierry leaves Krefeld, leaves Germany. He abandons his original destiny as an innkeeper. He moves to France, not to Paris, but to Normandy in the north. There, he becomes an apprentice under a master craftsman learning the art of equipage craftsmanship. Equipage is the business of outfitting horse drawn carriages. Who were the customers of horse drawn carriages? Ben, like you're talking about.\\n\\nBen: The nobility.\\n\\nDavid: The nobility. Horses were extremely important to the world back then. The horse was the car. It was the Ford F150, it was the Toyota Camry. It was also the Rolls Royce that drew the carriage, and only the Rolls Royces were the carriages.\\n\\nWhen Thierry moves to Normandy and takes up as an apprentice, he apprentices for 16 years. It's not until 1837 that he finally moves to Paris as now a master craftsman and opens up his own shop in Paris on the Rue Basse-du-Rempart in the 9th arrondissement, which that whole street today no longer exists.There, he establishes himself as really quite an exceptional harness maker for horse drawn carriages.\\n\\nIt's unclear to me at this point if he's using the famous saddle stitch, which becomes so important to Hermes. The reason it's unclear to me is because he's not making saddles. Saddles are what other people are making. It's not that the nobility don't ride horses. They do, but they ride horses like the elite today drive a Ferrari. It's not something they do every day.\\n\\nBen: Right. Their daily driver is a Bentley because someone else is driving them. They have a Ferrari for when they occasionally want to drive a Ferrari. They'll climb in a saddle occasionally, but mostly they're in the carriage.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. When Thierry arrives in Paris in 1837, he pretty quickly starts becoming known as really the best harness maker and carriage outfitter in Paris serving the nobility, which is pretty impressive. Here, he's this immigrant from Germany, apprenticed in Normandy. He shows up in Paris. All of a sudden, he's making the best stuff out there.\\n\\nBen: It turns out he was just really good at the craft.\\n\\nDavid: He had exceptionally good timing. We spoke about Napoleon a little bit earlier. When Thierry finally comes to Paris, at this point, Napoleon I has been defeated in the Battle of Waterloo. That was 1850, and France has now seesawed through a whole bunch of different republics, and the monarchy comes back. It's crazy French history stuff.\\n\\nShortly after Thierry returns, Napoleon's nephew, Napoleon III stages another coup and reestablishes the Empire in France. This is super important, Ben, to what you were talking about earlier about this guy's an orphan. Louis Vuitton was an orphan. How did they become so important?\\n\\nWhen Napoleon III comes to power in France, he does two things. (1) He completely modernizes the city. If people have heard of the Baron Haussmann who rebuilt Paris, that happens at this time under Napoleon III. They transformed Paris from a medieval city with super tight streets. If you go up to Montmartre, those streets around there, that is old Paris. But when you think of the Eiffel Tower, the museums, the grand boulevards, the Champs-Élysées, that's happening right at this time.\\n\\nThe Baron Haussmann, he's like Robert Moses was in New York in the mid 20th century remaking New York. He is given full latitude and direction by Napoleon III to burn Paris to the ground and remake this city as a modern city.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: This is super important for Thierry and Hermes for two reasons. (1) In the old medieval streets in Paris, not that many people were going up and down them. Not that many people were going to see the nobility in their carriages and all their finery. Now you've got the Champs-Élysées, the Grand Boulevard, everything about the gallantry of Paris that we know today, is all on display now. This becomes really important for showing off for signifying your wealth, your status.\\n\\nThe other related thing here that happens with Napoleon and Napoleon III is that status is no longer just about what you were born into. In the old system, the nobility, the royalty, it was like you're born noble or you're not. It's independent of how much money you have, what you do, or what influence you have. Under Napoleon, he brought in this modern idea that you could shift your class. He was essentially a nobody, and he became the emperor of Europe. That'll completely upset the mindset of people.\\n\\nAll this is happening, this is the best thing that could ever happen to Thierry. He's the best artisan, most exclusive crafter of carriageway of equipage. The city is being transformed so that this can all be displayed prominently. Social stratifications are becoming more blurry. People can spend money for the first time to buy status. Great for business.\\n\\nBen: These are the disruption waves that enabled him to create a business.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Before all this, before this era, there's no way that this evolves into Hermes. Honestly, Louis Vuitton and what he's doing with luggage and with trunks, there's no way that that evolves into Louis Vuitton. Speaking of, both Hermes and Vuitton have one really important client, a key influencer, so to speak, that they both land at this time.\\n\\nBen: I remember Louis Vuitton's key client was the Empress Eugenie. Is Hermes the same client?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, the same client. Napoleon III's wife, the Empress Eugenie, becomes a client of both of these men for her carriages, in the case of Hermes, and for her luggage and for her trunks. Actually, I think also for her packing. I think Louis Vuitton was the royal laities, I believe, and he packed the trunks. He was the luggage guy, Hermes was the carriage guy.\\n\\nBen: Which is so funny because that is still, in some ways, both of their legacy today.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, absolutely. Eugenie and everything going on at this time makes Louis Vuitton and makes Thierry Hermes. It's interesting. Vuitton and luggage, that is inherently of the world that's coming, the modern world. The train exists at this point in time, steam engines are a thing, and then the car is about to come, and Louis Vuitton, trunks, and luggage, all translates directly.\\n\\nBen: Right, it's built for the upcoming world.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Not the case with Hermès. Actually today, I think this is one of the biggest strengths of Hermes and they still. The equestrian theme, the horse is so much of their brand. They talk about it so much of their products, the saddle stitching. It's calling back to that other era, that pre modern era where the horse was primary.\\n\\nBen: Right. Hermes is deeply rooted in French history, in Parisian history, and really a key part of how France as a nation has the identity that it has today.\\n\\nDavid: But it would all be irrelevant if the brand didn't translate out of the horse era and into the car era, which was not Thierry Hermes' doing, nor was it his son's doing. Thierry dies in 1878. His son, Charles-Emile, takes over. He apprenticed coming up in the shop in exactly the same way that Thierry apprenticed. He just apprenticed for his dad. By the time he takes over, he's been working in the shop as a craftsman for 20 years.\\n\\nBy the way, this family tradition and way of business continues to this day. Axel Dumas and Pierre-Alexis Dumas, who are the two descendants of Hermes, the sixth generation that are running the company today, Axel is the CEO and Pierre-Alexis is the artistic director, apprenticed in the business. When they were teenagers for five years after school, they went to the atelier, they learned the saddle stitch, they made bags, they made items with their hands.\\n\\nObviously, they also learned the business from their parents, but they're not learning the business the way that the Arnault children are learning the business at LVMH as executives. They're learning with their hands as craftspeople how to make this stuff, which is wild. Axel is the CEO of a $200 billion plus company.\\n\\nBen: It's crazy. To bring it back to the late 1800s, I think the point you're making here is, when Charles-Emile was apprenticing, there was no other example of what this company could become. He thought, why don't I carry it on in exactly the same manner, Thierry, that you did? There's not this grand ambition to innovate and change with the times, it's well how do I learn exactly your craft exactly the way you do it and then continue that?\\n\\nDavid: Right. The business and the craft are intimately intertwined, they cannot be separated. This is a playbook theme I want to pull all the way forward, but it's so critical to understand about Hermes and what really in my mind differentiates it from LVMH. LVMH, as we talked about on that episode, has world class best in the world business executives who partner with world class best in the world creatives.\\n\\nAt Hermes, these are not different people. Obviously, there is a different CEO and artistic director that are both members of the same family and who are cousins. But in spirit, they're cut from the same cloth, they apprentice as creative craftspeople, and they collectively and the family, is in charge as much of the creative side of the house as they are of the business side.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, makes sense.\\n\\nDavid: Back to Charles-Emile and the second generation, he finally adds saddlery to the business. That's his big expansion, he adds saddles. Again, as Paris is modernizing as you can now buy your way into status, for the first time in Paris, you couldn't be seen riding in addition to carriages.\\n\\nThe ideal of what it is to be a noble person or a noble person of status has changed. It's no longer just, oh, I'm a leisurely courtier. It's like, no, I'm Baron Haussmann. I am doing things for the state, for the country. It's like America in its way and the Rockefellers.\\n\\nBen: Right. You're not just famous for being famous, you are famous because you've achieved something, you're in the act of achieving something, or you hold a high office in which you were elected or appointed to get a specific goal done. You're on the move. You got stuff to do, and you got to get there.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly, and you need a saddle for that. Charles-Émile adds saddles. In 1880, he moves the workshop in the store to 24 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.\\n\\nBen: The famous address.\\n\\nDavid: The building that is today known as Le Faubourg by everybody in the Hermes universe. This street and this location is one of the most iconic streets in the world, buildings in the world, headquarters in the world.\\n\\nBen: It was stunning to walk it last summer when I was there. You can feel the presence of Hermes and all the other brands that are there.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré is where the French presidential residence is. It's where the British embassy is. It's where French Vogue is today, probably because Hermès is there and because all of the other luxury flagships are there.\\n\\nCharles Emile runs the business for 25 years. He adds saddles, he moves the company to the Faubourg. In 1902, he retires. His two sons, Adolphe and Emile, who have apprenticed in the business just like him, just like every generation will do for many generations to come, take over. They change the name of the company to Hermes Freres, Hermes Brothers, because the two brothers are now running the company.\\n\\nBen: And they're going to do this forever together, and they're going to be thick as thieves. They are of one mind on how this company should go.\\n\\nDavid: They've been apprenticed together, going to be like Axel and Pierre-Alexis today. Of the two brothers, I think it is fair to say that Emile, who I believe is the younger brother, is the much more ambitious and much more adventurous one.\\n\\nThere's this great story that in the late 1890s, before his father Charles-Emile retires, the young Emile sets off to conquer Russia for Hermes. He literally gets on a train with a notebook and a suitcase filled with miniature versions of the saddles and the harnesses that Hermes makes. He just finds his way into the Tsar of Russia's court and lands him as a customer.\\n\\nBen: That is wild.\\n\\nDavid: Unreal. They have to staff up a whole new atelier with 80 craftspeople to fulfill all the orders for the Tsar in Russia.\\n\\nBen: Whoa.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. This is Emile. He's going places. Right as he and Adolphe are taking over at the end of Charles-Emile's tenure, they decide to introduce a new product. They're not thinking that this is going to be a big thing at the time. Some of their customers, again, now that they've added saddles, once they get off the horse, they want something to carry the saddle and maybe their riding boots with them while the horse is in the stables wherever they're going.\\n\\nThey say, great, we can help you with this. They introduce the Haut a Courroies bag, which translates as the high belted bag to carry saddles and boots for their clients. Like I'm saying here, this was intended to be an accessory to the main business of équipage and saddles, the equestrian business. It's not really practical for anything else. I don't know why anybody else would want a big tote bag that could carry your boots.\\n\\nBen: What's this bag look like?\\n\\nDavid: This bag looks exactly like the Birkins and the Kellys today, except a lot bigger.\\n\\nBen: Interesting. Because you're putting a whole saddle in it, like you're de-saddling your horse, and then you're putting that in this bag?\\n\\nDavid: Yup, but it has the same trapezoid shape. It has the crossover belt, the Haut a Courroies that means the high belted bag. It has the belt. It has the turnstile lock closure for the belt at the top of the bag.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: This accessory that we're going to add to the business becomes the spiritual heritage to the business today.\\n\\nBen: That's crazy. It's like if Apple eventually transitioned to being not the Vision Pro company, but the Vision Pro carrying case company.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Did you get the carry case by the way?\\n\\nBen: No, I'm not going to spend another $200 on that.\\n\\nDavid: That thing looks like a balloon. It's enormous.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and it takes up your whole backpack.\\n\\nDavid: This bag, this accessory that would become the Kelly and then the Birkin, they introduced it just at the right time. It's 1902, as Charles-Emile is retiring. This idea of this bag that you would put stuff in, because you wouldn't bring a bag on a train—if you're of this class, you need a trunk. You need a flat pack trunk that Louis Vuitton is going to make for you. None of these three men could have seen it at the time, but this accessory to the real business of saddles, horses, and harnesses was going to become the perfect transition to move Hermes into the age of the automobile. Before we tell that story...\\n\\nBen: Yes, we mentioned Hermes founded in 1837 as the oldest company we've covered on Acquired, but we might have to caveat that.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Our presenting partner this season is JP Morgan Payments. JP Morgan Chase traces its heritage back to 1799.\\n\\nBen: Over 200 years, incredible. You only survive as long as Hermes or JP Morgan with a relentless focus on the long term and exceptionally high quality bar, and counterintuitively when talking about handbags and banks, technical innovation, which is exactly the JPMorgan Payments' story.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Their current payments business was officially forged a few years ago, but many of the capabilities and products came from different parts of the firm, which were already powering the whole payments industry. You can trace their merchant acquiring to the 90s, their treasury products to well before then, and even their blockchain work started earlier than most in the mid 2010s.\\n\\nWhen they combined all that together under one group, it really became a one of a kind, end of one business, a portfolio of treasury, online commerce, point of sale, global trade, card, cash management, fraud prevention, analytics, and more, a one stop payment shop for businesses of all sizes.\\n\\nBen: Yup. When you move 10 trillion a day in 160 countries and 120 currencies, these learnings really compound. That is exactly the story of their new offering, Embedded Banking. This actually reminds me a bit of our episode on Amazon and AWS on how companies can take internal capabilities and scale them externally as brand new products.\\n\\nIn this case, JP Morgan said, hey, we already facilitate credit card acceptance. We manage KYC and anti-money laundering. We pool money and split across virtual ledgers here. We disperse funds. Wow. We can embed all of these into our customers' marketplace businesses to power their end to end payments for buyers and sellers and lower risk across the whole ecosystem.\\n\\nDavid: While Hermes explicitly avoids ecommerce for their most coveted products, as we will talk about later, for the other 99% of you out there, that's probably not your strategy. You want to do more business online. Large retailers are increasingly adopting a digital marketplace strategy to connect buyers and sellers directly. But for the underlying platform, whether that's B2C or B2B, there's a lot of complexities that come with having a frictionless payments experience. You have to create and manage the seller bank accounts, money movement, and most importantly, who's going to take on the compliance and risk of holding and dispersing the funds, the third party seller or the platform?\\n\\nBen: Yup. Macy's is a great example. They wanted to offer more selection to customers and support diverse owned small businesses at the same time. But Macy's needed a solution to onboard sellers seamlessly and manage the state by state complexity of the payouts. They turned to JP Morgan payments and their embedded banking solutions. which enables a large number of suppliers and their bank account details on a single platform supported by tokenization and utilizing a single API integration. This frictionless and secure payment solution worked, to say the least. Macy's nearly doubled its marketplace sellers in the first quarter of 2023 and increased revenue by 50%.\\n\\nDavid: Whether you're in retail, luxury, or really any industry, there's a clear growth opportunity from having an end to end payment solution. Head on over to jpmorgan.com/acquired to discover more payment solutions driving growth for businesses, whether that's Fortune 500 startups or any stage in between. Also, if you're heading to the retail conference Shop Talk in Las Vegas in March, be sure to stop by the JP Morgan payments booth where you can learn more directly from their team of experts.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Thank you, JP Morgan. Now, David, how was Hermes perfectly positioned for the age of the automobile with this new accessory?\\n\\nDavid: This is wild. I suspect you probably also found this in research, but when I did, my mind melted. During World War I, in 1916, Emile becomes an officer in the French military. The military sends him to the United States to learn about US industrial and military production. He's a leading industrialist in France at this time, shall we say? One of the people that he gets sent to meet with is, do you know about this, Ben?\\n\\nBen: No, I have no idea.\\n\\nDavid: I can't believe you didn't find this.\\n\\nBen: No.\\n\\nDavid: He meets with Henry Ford. He goes to Detroit. He sees the assembly lines. He sees the car, he sees the future.\\n\\nBen: He sees the assembly lines and then he had blinders on? He's like, oh, pay no attention to the manufacturing efficiencies they've got going on over there.\\n\\nDavid: This is what's so funny. No, he's like, this is unbelievable. To the manufacturing efficiency's point, he actually does take some elements of the assembly lines and brings them back to Hermes. It's not like they're anti-efficiency. They're pro efficiency, but in the context of being a craft, non-mechanized human master craftsman built object.\\n\\nHe actually does take some of the production ideas from Henry Ford, but more importantly, he's looking at this place and he's like, my God, there is a Model T rolling off the assembly line every three minutes. Ford at this point is producing half a million cars per year. Everybody knew about the automobile, but this is a different arrow. This is the same time as when we talked about our Novo Nordisk episode about the start of that company, where news didn't reach Europe. This wasn't a global world. Emile getting this window, literally seeing the assembly lines in Detroit, he's like, whoa, Once this war is over, the world is going to change forever.\\n\\nBen: Okay. Emile both figures out how to open business in Russia and goes to America, meets with Henry Ford, understands the automobile is going to change the world.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, he's quite the character, this guy. The other thing he finds in America is, I know you know this one, the zipper.\\n\\nBen: Yes, or as it was originally called...\\n\\nDavid: The close-all.\\n\\nBen: Yes, which really does not have the same ring to it, I'm glad we changed it to zipper.\\n\\nDavid: I couldn't believe this. The zipper was a late 1800s, early 1900s invention in America. It was primarily used for Industrial use cases. In this case, it was zippering closed the hood of a car,\\n\\nBen: I think a military car.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, where Emile first sees it. It's not at the Ford factory. I think it actually might have been in Canada on the later leg of his journey where he sees it on the car. It was also used for opening and closing boots. That is how the name zipper came to be. I think it was the BF Goodrich company.\\n\\nBen: Really?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I believe they made a brand of boot with this close-all function and they called it the zipper, and that's where the zipper came from. Regardless, enterprising young Emile, he tracks down the inventor of the zipper, the holder of the patent in America. He obtains an exclusive license for two years in France. This literally is like the Novo Nordisk episode.\\n\\nBen: Totally.\\n\\nDavid: It brings it back to France and makes the first zippered products. He makes the first zippered jacket ever created anywhere in the world. It is a leather golf jacket for the British Duke of Windsor, the heir to the throne. It's just amazing. For years in France, the zipper would be called the Hermes fastener in France.\\n\\nBen: Yes, that's right.\\n\\nDavid: Just wild. I think they made the right decision not to make zippers the business and instead to stay focused on leather goods.\\n\\nBen: It does show their penchant for innovation, the idea that we can push the envelope forward in functionality and what people would be willing to wear. This guy's a duke, and he's wearing a zippered jacket. I'd imagine that drew some eyes at first.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and a golf jacket literally for use while playing golf, while playing sport. What more modern activity to happen here? Regardless though, the big thing for Hermes that he brings back is, oh, my God, the car is coming.\\n\\nBen: Okay. We're still in Hermes family. Two brothers are running it. What's next?\\n\\nDavid: When Emile comes back and he's running around making zippered jackets, he's collaborating with car companies, it leads to a rift between the two brothers. Adolphe, the older brother, he's much more conservative. He wants to remain in the horse market. He's depressed about the car coming. He's like, hey, I just want to remain a niche leather worker. I'm not really cool with everything you're doing here.\\n\\nBen: This is literally like he wants faster horses of the analogy of like, if you would ask people what they want, they'd say a faster horse. He's stuck in horse land.\\n\\nDavid: Right. I don't know if it was that he had his head in the sand or more just like he didn't want to go build a big company.\\n\\nBen: Right, which I could understand.\\n\\nDavid: Totally, I can totally understand that. Either way, in 1919, Emile buys him out and says, I believe in my ability to lead this company, making this transition into the automobile era. Legend has it that he goes to the craftsman in the atelier above the shop in the Faubourg and says, okay, what are we going to do? What can we make with our hands here in this atelier that will interest our clients today?\\n\\nI think this is still legend around Hermes of like, what can we make with our hands that will interest our clients today? The obvious answer at the time is a version of the Haut a Courroies bag. It's bags for these cars. If you want the most exquisite bags, the most exquisite things to show in your automobiles that you're buying, who better than Hermes and finely handcrafted leather bags and accessories that you can outfit your car in the same way you could outfit your horse?\\n\\nBen: The business is now a meals and the business is now handbags.\\n\\nDavid: Once again, the timing and insight here like Thierry in the original case, what the automobile does, and it's not just automobiles, it's also improvements to trains and improvements to ships, the global rich, the global elite, start traveling a lot more. We're now in the 1920s, the roaring 20s.\\n\\nThis is what F. Scott Fitzgerald is writing about. The visible symbols of wealth. It's when you're home, it's in your car and the bags and the accessories you're using with your car. But you're also out traveling a lot more, you're rubbing shoulders with elite all around the world.\\n\\nThe American elite are going to France. They're going to Europe, vice versa. People are starting to travel around the world. People are traveling to Asia. People are traveling to the Middle East. People are traveling to South America. Emile's going right along with all these people. Your luggage, your bags, that's what you bring with you. That's what you show.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Importantly, it's not just that you're trying to show a label, which is a little bit different than the modern version of luxury. It's that you're trying to have something really nicely crafted. When you show up somewhere, someone should just look at your luggage and go, wow, that is beautiful. Hermes is not yet a recognized brand, so merely slapping Hermes on it won't do the trick. The way to wow the people that you want to wow is through the raw craftsmanship.\\n\\nDavid: The product itself, yes. In 1922, Emile's wife famously complains that the large bag they've been making, the Haut a Courroies, the saddlebag, it's too large to fit through car doors, so she asks for a smaller version. This launches the handbag business in 1925.\\n\\nBen: By the way, by this point, they've put the zipper on a handbag.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, exactly. Speaking of the zipper in 1925, they had ready to wear clothes like the legacy of the golf jacket here. The legend has it that they added clothes because a long time client came in and said, I am fed up with seeing my horse better dressed than me. Who knows if that's true, but it's a nice story. But they really go into this. In this modern world where the global wealthy, the global elite, are traveling, they're seeing each other, what outward signifiers can they supply them? Clothes, in 1927 they had jewelry, in 1928 they had watches.\\n\\nBen: Something interesting that is different than the Hermes you know today, the way that they're adding all of these things, they're finding crafts people who are experts at particular crafts. Exactly what you're talking about, David, a watchmaker. They're finding a watchmaker and they're saying, can we work with you on designing something uniquely Hermes, but you're the craftsperson? We're not trying to build this competency in-house.\\n\\nDavid: It's not right to say that they're licensing products. It is a collaboration, but they are selling products in their stores that are not made end to end by Hermes employed craftsmen.\\n\\nBen: Right. It's interesting, because they're towing this line between first and foremost being a craftsman themselves, being a manufacturer, and being a designer, but also being a retailer, where they're just bringing in other branded goods and selling it in their shop.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. I think all this is being figured out real time. These ideas of retailers versus brands, it was a much fuzzier line then than it was today. What does Hermes do? What does Emile do? They start opening up stores outside of Paris. Where are they going to go? They're going to go to the travel destinations where their clients are going. The first store is in the Côte d'Azur in the south of France, and then they start opening up more stores around the world, again, not necessarily in the Londons, the Romes, or the New Yorks of the world. They're opening them up in the travel destinations.\\n\\nBen: Their mindset around additional stores at this point is it's for the same clientele in all the places that they travel.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and the clientele was primarily French at this point in time.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, or if not exclusively other than the czar.\\n\\nDavid: I suspect though that it was strategic of like, our French clients are going to go to these places, they're going to rub shoulders with the Americans, with the British, and then we're going to have a store there so that those Americans, those British, elite, can go purchase our products there too.\\n\\nBen: Right. This, by the way, is a different retail strategy than what they have today. Today, management insists that the idea is that each store is for the local clientele. We will only expand into an area if we feel that we can serve the local clientele that lives there well. That's a recognition of the maturation of their business. The rich people are going to go find an Hermes store somewhere. It's easy for them to travel somewhere, buy it on vacation. But if we're going to open new stores, we should open it in places where there is a thriving new upper class who can buy the goods locally there in their city.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Now, I think some element of this certainly still exists. You had a nice time going into the Hermes store in X, right?\\n\\nBen: Yes, for sure. But it plays well for me as someone who is on vacation and shopping to believe that I'm shopping in a store that is for the locals. It's less fun to be shopping somewhere that is very clearly created for you as a tourist.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I think they very brilliantly walk this line. The products that the shops carry are very different. We'll get into that later in the episode too. Back to this era, I think we've laid the groundwork of a few critical components of Hermes so far. First and most importantly, the craftsmanship, these things are handmade by artisans with their hands, and the family and the people who own the company are the chief artisans. That goes all the way back to Thierry.\\n\\nWe've talked about the connection to the legacy of French nobility, but not really French nobility. It's like status, but accessible status for the first time in the world and the modernization of the world. We've talked now here about the true modernization of the company in the transition to the automobile era. What we haven't talked about yet and what Hermes at this point certainly is not is this element of whimsy and art that is really, really critical, I think, to the company.\\n\\nBen: Yes. If you've ever been in an Hermes store, you can feel a warmth that doesn't exist in other luxury stores. If you're in a destination with a lot of luxury shops, you'll walk past a lot of bright lights, mirrors, punch you in the face reds, and black and white, and you just feel like there's a lot going on. Then you arrive at Hermes, and it feels warm, it feels soft, it feels welcoming, and it feels whimsical. There's this almost dreamlike color palette that they use, starting with a base of orange and having this explosive rainbow of fun, but in some ways it all feels natural, from the earth, and just whimsy. I think that you nailed it, David, whimsical.\\n\\nDavid: This I think is really a very different thread than the original leather craftsmanship, and it is a critical one in the weaving of the Hermes business. This thread comes from the next generation of the family, specifically Robert Dumas. Emile had four children, but they were all daughters. Tragically, one died young, but the other three grew up and got married. Back in this day, women weren't going to take over the business, unfortunately.\\n\\nBen: Right, same story as the New York times. There was a whole generation of daughters, none of the ox daughters get the business, so it goes over to the son in law, the souls burger, and now it's the souls burger ox family that owns the business in the same way that Hermes is the Hermes-Dumas family. The son in law tends to do well in this early 20th century period of passing it down from, unfortunately, father not to daughter, but father to son-in-law.\\n\\nDavid: In this case, when you read about the Hermes family fortune today, it's the Dumas family that are obviously the CEO and the artistic director that you hear about visibly. But really, I think all the sons-in-laws and all of their descendants become active in the business. There's Robert Dumas, there's Jean-René Guérin, and there's Francis Puech.\\n\\nBen: And these are all son-in-laws.\\n\\nDavid: These are all son-in-laws. Those are the three family names that you still hear about to this day of the Hermès family. Back to Robert Dumas and the fourth generation, he brings this whimsy and real art into the business.\\n\\nBen: The way Hermes describes it today when you read their annual report is they talk about their trademark humor and imaginative flair. Despite the fact that they really are tied to this old French elite, they really don't take themselves too seriously in all their products, especially the entry level ones. The Birkin is the Birkin. Yeah, they'll do some special editions here and there, but there's a weight to that product line. There's an overall playfulness that's exuded from the brand that comes from this era of leadership.\\n\\nDavid: Totally, and this comes from Robert. One of the first things he does when he joins the business is he redesigns the smaller Haut a Courroies bag, the handbag line, into what he calls the Sac a Depeches in 1935.\\n\\nBen: Really great name. It's got a ring to it. I feel like that's going to go be a viral hit and appear on Sex in the City.\\n\\nDavid: Beautiful, beautiful, elegant bag.\\n\\nBen: Sac a Depeches. Hold on to that one, listeners.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. A little later in the 1930s, he introduces the Chaine d'ancre bracelet, which is another iconic Hermes item in their jewelry métier.\\n\\nBen: Wait, David, I can't let you get away with that métier. Please enlighten listeners. I know Hermes sprinkles around French words in all their literature, and it just expects Americans to deal with it. If it's italicized, it's French. You can go look up what it means yourself here on Acquired. David, tell us about a métier.\\n\\nDavid: A métier is someone's work, but in the craftsman's sense. A métier is like a trade. It's like a craft profession. This is what Hermes calls their divisions. I feel gross even just saying the word divisions. There are 16 of them today, and jewelry, of course, is one of the métiers. I feel so much better saying métier.\\n\\nBen: I bet, yeah. There's a levity here in the room now.\\n\\nDavid: Chaine d'ancre in French means chain of anchors, anchor chain. These are anchors like boat anchors. The way that this bracelet comes about is Robert is walking along the beach in Normandy one day, and he's just inspired by the scene of these boat anchors on this foggy beach, so he makes a little sketch in his notebook. He plays with it, and then he decides he's going to turn this into a bracelet.\\n\\nBen: Love it. An important thing to know here is when you're buying Hermes products, they're really not pushing the brand. There is not an iconic, recognizable Hermes H, horse and carriage logo, or bright color that you're supposed to identify. This is really the origin of quiet luxury, where Hermes is handcrafting the highest quality product they can make a single artisan is the person making the good. When you receive it, you really are just aware that it's the highest quality thing made by a single person with their blood, sweat, tears, love, a piece of them left inside.\\n\\nIt's super different than luxury today because it is just not branded, and Hermes hadn't even really developed the iconography yet that would become a Hermes' version of slightly louder luxury. Over the years, if you look at products now, the belts have an H. They incorporate horse motifs into designs on their ready-to-wear clothing, but that really wasn't a thing yet in this era.  Hermes is on the lighter side of branding their goods today, but it's still...\\n\\nDavid: They have to adapt to the market.\\n\\nBen: The customers want some way to let people know that they're wearing an Hermes item, even if it's lower key than other luxury brands, so Hermes builds that for them.\\n\\nDavid: The family talks about this a lot. The words they use is this is not a museum. There is this artistic element to what we do, but we are not a museum. We are a business, we have clients, and we are here to serve our clients. There is this push pull here.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Okay, what year are we that the bracelet is entering the market?\\n\\nDavid: That was in the mid 30s. In 1937, Robert introduces the other key pillar of Hermes products that is less talked about today relative to the bags and the leather goods, but for many, many decades was the bigger business.\\n\\nBen: Yes, I have numbers on this.\\n\\nDavid: Silk scarves, the Hermes classic silk scarves. This is the embodiment of this art and whimsy that we're talking about. The silks that they use are the finest silks in the world. It takes 300 silk moth cocoons per scarf, as they will readily tell you to produce these things. But the designs on them, the artwork on them are whimsical like we said.\\n\\nThe first design, the Jeu des Omnibus et Dames Blanches or the white ladies at play, I guess you could translate that, is based on a woodblock engraving that Robert does. This is what an artist this guy is. He's about to become CEO of Hermes, but he's making woodblock engravings and then making silk scarves out of them. That's the first design that they put out there, and quickly they become a huge, huge phenomenon with Hermes clients.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Fast forward all the way to 1988, when Axel Dumas has his very first internship with the company, this is crazy. Silk was 55% of the company's sales. Leather was only 9%. You compare that to today, it is a completely different story. Leather is 43% and silk and textiles is 7%. There was a run. This was introduced when, David, the 30s?\\n\\nDavid: 1937.\\n\\nBen: 1937 through probably the 1990s, these silk scarves were the Hermes franchise. The reason this took off is it almost became part of the French woman's uniform to have an Hermes scarf as a part of your outfit.\\n\\nDavid: It's funny you say the French woman's uniform. Yes, that is entirely true, but the woman who really popularizes them around the globe is a British woman, specifically Queen Elizabeth.\\n\\nBen: I didn't realize that. Really?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. This is so iconic, Queen Elizabeth. She starts wearing them as head scarves in the 1940s. Queen Elizabeth, she's queen of England for 60, 70 years, and she's wearing these scarves, these whimsical, playful scarves on her head as the queen of England.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating. This is a good time to talk about how these silk scarves are made. I was going to do this later when we talk about their modern day production process, but it turns out that their modern day production process is not that different than it used to be. Here is how Hermes scarves are made today. They are first sourcing the finest silk that they can find, which is now from their owned farms in Brazil. That's where the silk comes from. Only 20 new designs are created every year and they retire old designs. There's a Disney vault aspect to this.\\n\\nDavid: They'll bring them out of the vault.\\n\\nBen: Yes. The pipeline to get a new design into the customers hands is two years. You might be asking yourself like, come on, why is this taking two years? That's a ridiculous thing. Here is the process. They screen print every single scarf by hand.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, there's no digital process here. It's not like you're going to custommake.com and ordering up some Hermes scarves.\\n\\nBen: Right. Some of the design does seem like it involves computers now. If you watch documentaries about the craftsman at Hermes, which there's a couple of good ones we'll link to in the show notes if you want to just watch Hermes crafts people at work, they do seem to be translating designs off of a computer, but it's not like they're hitting command P. That's not how this works. Every single color. of the scarf is screen printed using its own mask, or basically a stencil. If your scarf has 20 colors, it has at least 20 masks that they then squeegee the ink over, and the precision is perfect.\\n\\nDavid: This is like EUV lithography.\\n\\nBen: Yes, I was looking at my wife's twilly scarf, the little wrist or hair tie scarf that we got in Aix-en Provence. I don't know how you do this by hand, and I don't know how you do it by hand 20 times over and over and over for every single layer. If you've ever been to an Hermes store or you own one of these, you just can't believe that this is done by hand without any of the layers being out of alignment. Because if any of them are out of alignment, you ruin the whole thing and you have to start over.\\n\\nIf that's not enough, the masks are also hand etched by a craftsperson. Their entire job is to know how to translate a design into all the different color layers, which they then hand etch. The pipeline is designer, engraver, that's an engraver of each mask, colorist, weaver, printer, and then someone to do the finishing.\\n\\nDavid: All of which are extremely hard to replicate and involve both extreme craftsmanship and extreme taste. The competitive barriers to the Hermes scarf, I think they're way higher than the bags, honestly, even though the bags are a bigger business now.\\n\\nBen: The skills are completely non transferable. This process doesn't really exist, certainly not at scale at any other company. Actually, I was talking to my wife about this. She brought up the idea that it's like Disney imagineers or almost like Pixar employees, where you specialize in this one crazy little piece of the production process that no other company has your same production process. The attention to detail is so staggering that once you enter the Hermes universe, then you're in that universe for the rest of your career because that is where your trade is still practiced.\\n\\nDavid: I think also, as a client too, at least in scarves, if you entered the Hermes scarf universe, you're not buying any other scarves.\\n\\nBen: Totally, and you really like all the lore. Part of what makes Hermes Hermes at this point is their callbacks to their own history. They have a hundred and eighty seven years of history to call upon, and they do so over and over and over again. They remix and they name things after stores that used to exist at certain addresses. It's a universe.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I remember growing up and my mom is half British. I'm a quarter British. To the Queen Elizabeth thing, my mom's Hermes scarves were and are among her most treasured items. You'll note all of this that's happening,  Robert, the innovations, these new products, the art, the whimsy, he's doing all this in the 1930s. This is the Great Depression era. This tells you about Hermes and Hermes clients. They are unaffected. They keep buying. This carries through right to this day. I don't know that there is a more recession insulated business than Hermes.\\n\\nBen: You're exactly right. Twelve months now after we did the LVMH episode, we're finally on the tail end of this pandemic bubble of luxury, and we're seeing a lot of these brands take a hit. Hermes is the most insulated of all the luxury brands, where they have the least cost sensitive clients.\\n\\nDavid: After this, there's World War II. Famously, before the war, Hermes products came in cream colored boxes. Robert was very meticulous about the packaging that his crafted items and his art would come in, and it was cream. It had to be cream. During the war, there's a shortage of packaging materials, they can't get cream. The only color that is available to them in the quantities that they need is orange. That was designed for patisseries, for bakeries.\\n\\nBen: Is that what the orange ones were used for?\\n\\nDavid: That's why there was an excess of it because it was used for bakeries, and bakeries weren't baking as many croissants and pain au chocolat during the war, et cetera. There's all this orange packing material. Robert embraces it, and the Hermes orange box is born. This is crazy. I didn't know this till research. Hermes owns this color. You cannot get Hermes orange anywhere else. Pantone does not list it in their colors.\\n\\nBen: It's interesting you say Hermes owns this color. You are correct that Hermes has selected a non Pantone color, but what Hermes tries to do is say, well, we own orange. We can't be nailed down by a Pantone specific code, we own orange more broadly. They've actually gone head to head with the EU. This has gone to court where it's been determined that no, you can't own orange. You can't just own all the oranges.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing.\\n\\nBen: What they've done is they've actually leaned into this, where there is a classic Hermes orange, but it presents differently on each of the leathers. They have 10 different leathers or something like that that they work with. When they die those leathers, it presents a little bit differently. They have this, sure, there's a digital perfect representation of the color of classic orange, but there's this whole spectrum of the way that it shows up on leather. They've even further winked at all of us by creating five or six other oranges.\\n\\nThey have Hermes fue, which is the fire. They have Hermes sanguine, which is this red hot orange like lava. Or they have the Hermes moutarde, which is their mustard. Each of these is a little bit of, I think it's to continue to assert that we own the whole spectrum of oranges, but it's definitely to be able to stay current, stay present, encapsulate the theme of a season, because every year they pick a theme, so they play with their oranges a little bit to evoke the whimsy that they want from this year's theme.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. There's this metal level or corporate level playfulness to this too, of we own all the oranges.\\n\\nBen: Totally. The Hermes oranges are almost to continue the Disney analogy. It's almost like the people that go to the park and look for the hidden Mickeys. It's a way to even more deeply participate in the Hermes universe.\\n\\nDavid: A few other things that Robert adds over the years, he adds the men's silks métiers, aka ties.  The legend behind that one is pretty great. Supposedly a number of gentlemen were refused entry to the casino, thus went to the neighboring Hermes shop next door, and said, can you take some of your beautiful silk scarves that cut and tailor them into ties for us so that we can enter the casino? I'm sure that's apocryphal, but adds to the legend here.\\n\\nBen: They are these patterns. They're just as intricate as the scarves. There's less storytelling that happens in the tie. The scarves tend to be something you could frame, put on the wall, look at in 16 different ways, and the story behind it. When you look at it, you can't believe that it was hand screen printed.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. After World War II, Robert decides that Hermes needs a logo. Taking inspiration from the 19th century painting, le Duc Attele, Groom a L'Attente, which means Hitched Carriage Waiting Groom, the famous Hermes logo is born. The logo is the callback to the carriage. It's the nobility. I find it really interesting, especially at that point in time that Robert decided. You could imagine a galloping horse or something like that would be the appropriate logo.\\n\\nBen: No, it's so genius.\\n\\nDavid: No, it's the carriage.\\n\\nBen: Yes, it's to intentionally ground the brand in history in something that they were a part of that is only theirs, because nobody else starting today is going to have that as a part of their history. They're leaning into the thing that makes them unique, special. The almost defensible durable asset that they have is that they participated in that era that has a nostalgia about it.\\n\\nDavid: And no longer exists.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Horses in the equestrian world still exists. It's obviously not what it once was, but it still exists. The carriage world is gone. It's just a dream these days, and that's what Robert is so good at, this dream. The other thing we have to talk about are the window displays. You referenced this a little bit earlier.\\n\\nHe hires first, Annie Beaumel, and then she's soon joined by the legendary Leila Menchari. Specifically, these two women come from theater set design just to design the window displays at the Faubourg at the flagship store on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore. There are whole museum exhibits just dedicated to these window displays.\\n\\nIt's not like, again, you walk by XYZ other store, even the most prestigious brands and it's like the products are there. Here are the products, here's the brand you're buying, here's the LV, et cetera. These displays, it's a dream. There are probably some Hermes products in there, but it's like a museum exhibit. It's artwork.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and art is exactly the right way to put it. There is no utility to these displays. These displays, much like any advertising that you see of Hermes today, it's not about the product, it's about how you feel. I think this is an interesting place to revisit this idea that we talked about on the LVMH episode of luxury versus premium, where premium means you pay more and you get more utility out of a given product.\\n\\nI pay for a bigger storage space on my iPhone and I get more utility out of that. I can store more photos. Luxury means you pay more literally because it doesn't create more utility. It is either more pleasing to you intrinsically for the feeling, or it's an extrinsic signal where you are signaling to others that you have the means to spend on this item, even though it doesn't provide more utility. It's a despite rather than a because.\\n\\nArt does fall on this spectrum. Art is like luxury taken to its logical extreme. It has actually zero utility. A Birkin bag is a piece of art, but at least it also carries your stuff around. Luxury products are this interesting midpoint between extreme functionality but also artwork. When you buy an air mass product, you aren't just buying the product, you're buying a piece of art a piece of their heritage, a feeling that connects you to the maker and the place it was created.\\n\\nYou're trying to buy a piece of Hermes' heritage and reputation, and hoping to adopt it as a part of you, as a part of your identity. You are seeking whether it's conscious or not to let other people know about this too. You're not necessarily trying to signal it to everyone, but you do want to signal it to the right people who would appreciate it.\\n\\nDavid: There's this genius aspect to what Hermes is doing and what Robert's doing with the arts like these window displays. The Luxury Strategy book talks a lot about this. When you're selling luxury items, they can't just be art. They need to have some utility to them. You will never see any of these brands, Hermes included, become art galleries. They're not selling paintings, but it's critical for luxury brands to have a connection to the arts.\\n\\nI think you realize this before anybody of like, the windows in our stores are these portals into this world of dream and art. You'll come in and you'll buy a scarf that you'll wear. You'll buy a bag that you'll use. Maybe you'll buy a tie, maybe you'll buy a wallet, homewares, furniture, or any of the other things over time that they sell. That will have utility, but it's connected to this dream.\\n\\nBen: Yes, you're taking a piece of that dream with you, and it's almost a daily reminder of the dream that you're now participating in. The key insight is that by adopting art as a critical piece of the bundle that is your product. It enables you as the seller to completely switch tracks to disconnect from any evaluation of value.\\n\\nDavid: Right, or features.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. You're out of the feeds and speeds world. You are not being comped against, well, this other purse is much cheaper and serves the same function. Now, we have bundled in the function of the object and an unevaluatable...\\n\\nDavid: Priceless feeling.\\n\\nBen: A priceless feeling. Now, we can sell the goods for whatever we want, because it's impossible to know the value of that second component that we've bundled in.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, totally. Speaking of dreams, we're now in the 1950s in the post World War II era, the most amazing, unbelievable, fantastical dream of the 1950s happens to Hermes in real life. That dream is Princess Grace Kelly.\\n\\nI mentioned a little while back that one of the first things that Robert did when he came into the business was redesign the handbag and christen it the Sac a Depeches. It becomes popular, but we're talking about leather goods, handbags, important, but that was the previous generation of the business. Now under Robert, it's the scarves, it's the dream, it's all this stuff. Leather's part of it, but a smaller part.\\n\\nIn 1956, Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco, this is a girl from Philadelphia, an American girl who goes on to become a movie star, who then goes on to become Princess Grace of Monaco. I can't imagine a bigger dream for any woman or any person in the 1950s. She is photographed using the Sac a Depeches in Life magazine.\\n\\nBen: On the cover of Life magazine.\\n\\nDavid: The legend is that it was on the cover of Life magazine, but I googled a lot of 1956 covers of Life magazine, and I didn't find it on the cover.\\n\\nBen: Interesting. Maybe that's been played up over time.\\n\\nDavid: This might have become part of the lore. Regardless, big picture in Life magazine. She is clutching her beloved Sac a Depeches to her midsection.\\n\\nBen: It's almost like as she's exiting a building. It almost seems like it's a paparazzi type photo.\\n\\nDavid: It's a paparazzi photo. Her husband, Prince Rainier of Monaco is holding the door behind her. It's the most dreamlike thing you could imagine. It's in black and white. The reason that she is clutching this fairly large bag, unbeknownst to the world at the time, is she's trying to hide her pregnancy from the paparazzi. She's pregnant with her first daughter.\\n\\nThis photo just becomes iconic. Everybody wants to be Grace Kelly. Everybody wants to have this bag. One of the last things that Robert does right before he retires in 1977 is he officially changes the product name of the Sac a Depeches to the Kelly bag. This is the birth of, I don't even know what to call it. The Kelly and the Birkin are ends of ones, but these leather good products that transcend everything, that are so truly N of one. There's no other way to describe them.\\n\\nBen: There is so much to say about these bags, how they're crafted, the lore around them, and the supply, demand, and the econ 101. Before we get to that, this is the perfect time for another story about ServiceNow. ServiceNow is one of our big partners here on Season 14 and is really an incredible company.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. ServiceNow digitally transforms your enterprise, helping you automate processes, improve service delivery, and increase overall operational efficiency all in one platform. Over 85% of the Fortune 500 runs on them. Today, they are the 76th largest company in the world by market cap. That's wild. They're coming up on Hermes here.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. That story is really the story of their CEO, Bill McDermott. When he took over in 2019, the idea that this just 15-year-old company would be bigger than Nike or Pfizer soon was insane. ServiceNow was the leader in enterprise IT automation. But what Bill has done since, like we talk about all the time on the show, is evolve that product into a true solution for the entire enterprise.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. It's just like our NVIDIA series. Moving from product to solution makes you an essential partner for your customers, which lets you build real enterprise value. Bill is the best in the world at this.\\n\\nBen: Bill's story is great. He started his career at age 17 in a very different business. He bought his local corner deli in working class Long Island.\\n\\nDavid: As a high schooler. This is amazing. He buys the deli for $7000 in seller financing from the owner who is retiring. Bill realized that the kids like him who hung out at the store weren't coming there for the product. Sure, they wanted food, but it wasn't about the sandwiches. It was about hanging out with your friends. That was the solution.\\n\\nThis was the 1970s, Bill starts installing arcade cabinets, Pac-Man, Space Invaders, everything we talked about on our Atari and Nintendo episodes. Guess what, kids spend way more time there, and Bill makes way more profits than just selling sandwiches.\\n\\nDavid: He literally made life changing money from this deli. He buys his parents a beach house.\\n\\nBen: After college, Bill joins the tech world in sales, rises through the ranks at Xerox, and eventually becomes CEO of SAP. But he's always bringing that mindset. Why are my customers really here? When he joined ServiceNow in 2019, he takes them from, oh, you can make it function better, to you can digitally transform my entire company.\\n\\nDavid: The company's performance since then has been incredible. Honestly, it's like Hermes over the past couple of years. Revenue has doubled, earnings have nearly 10x'd since 2019. Bill and ServiceNow have entered the conversation with the NVIDIAs, the Microsofts, as the most important technology partners for enterprises around the globe.\\n\\nBen: If you want to learn more about the ServiceNow platform and see how it can transform your business, go over to servicenow.com/acquired or click the link in the show notes. When you get in touch, just tell them Ben and David sent you. Okay, David, Life magazine, the Kelly bag. It's out. This thing must sell like hotcakes, right?\\n\\nDavid: Yes and no. Certainly, this plays right into this whole dream thing that we've been talking about and burnishes Hermes' already incredible brand and image. My god, Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco is carrying this bag, not just carrying this bag, but it's her favorite bag, the closest thing to her body. But we're still in the fifties here, so yes, it becomes incredibly popular.\\n\\nYes, I'm pretty sure it becomes Hermes's biggest selling bag, but the market isn't quite there yet in the way that it is today with the Birkins and the Kellys. The global rich isn't that big of a population. I'm sure they're all buying Kellys, but Robert probably knows all of these clients personally at this point. We're not anywhere near the scale that we're talking about today.\\n\\nBen: To your point, I keep saying it's launched. It's not really launch, they just rebrand to the Kelly bag. When the Kelly bag is formally launched, it's really expensive. It's a $900 handbag in the 50s, which today is $10,000-$12,000, approximately the price of a Kelly bag today. It comes out that as this thing that is completely ridiculous and inaccessible price wise, the people who are buying it are the Grace Kellys of the world, and there's not really this stratified class below that that's got this huge amount of purchasing power.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The number of people who could spend the equivalent of $12,000 on a bag back then was just much, much, much smaller than it is today.\\n\\nBen: Yup, exactly. No, handbags do not immediately become a huge part of the business or I should say the dominant whatever it is today, six or seven times larger than silk part of the business right away.\\n\\nDavid: In fact, actually, sadly, quite the opposite happens. As we head through the 60s and into the 1970s and the end of Robert's tenure and his generation as the head of Hermes, the company starts to fall on hard times.\\n\\nBen: Which is crazy to say. I remember this moment in the Porsche episode, you're like, no, come on, Porsche skinnied down the entire lineup to only making the 911 because they couldn't justify any of the other products, and the whole company was a freaking mess. Hermes is not quite in those dire of straits, but they have the ingredients of Hermes that we know today. They've got the Kelly bag, they've got the orange box. They've adopted the logo.\\n\\nDavid: They've got the scarves.\\n\\nBen: They've got the scarves. They have these small workshops where they make everything, but it's not working yet.\\n\\nDavid: It's particularly not working because like we just talked about, that market was not that big yet. As we entered the 1970s, something really funny happens. The next generation rejects that dream. This is you and me, our parents' generation, the hippies, the 1970s. This is democratization. Little girls don't want to be Grace Kelly anymore. They want to be Stevie Nicks or something like that.\\n\\nThe dream of Hermes that was once so elegant and so desired by so many people but inaccessible, it certainly still got its audience, but it's not as universal. This is when so many of the other what we now think of as luxury brands really start to come up. We talked about this on the LVMH episode, but they're connected to fashion. It's first Dior, and then it's Yves Saint Laurent. This is the Mondrian dress from Yves Saint Laurent. This is the revolution. It's Gucci. It's Chanel in the 80s when Karl Lagerfeld takes over. What they're selling is very, very, very different than what Hermes is selling.\\n\\nBen: This is an important distinction between Hermes and all the brands you just named. They come from the world of couture, of fashion, and of cutting edge, in your face, risky art. Mind you, by this point, they're already 120 years old, 130 years old. They come from the world of leather, horses, durable goods that stand the test of time, and frankly, styles that stand the test of time. It's not how creative and crazy we can be, they talk about it as responsible growth.\\n\\nWhat's the smallest amount that we can move from our current compass in order to do what our clientele wants while staying true to our roots? It's a rejection of risk and an almost embrace of history. It's super different than most other luxury brands, which as you point out come from fashion.\\n\\nDavid: Right, and those brands are getting born or reborn right there in the 1970s.\\n\\nBen: Yes. David, this is probably a good time to share who we chatted with in preparation from this episode and his observation about Hermes.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This was super cool. One of the things that for me and for both of us just blows our mind as Acquired grows. We got to talk with Domenico De Sole, who was CEO of Gucci, during the fight with Bernard Arnault that we chronicled. Really, I think that was the best part of our LVMH episode.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely. When Domenico De Sole, Tom Ford, and that team rejected Bernard's takeover and managed to not become a part of LVMH. Obviously, then Domenico and Tom Ford left to start Tom Ford after that.\\n\\nDavid: It was super cool. We talked to Domenico. He comes from that world. Even with the heritage of Gucci, he and Tom, it was fashion first in his perspective. I think the perspective of many folks that are coming out of this 70s, 80s era of luxury, that's what's interesting. That's what's fresh.\\n\\nBen: Risk on, baby.\\n\\nDavid: Risk on, yeah.\\n\\nBen: Let's figure out how to break some glass in what we're doing.\\n\\nDavid: Grace Kelly is not breaking any glass.\\n\\nBen: Right. That Domenico helped us understand about Hermes is they have been so protective of their brand and this unbelievable steward. They're so careful at how they've chosen to deploy the brand. They make sure that the mystique is always there. They don't violate the promise. They never cut corners.\\n\\nThey have been above board in their brand promise and keeping that promise with customers for over a hundred years. That is a strength and a weakness. It's a strength as long as you learn how to employ it as a strength. In the world of fashion, it's butting heads.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, it's antithetical to fashion.\\n\\nBen: Yes, exactly.\\n\\nDavid: All this culminates towards the end of the 1970s as Robert is nearing the end of his tenure at Hermès and the end of his life. Sadly, there's a moment. This is in probably 1977 or so, where they bring in consultants and the consultants recommend like, hey, you guys should probably do what Gucci is doing. You should probably close the atelier above the shop at the Faubourg, you should probably outsource production, and you should probably increase your number of products, your SKUs, have lower prices, and have them be more accessible.\\n\\nBen: Unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: That was the accepted wisdom at the time. I don't know if it was McKinsey or who was saying that.\\n\\nBen: Today, I will tell you that Hermes has a corporate policy of no consultants, and now I know where that came from.\\n\\nDavid: This is enshrined in the luxury strategy is anti law of marketing number 19, do not hire consultants.\\n\\nBen: Wow. The recommendation was to come in and destroy everything that makes you special and follow the playbook that everyone else is running.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. It's working for them, and it's not working for Hermes.\\n\\nBen: It's crazy.\\n\\nDavid: This is when the next generation transition happens to Robert's son, Jean-Louis Dumas. I can't believe it with this family. Every time they come in at a generational transfer, and the company and the brand is under existential threat, even though we think of Hermes as the most unassailable thing in the world right now, but finds itself at a moment where it can be assailed. There's a generational transfer happening. You would think this is the downward spiral. This is the dropping of the baton, and the next generation always rallies.\\n\\nBen: Isn't it amazing? You would think the best person out there to brilliantly come up with both the business strategy and the creative element is probably not your direct descendant.\\n\\nDavid: Right, probably not your nepotistic family member.\\n\\nBen: That's not the best search process to run, and yet it works. I don't think it's this magical bloodline. I think it is a deep understanding of the tradition of the business, of exactly what type of chutzpah the team has to rally and take on, having the political clout to find the right people, and empower them to make the change, to have a sixth sense for where you sit in the marketplace versus competitors and what people may want out of your brand next. It's all the intangibles that come from growing up in the business make you able to be the right person to transform it.\\n\\nDavid: I really do think that there is an element too of the successive generations, they apprentice in the ateliers with their hands. I think there is an element of that. They also apprentice, especially these days on the business side too. Axel talks, all the time, about dinner table conversations between his uncle, Jean-Louis, who we're about to talk about now, who is the fifth generation CEO of Hermes and his mother, who was head of production at the dinner table growing up. You can't not absorb that.\\n\\nI think that's the flip side of nepotism, which makes it such a challenging topic. On the one hand, obviously limiting the universe of talent. On the other hand, how do you replicate those dinner table conversations?\\n\\nBen: It's funny. I called it a sixth sense. I think the right way to describe it is actually a je ne sais quoi about what you absorb from those.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Okay, Jean-Louis, the fifth generation. The consultants are saying, hey, go be like Gucci.\\n\\nBen: Shut down your shop, where they still today make Birkin and Kelly bags by hand one artisan at a time in the most famous address in all of luxury and fashion. Not so.\\n\\nDavid: I do have to correct you there. That is not specifically true. It's certainly spiritually true. I believe now, the only products that are made in the Faubourg are saddles. I think everything else is made in Pantin, which is a 20-minute drive away. It's not like the outsourced production. Anyway, we'll get to that.\\n\\nBen: Great.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, Jean-Louis comes in.\\n\\nBen: What year is this?\\n\\nDavid: 1978.\\n\\nBen: Great.\\n\\nDavid: He, like all the generations before and after him, come up. He apprenticed in the business. He knows how to do the saddle stitch. It's in his hands, it's in his soul.\\n\\nBen: We've talked too many times without actually talking about the saddle stitch. It's time to actually talk about saddle stitching. Listeners, you might be wondering, why do they keep saying this? What does it mean? Saddle stitching is an amazing technique that Hermes uses for every single bag that they make. I can't tell if this is true or not. It can either only be done by hand, or until recently only be done by hand, but it is a far more effective, high quality, and durable form of stitching relative to the typical machine sewn stitching that you're thinking about right now, where the same thread goes through one needle and it goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.\\n\\nDavid: It's also incredibly beautiful. It's got a slight diagonal valence to it as opposed to the normal straight line stitching.\\n\\nBen: Yes. How does it work? There's something called a horse that goes between your legs. The horse holds two pieces of leather together. The whole point of the saddle stitch is to sew two pieces of leather together. You first punch little holes in the leather using likely a pricking iron as your method of doing this. If you're good, you don't prick all the way through. You just poke a little hole with your pricking iron or all part way through, so that way you don't poke too big of a hole. You only end up pushing exactly a hole the size of your needle and thread through.\\n\\nYou can always tell. If you're looking at something and it's stitched, there are these big freaking holes, then there's this thin thread that's moving through, and there's space between the thread and the leather, you know what kind of craftsmanship went into that. If it almost looks like the stitch vanishes into the leather and you're like, is there even a hole there, it's hard to even see how this was done, that is a saddle stitch. You take your pricking iron or your awl, you poke the partial hole. There's a lot of muscle memory involved in this. You then pass one needle through going from the right to the left side, and then you have a second needle...\\n\\nDavid: On the other end of the thread, so one thread two needles.\\n\\nBen: Yes, that you pass through the other direction. What you've done as you pull both of them through is created this incredibly strong interlocking mechanism.\\n\\nDavid: There's tensile force going in both directions.\\n\\nBen: Yes. If it gets ripped, you're not at risk of the whole thing pulling out, your saddle, or your bag falling apart. You just lose that one stitch, and that one stitch can be repaired. The only way for you to unravel something that is saddle stitched together is to individually go through and cut every single stitch.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, compare that to most products that you own.\\n\\nBen: Yes, this literally provides high utility if you're in an equestrian jumping competition or if your bag needs to hold something that really needs a lot of protection and can't fall through. It's almost like it started with real necessary utility, because something life threatening could happen. Now it's just massively overkill for everything that is saddle stitch, but you appreciate the craft behind it. There are very few people who are in a life or death circumstance that are dependent on their stitch holding true.\\n\\nDavid: I'm going to channel my inner Pierre-Alexis here, the current artistic director of Hermès. I think it still has relevance if you want your object to be permanent. If you want an object that you own to represent something wholly different and antithetical to the Amazonification or the Walmartification of items these days, you want it to be made like this.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Something that made this really special for hundreds of years, if not still, is that it had to be done by hand. If you want something of this quality, this gets this interesting idea, is handmade stuff better? Not necessarily. Axel even says this in an interview. He says in 2019, today, hand stitching is the highest quality, so machines are non negotiable. When the quality of a machine stitching gets better than hand stitching, we will do it. We are not a museum.\\n\\nDavid, this is where you're getting your, we are not a museum quote from. But it really gets to this element of, why are handcrafted goods desirable? In this case, it literally creates something higher quality, more durable, certainly more aesthetically pleasing, since when done well, you can't see that hole in between the thread and the leather. It's a pretty special process.\\n\\nFor everyone who's wondering, okay, but what is the rest of creating one of these bags look like, start to finish, a Kelly bag, and we'll talk about working in a little bit but similar story, is made by one craftsman. One craftsman starts with 36 unique pieces of high quality leather.\\n\\nDavid: As much as possible from the same animal and matched exactly.\\n\\nBen: Yes, exactly. It's not sourced from all these different places all over the world, one person is responsible for the bottoms, and someone else is responsible for the straps. It is one craftsman that takes these 36 cuts and stitches it together. It takes 20 hours. This is over the course of a few weeks to create this. One person assembling it all, putting the fasteners on it, stitching it. This takes two years to learn how to do before you are allowed to create one for the first time.\\n\\nDavid: I think it's even more than that. It's two years of training to become a Hermes artisan, period. I don't think you're allowed to touch the Birkins and the Kellys when you start day one on the job. I believe you need at least another three years, if not more, before you're allowed to touch the Birkins and the Kellys.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating. This knowledge is passed from generation to generation. Hermes refers to this as the savoir faire or the know how or the expertise about the materials and the exceptional technique that's transmitted from one craftsperson to another.\\n\\nDavid: Hang on to this. I have a lot more to say when we get to the current generation about this.\\n\\nBen: I'll stop after this, but I thought this was pretty funny. Have you read the annual report, the 600-page document that they release once a year?\\n\\nDavid: I have to admit, I have not read it cover to cover.\\n\\nBen: You did more of the history, and I did more of this.\\n\\nDavid: But I've read large sections of it.\\n\\nBen: I was reading it. I found myself laughing at how often savoir faire was used in the prose. Every other paragraph, they just throw in a savoir faire, 133 times savoir faire is referenced in the Hermes registration document.\\n\\nDavid: Partially in their defense, savoir faire literally translates as know how. It's a proper term in French.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, fair. I think the takeaway is real that this knowledge is transmitted from one generation to the other in the very same way that it was from father to son all the way back at the founding of the company. That is how they scale production. I will put a pin in that and come back to it later.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. The true genius of the current generation is they have scaled that to 7000 people.\\n\\nBen: It's unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: Unbelievable. I was going to talk about this towards the end of the Jean-Louis era, but I want to say it now because I think it's perfect. I got to talk to a woman named Beatrice Amblard, who lives here in San Francisco.\\n\\nThis is amazing. She was an artisan at Hermes in Paris. She was hired right at the start of Jean-Louis's tenure. She worked in the atelier at the Faubourg when Jean-Louis's son, Pierre-Alexis, current artistic director, came to train after school as a teenager. He sat next to Beatrice, and I got to chat with her about this.\\n\\nBen: She runs April in Paris in San Francisco?\\n\\nDavid: She moved to San Francisco when Hermes opened the San Francisco store here. I was like, oh, you transitioned to the front of the house. She was like, no, no, no. I was the person for the West Coast who repaired everything for North American West Coast clients. There was one person in New York, and I was in San Francisco. We came from the Faubourg, and a few of these people go around the world.\\n\\nOne of the things about Hermes and actually Jean-Louis who said that the true essence of luxury and the true essence of Hermes is everything they make can be repaired. If you buy an item from Hermes, no matter what it is, they will repair it.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, I think that's true.\\n\\nDavid: Even if it's 100 years old, you bring it in, they will repair it.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, that's true. This is flashing forward to today, 15 dedicated repair shops worldwide, and they mend 120,000 pieces a year.\\n\\nDavid: Wow, amazing. I asked Beatrice when I was talking to her, what was this like? What was special? She said, look, you have to understand, when I was training as a young person and decided I wanted to go into this field, Hermes was absolutely the greatest company that anyone could hope to work for. It wasn't even close. There was no comparison.\\n\\nBen: What years?\\n\\nDavid: This was in the late 80s, early 90s. She said, look, I decided that either I was going to get a job at Hermes, or I was going to leave this industry and go do something else. It is in that high of a steam. I said, oh, well, why? She said, look, by the time we're at this era, nobody else was left that did this.\\n\\nEverything we talked about in the 1970s, all these other brands all went in this complete other direction. The consultants were telling Hermes to go in that direction too, but they're the last one standing that did all of this by hand in the tradition handed down through hundreds of years. If that's important to you, there's no place else. You can't ply your trade doing that anywhere else.\\n\\nI asked her then. I was like, okay, well, as for the products and to the clients, to the customers, why does that make a difference? What she said is what you'll hear the family talk about all the time. She said, look, it's about soul. This product has a soul. Somebody made that thing with their bare hands. That means something. There's nobody else, certainly at Hermes at scale, that does that.\\n\\nShe ended up leaving Hermes and starting her own boutique here in San Francisco, April in Paris, and she actually also runs her own leather school here in San Francisco too to train artisans. You can get custom stuff, small boutique stuff. Beatrice is a worldwide master, you can get that from her. But the idea that a $200 billion company at scale would be doing this. There's nobody else.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, it's nuts. It's completely insane. The people who don't work for Hermes, your options are in the dozens. If you go as a customer and you want something like a saddle stitched bag, wallet, or something like Hermes would make in that traditional pre war, early 20th century fashion, there aren't that many other artisans out there. Hermes employs 7000 of them. I don't know how many other ones there are, 1000, 2000.\\n\\nIt's not like Hermes has cornered the market. They're hiring more people and training them as fast as they can. They're trying to preserve this market that otherwise would have entirely been zero. It's a pretty crazy thing that they've managed to scale even to the scale that they're at.\\n\\nDavid: The other thing Beatrice said to bring it back to Jean-Louis, he is a legend. He really cared. The idea that he would follow the consultants, it was just so completely anathema to him. He's the artistic director and CEO of the company. She ran into him in the elevator in the Faubourg right after she started. He looks at her and said, you're Beatrice Amblard, welcome to Hermes. He knew everybody by name.\\n\\nWhen she ended up leaving in 1997 to open her own store, he called her. He was genuinely shocked. Nobody ever leaves. What are you going to do? She explained that she wanted to be entrepreneurial, start her own thing. Shortly after the San Francisco Chronicle did an article about her, he found the article, read it in France, cut it out, and mailed it to her with a note of congratulations handwritten.\\n\\nBen: It doesn't cost me anything to do that. On the one hand, you just say they're being a kind person and gave so much to your house for so long.\\n\\nDavid: On the other hand, this is the CEO of Hermes.\\n\\nBen: Right. I think it's important to realize, these individual craftsmen are entirely non competitive with Hermes. It's a completely different value proposition to the customer. When you're buying Hermes today, you don't start from a place of, you know, I think I want some of the very best sewn leather goods I can find. Let me evaluate the whole landscape of people who could deliver that for me, and then I'll decide which maker to go with.\\n\\nEither A, you're doing that, and you are a person who knows about a bunch of individual leather craftsmen, which is rare. Or B, you actually just want to buy something from Hermes, and there's not any evaluation going on. Maybe there is between big luxury brands, but probably not, the value proposition is not you have a need for a leather good, and you can bake off all the competitors. It's you either want something from Hermes, or you're a different type of customer.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Okay, Jean-Louis story. How did he turn this thing around and save Hermes from the consultants? Like we said, he'd apprenticed just like every other generation. But unlike any other generation, or I guess maybe like Emile back in the day going and meeting Henry Ford, he comes to America. Specifically, he came to America to follow his wife, Rena, who became a world famous architect. Rena was interning with IM Pei in New York.\\n\\nBen: Really?\\n\\nDavid: Rena Dumas would go on to design all the stores that they opened up all around the world and design the atelier in Pantin when they expand production.\\n\\nBen: IM Pei, famous from a number of things, including previous acquired episode with Michael Ovitz, designed the CAA building in Los Angeles designed the Louvre Pyramid.\\n\\nDavid: I was going to say. Think about the connections here in France and Paris.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. By the way, everyone in Paris thought the pyramid was hideously ugly at first relative to this 1700s building around it. Over time now, it's become this iconic triangle pyramid, beautiful signature of the city.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Jean-Louis, when he's in America, he works for Bloomingdale's. Bloomingdale's, my god, of all places.\\n\\nBen: There was a heyday of department stores. In fact, if you go way back, do you know how Hermes entered the United States?\\n\\nDavid: In partnership with Neiman Marcus?\\n\\nBen: Yes, 1930s. Good. Wow, you did find that.\\n\\nDavid: It's hard to stop me, but you do it sometimes.\\n\\nBen: Okay, Bloomingdale's.\\n\\nDavid: From that experience being in America, being in this much more mainstream audience, he comes to understand what these other brands are doing, what the consultants are suggesting, but he takes that back. He says, look, the way forward is we're going to figure out how to make Hermes relevant. We're not going to throw away everything we've done. We're going to keep our tradition, we're going to keep our craftsmanship, we're going to keep our market position. But our clients want to be like these young people, particularly these young women. The moms don't want to be like their moms, they want to be like their daughters.\\n\\nBen: It's a tall order to figure out how to revitalize, rejuvenate, and make Hermes relevant for this new era with this new audience.\\n\\nDavid: With the same products. This is key.\\n\\nBen: Right. Keeping the same products and not violating everything that Hermes currently stands for. We talked about this on LVMH, the Not Your Mother's Tiffany campaign. It's almost like, how do you not insult your current customer base by adapting for the next one?\\n\\nDavid: This is such a tight needle to thread to use a pun here. They need to run the Not Your Mother's Tiffany campaign without actually running the Not Your Mother's Tiffany campaign.\\n\\nBen: Right.\\n\\nDavid: The first thing, in 1979, the first year he takes over, he launches a new ad campaign in Paris with young Parisian women wearing the iconic Hermes scarves. Remember, that's the main part of the business at this point in time, but it's all these old people who want to be like Queen Elizabeth wearing the scarves. Young women wearing the scarves, not how you would typically wear a scarf, different parts all over their body. It's the Hermes version of Not Your Mother's Tiffany.\\n\\nMost importantly, they're wearing these scarves with jeans. Grace Kelly would never wear jeans. I don't know if she ever did wear jeans, but she sure as hell wouldn't be photographed wearing jeans.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: These ads are the scarves the Queen Elizabeth is wearing with jeans and in fun, interesting ways, playful ways to wear the scarves, but they're still the same scarves.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: This is a revolution. The rest of the family is really upset about it, but he pushes it through. You can still see echoes of this to this day. A big part of Hermes fashion and probably the biggest part of I think the scarf fashion these days is tying the scarves on your bags, on your accessories, on various parts of your body. Not wearing them like your mother wore them.\\n\\nBen: This is how they've adapted for the digital era too. They've come out with five or six different apps to try to figure out how we engage people in the mobile era. One of the ideas that they had was this app that basically gives you suggestions and all the different ways you could tie a scarf.\\n\\nDavid: That's super cool. I think this is brilliant, because this is allowing Hermes to exist and be relevant alongside fashion without actually getting into fashion themselves. The scarves and then ultimately the bags, can be the accessories to your jeans, to your fashion to your—we're past the era of bell bottoms. but the spiritual equivalent of bell bottoms here. They can say something about you, but they're still the same products that they always were.\\n\\nBen: It's pretty interesting if you can figure out how to coexist alongside cool, fashionable new cutting edge things. Then you deserve a place in someone's lineup where they say, well, I both am embracing a current trend, but I'm also respectful of the past. I also found my own way to weave this high class, high status thing into the rest of my image. I think that especially at their price points, they're serving someone who wants to raise one hand and say, I look cool and raise the other hand and say...\\n\\nDavid: I'm classic.\\n\\nBen: I'm classic, and I have the money to spend on things that are very price anchored. Everyone knows what a Kelly bag costs. It's gone up a little bit, but Hermes has very high price point products that stay approximately that price forever.\\n\\nDavid: Jean-Louis has a quote about this, which is very French. He says, \\\"The young customers came to us more than we went to them. People saw again, but with a new eye, the beauty of materials worked by fine hands. They came, we followed.\\\" That's the most French way of ever saying this, but this is what we're talking about. He got their client base and often the young people's parents who wanted to be more like the young people here to see with new eyes the same things. Total genius.\\n\\nBen: Yup, for sure. Okay, that's brilliant.\\n\\nDavid: That's on the product side and doing this jiu jitsu to reposition the products in Hermes. The other thing that he did, which was huge was he had the very same realization that Henry Racamier had at Louis Vuitton, and we foreshadowed this earlier. What Racamier figured out at Louis Vuitton in the 1970s was that the market now, the global wealthy, the global elite, the global rich, is so much bigger now than it was in the 1950s. The number of people with wealth on the order of Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier of Monaco, or even a few rungs below them, but the number of people who can be in our client base around the world is just so, so, so much larger than it used to be.\\n\\nBen: And it's happening in this country by country way, which is perfect for a brand like this. They can go to America, and then they will observe the rise of Japan, and then they'll go to japan in the 90s and 2000s. Then they'll observe the rising upper middle class of China, so they'll go there and present day. They can really position themselves as the second mover, where they can watch and see when this wealth class exists somewhere, then set up shop, and say, hey, France's whole heritage is now available to you to adopt as part of your persona.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and this is super key. I think to this day, it's a huge part of the defensibility of Hermes and Louis Vuitton too. No matter where you live in the world and no matter what your cultural background is, when you attain this status, there's still something about this connection to French and European nobility that you cannot buy from a brand from any other country.\\n\\nBen: It's super fascinating that French nobility, fashion, and heritage is universally revered everywhere. Italian is too. I would say European generally, but French specifically, has an ability to do this in any geography as it develops.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. All of this stew comes together in 1984 with Jean-Louis's greatest achievement. Unlike the Kelly bag, which again was an accident, yes, it was his father Robert and incredible genius, and then repositioning and renaming the bag, the Kelly bag. Jean Louis, this is literally whole cloth conceived of by him, was on a flight from Paris to London in the early 1980s, where he's seated next to the French and British actress, Jane Birkin.\\n\\nBen: The It Girl of the time.\\n\\nDavid: Here's what's really interesting. I bet 95% plus of people listening to this right now have no idea who Jane Birkin was.\\n\\nBen: Which is so funny because in interviews with her, as the Birkin bag was blowing up or at least getting a lot of attention, an interviewer joked that she was going to be more famous for the bag than for her acting career, her modeling, and all that. She laughed and said, wouldn't that be something?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, right.\\n\\nBen: Totally, 95%, if not more of the listeners to this podcast will have no idea who Jane Birkin is before this episode.\\n\\nDavid: But you definitely know the Birkin bag.\\n\\nBen: Yup, or at least you know of the Birkin bag. I'd bet 7 out of 10, maybe 8 out of 10 people listening to this couldn't spot it. But if you say a Birkin bag, you know that it's unattainably expensive, high status, hard to get handbag.\\n\\nDavid: Certainly if you follow the Hermes stock, you know what a Birkin bag is, even if you probably couldn't pick it out of a crowd.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Anyway, this is the culmination of everything we've been talking about. Who is Jane Birkin? She was British. She was born in England, but she moved to France and became a French citizen, and she became a French cultural icon. Again, the tie to France is so important here too.\\n\\nWe didn't talk about this with Grace Kelly either. Grace Kelly was an American from Philadelphia, but she became the princess of Monaco. These two women, these two personas that are embodied in Hermes, Hermes doesn't do celebrity advertising. I think it's so important that even though neither of them were French, they became so deeply European and what they represented.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, that's a great way to put it.\\n\\nDavid: For Jane Birkin, she was this next generation. She was an actress, both in film and theater. She was a singer. She was incredibly beautiful. She was the It girl, but in a very, very different way than Grace Kelly, she wore jeans. In particular, she had a trademark accessory fitting with the 1970s.\\n\\nBen: The basket?\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Counterculture, back to the land type ethos. She carried a wicker basket with her everywhere that she went.\\n\\nBen: Which has an ethos to it, but doesn't lend itself well to overhead bins.\\n\\nDavid: No, it does not. As the two of them, Jean-Louis, CEO and Artistic Director of Hermès and Jane Birkin, French cultural icon, are boarding this flight to London, they're seated next to each other, and Jane is struggling to get her fixed handle wicker basket up into the overhead compartment. At this point, Jane had become a mother and had kids. She had kid stuff in her basket.\\n\\nBen: She had baby bottles that were spilling out.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I carry a lot of kid stuff these days. You need a lot of stuff with the kids.\\n\\nBen: By the way, how crazy is it that the Kelly bag was to hide a pregnancy, and the Birkin bag was designed to carry baby bottles?\\n\\nDavid: Baby forward, yes. I get it. On the one hand, this is esoteric Birkin lore. On the other hand, I think this is super important to Jean-Louis. Imagine the older generation Hermes embracing this.\\n\\nBen: You know what we should do? We should come out with a $15,000 diaper bag.\\n\\nDavid: Right. They sit down and they start talking on the flight. Jean-Louis introduces himself. He's like, I noticed you're struggling with your wicker basket there Miss Birkin.\\n\\nBen: And she doesn't know who he is at first. It's the funniest thing.\\n\\nDavid: Right.\\n\\nBen: She says something like, well, yeah, wouldn't that be great if there was a bigger bag that actually closed? But Hermes doesn't make that, or she made some comment. He goes, I am Hermes.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. The legend now. Who knows if this is true? She said, well, when Hermes makes a diaper bag, I'll use that one.\\n\\nBen: Specifically for her, she fancies herself someone that has a lot of stuff and wants to bring all my stuff with me, so I just need a big bag, and it needs to close easily. Fashion be damned, I just need a huge freaking tote.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. As they get to talking, they're talking about the Kelly. She's like, look, Kelly's the Kelly, but I can't wear it over my shoulder. Jean-Louis starts sketching out designs on the plane, and voila. The Birkin is born.\\n\\nLarger than the Kelly, but smaller than the old original Hermès bag. It's a tote bag, and it has two handles unlike the Kelly, which has one handle, and so with two handles. You can put it over your shoulder. It's the—it feels weird to say more casual version of the Kelly, given that it's the Birkin bag, but it is. It's the more casual modern version of the Kelly.\\n\\nBen: The Kelly has cleaner lines and this beautiful, almost mid century trapezoidal shape, whereas the Birkin, everything about it screams function.\\n\\nDavid: Here's what's interesting. They released the product in 1984, and it is not an immediate success. I think part of this is that the Hermes brand transformation modernization was probably still underway. When you watch interviews with particularly, Pierre-Alexis, he'll talk about this. He's like, any other company would have given up on this product. But it takes about five years before the Birkin bag becomes the Birkin bag. The time is right. We're in the 1980s, the go-go years. These are the years that are shaping Bernard Arnault here.\\n\\nBen: There are tons of American wealth being created. People are looking to be a little bit flashier. Now, granted Hermes is the least flashy of the luxury labels you could adopt, but people know the brand.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. It takes five years for it to become any modicum of success for Hermès. A lot of these things, this just slow burn starts that grows, and grows, and grows, and grows.\\n\\nBen: There's a real lore around it that it's hard to get. It's just like with a kid. If you tell them they can't have something, they wanted a lot more. If you tell your very fancy clientele that you would love to be able to get something for them, there's just not enough.\\n\\nWe don't have it today, but gosh, if you are a great customer of ours and we maintain a relationship with you, let me write down your number. I feel like we may just have something for you soon. It could be a few years, but I'll reach out as soon as we have something. You're an important customer of ours. If you want to show us you're an even more important customer, please do by all means. And I'll see what I can do.\\n\\nDavid: Ben, you would make a great Hermes essay.\\n\\nBen: I don't think so. I actually had a wonderful Hermes associate that I worked with in the Aix-en-Provence store. It was crazy. We bought basically the most entry level Hermes products that you can buy in one of their stores. I think perfumes are sold in department stores and makeup. There are some more accessible things, but in terms of the durable goods, it started at the bottom.\\n\\nI had a delightful time and decided to buy something. I think we spent an hour and a half, and I had the most wonderful service and built an almost friendship with the associate who helped us through the whole process, spending as much time with me as they spent with someone coming in to pick up their Birkin bag. It was crazy, probably the best customer service I've ever received in any retail establishment anywhere. No, I don't think I would be a good Hermes sales associate relative to where the bar has been set.\\n\\nDavid: It's funny. My experience was different. Of course, I had to go do some research for this episode.\\n\\nBen: You drove down to the Palo Alto store, right?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, I went to the Palo Alto store. I had to be down there anyway for some meetings. The sales associate who ultimately helped me is equally wonderful woman. I had a great experience. Her name is Susan. I'm going back to see her tomorrow as Valentine's Day and Jenny's birthday is coming up. I walked in the store with the intention of buying what I ultimately did buy, which is...\\n\\nBen: Apple watch band. I thought that's what that was.\\n\\nDavid: An Apple watch band, yup. We'll get to the Apple partnership in a little bit. I was passed around between a few different people in the store until ultimately, Susan helped me out. She was great. I think she actually might be a higher level essay. But when I expressed that I was there to buy an Apple Watch, Ben...\\n\\nBen: Interesting.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I don't know if that was just the day in the store or if that is part of the policy.\\n\\nBen: I have to imagine it's a little bit different experience in the French countryside as compared to...\\n\\nDavid: The Stanford shopping center.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, I can see that. Back to the Birkin bag, by 2001, it becomes so widely known that there is a waiting list, an almost secret shrouded in mystery waiting list to get one of these things, that it is the main storyline of a Sex and the City episode. Samantha figures out that there's a way to jump the five-year waitlist.\\n\\nDavid: The scene where she walks in to try and buy it is just iconic, where the sales associate is responding to her like, it's $12,000 or whatever. Like oh, I know. There's a waiting list, of course.\\n\\nBen: She name drops one of her celebrity clients and In order to say, it's actually for them to try to move up the waitlist. Calamity ensues, they actually figure out that it's for her, not the client. I actually haven't watched the episode, but this is a cultural touchstone for the Birkin going from something that is whispered about in handbag circles and well-known by the wealthy elite to something that is now a very well known phenomena, which is good luck ever getting a Birkin bag and the crazy stories about the most expensive one ever selling for $500,000 on the secondary market, and Victoria Beckham having a collection of over a hundred. It's crazy. It has become the Patek Philippe Nautilus of handbags, and people look at it almost as an investment.\\n\\nDavid: A way of summing up what you're saying is the hard thing about buying a Birkin is not coming up with the money.\\n\\nBen: Which is crazy. It's starting at $12,000 handbag. What you're saying is that's actually not the constraint.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. But also what you're talking about, with echoes of our Nike episode here, the minute that you are in possession of a Birkin bag, you could immediately sell it for a lot more than what you paid for it.\\n\\nBen: And your Hermes essay will not be very happy that you did that, because the point of buying one is to own one, use one, and appreciate the craft, the work, and the beauty that went into this product. Hermes is not trying to sell it to people that are going to flip it. They're trying to sell it to valued customers who will be people who appreciate the Hermes dream for the rest of their life.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. That would be the last Birkin bag that you'll ever buy. Every bag, I think maybe even every item that Hermes makes, has what Hermes calls a blind stamp on it. This is a series of symbols and numbers.\\n\\nBen: There's one on my belt right now.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, and some on my watch band right now, that are stamped into the leather that uniquely identify that item, the year it was made, and the craftsperson who made it.\\n\\nBen: There are some very cool stories of people who are transitioning from a crafts person who makes goods to repairs them later in their career and who receive an item back for repair, where they were the original creator of that handbag. That is the coolest, craziest, full circle Hermes moment for any Hermes craftsperson to see. This thing that I made that I really wanted to be durable and stand up in the world. How did it actually perform? To get it back 10, 20 years later and see it has got to be crazy cool.\\n\\nDavid: Yes.\\n\\nBen: Today, everything we're talking about here, the Birkin bag, the Kelly bag, these $10,000-$100,000 retail handbags, depending on the type of exotic leather and everything, and the scarcity are referred to as a category of Veblen goods. This is essentially the opposite of everything you learned in econ 101.\\n\\nDavid: As is everything about this company.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Normally, price is where supply meets demand. As the price of a good increases, demand for it would go down. A Veblen good is the opposite. As price increases, people actually want it more. Price ends up being a signal that the item is desirable, and thus it stimulates demand now.\\n\\nInterestingly, David, this is exactly what you were talking about before. Birkin bags sell below the market clearing price. That is another defiance of microeconomics. Normally, things should Be priced exactly at the intersection of supply meeting demand.\\n\\nDavid: I was just laughing as you're talking about Veblen goods there. I whipped out my copy of The Luxury Strategy and flipped to anti-law of marketing number 13, raise your prices as time goes on in order to increase demand.\\n\\nBen: It's so interesting. But one way to look at this is, oh, it's lost revenue. Their prices aren't high enough because they can only make so many of them, and they're selling them below the price people are willing to pay, so there's money left on the table. Another way to look at it is that it's an investment in the brand.\\n\\nThere's a very good Substack writer, 310 value, that will link to in the show notes, who observed the supply demand mismatch creates scarcity in these two bags That scarcity likely creates more demand for the bags, elevates the overall status of Hermes, and creates demand for Hermes' other products, as customers buy Hermes's other goods to build a relationship with the company in hopes of being allocated a bag at the below market retail price.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This is the same dynamic with I think a very different set of motivations as we talked about on the Nike episode. I very firmly believe that Nike could sell many of their shoes for two, three, four, or five times the price that they do. They'll show up on Goat or StockX all the time regularly at higher prices than Nike releases them for. I believe that the reason that they do this is to maintain goodwill with their customer base and maintain Nike's image as a brand that is accessible to everyone.\\n\\nHermes is doing the opposite. They want this to happen in order to maintain the image of Hermes, specifically the Birkins and the Kellys, as a brand and a product that is not accessible to everyone.\\n\\nBen: Yes. It's not as simple as, well, they just keep raising the prices to make people keep wanting them more. You read that in The Luxury Strategy, and many luxury brands do that. In fact, Chanel has done it in record amounts the last couple of years. I think it's called the Chanel classic flap medium or something like that. That's had this crazy appreciation over the last few years where Chanel is just raising the price. Hermes doesn't do that.\\n\\nDavid: We'll talk about this more later in the episode. By my very back of the envelope calculations, they are raising their prices on average across the entire line, 7% per year for the last 10 years.\\n\\nBen: So it's like 4% or 5% above inflation?\\n\\nDavid: Yup, which is more, but not an egregious amount.\\n\\nBen: Right. There was a study that found that the Birkin 30, which is one of the sizes in Togo leather didn't even equal the rate of inflation in the US. I'm trying to figure out what the motivation here is because it's a tremendous restraint. There's no cash grab happening. Maybe it's because, what bad things would happen to Hermes if they decided, you know what, Birkins are 20 now, not 12?\\n\\nDavid: Right. They're already viewed as the most expensive handbags in the world. What harm done to go from 12 to 20?\\n\\nBen: Right. They sell a lot of them, so that actually would be a lot of profit dollars.\\n\\nDavid: Right. For somebody who's going to spend 12,000 on a handbag, are that many more of those people going to be price sensitive at that swing from 12 to 20? Probably not.\\n\\nBen: Right. The Wall Street Journal estimated in 2020 that there's about 120,000 of the combined Birkin and Kelly created each year, so 120,000 bags a year. If you decide that you want to make another 8000 of pure profit on each bag, that is tempting. I think it actually says a lot about Hermes' obsession with conservatism that they don't meaningfully increase the price.\\n\\nThe Kelly is not far above its original 1950s price, inflation adjusted. I think the Birkin bag, the retail price was around $2000 when it launched in 1984, so call it maybe 6000 inflation adjusted. You're looking at maybe twice the price that it launched out on an inflation adjusted basis.\\n\\nI guess the point I'm making here is, I think we should keep in the back of our mind the rest of the episode this question of, why doesn't Hermes raise the prices? They're already getting the benefit either way of the trickle down of people participating in the Hermes ecosystem to hopefully get the call one day. Why not make it even more expensive when you do get the call?\\n\\nDavid: Interesting. All right, let's come back to that later in the episode.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Okay, 1984, Birkin release, doesn't sell well for the first five years, then it becomes this cultural touchstone and gain steam every year after that.\\n\\nDavid: I was just thinking about that as we were chatting here. This makes sense to me that it wouldn't be a hit right away. Because it takes time to build the lore and aura around this bag, you can't just drop a new product and have it become this immediately in this category.\\n\\nBen: Correct.\\n\\nDavid: You're never going to have like an iPhone of luxury handbags.\\n\\nBen: Correct. It has to be like a Taylor Swift concert. Actually, I think it's a reasonable comp that her concert was extremely scarce, brand new product, priced at an extreme premium. That did sell right away, because the product had so much of the brand in it, like you knew exactly what you were going to get from going to the Taylor concert because you're extremely familiar with the brand. But it's not necessarily well understood that the Birkin equals Hermes in the way that The Eras Tour equals Taylor Swift.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. It's also that the product was The Eras Tour, the product was not Midnights. If it were like, oh, I'm going to go to Taylor's concert and listen to her play all the songs on the new album, of course a lot of people would still go. But it was like, no, I'm going to go to Taylor's concert and hear all of Taylor.\\n\\nBen: All the amazing Hermes scarves from over the years released out of the vault.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, the Disney plus of Taylor. All right, different episode here. Okay, back to Jean-Louis. This is how he does it. He does two incredible things to save the company. (1) He repositions the prem. I can't believe he pulled this off. He pulls off Not Your Mother's Tiffany without saying Not Your Mother's Tiffany, and the culmination of that is the Birkin bag and everything that that represents. (2) The internationalization, discovering, and running the same playbook that Racamier ran at Louis Vuitton.\\n\\nBy the end of Jean-Louis' tenure in 2006, a couple of years after the famous Sex in the City episode, Hermes has gone from well less than a hundred million dollars when he took over. The consultants were saying, outsource, shut it down, essentially. By the end of the decade of the 80s, he was just under half a billion dollars in revenue. In 2006, he's taken it to $2 billion in annual revenue. From nice family business to this is a real, real thing.\\n\\nBen: One more time on those numbers.\\n\\nDavid: I don't know the exact revenue figure when he took over, but let's call it $50 million in annual revenue. We know it was well less than a hundred to 42 billion when he retires in 2006.\\n\\nBen: So 40x in 30 years?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, 40x in under 30 years.\\n\\nBen: Wow.\\n\\nDavid: Pretty good. Pretty transformative for the family business. Along the way, as the company clearly becomes more and more valuable, remember, he is the family member who's running it, but we're now on the fifth generation of the family. We're starting to bleed into the sixth generation of the family. They're now over 80 family members out there. Many of whom are involved in the business, but many of whom aren't. Now this business that they all own is doing $2 billion a year in revenue at very, very high margins. There starts to be some demand for liquidity here.\\n\\nBen: Right. Every single one of those family members, most valuable asset and their entire net worth is their privately held Hermes stock that nobody can really put a price tag on. It's just sitting there in everyone's mind of like, it sure would be easier to live my life if I knew that this 90% of my net worth actually worth something that I could access and an even split. That's $25 million a person. I'm pretty sure it's the most valuable thing that any of them owns.\\n\\nDavid: Right. In 1993, Jean-Louis lists Hermes on the Paris Stock Exchange. Collectively, when the dust settles, the family has sold 19% of Hermes to the public. They still own 81%. Now, the public float grows a little bit over the years. As more family members sell, more generational transfer happens. More or less still, 70% plus family owned and controlled. It would really take some sort of absolute financial genius to come in and even consider. We owned over 70% of this business, we're unassailable. Who on earth could possibly make a run at our company?\\n\\nBen: It would take a real wolf, I'll tell you.\\n\\nDavid: This has been so fun. I've had so much fun with this episode. All this history, I just revel in the French connection and everything. This is Hermes' finest moment that we're about to talk about here, through it all.\\n\\nBen: It's interesting, it's not their product.\\n\\nDavid: No. It has nothing to do with the product. The fight with Bernard Arnault.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Before that, now is a great time to share some new news about our longtime friend of the show, Vanta, the leading trust management platform. Vanta, of course, automates your security reviews and compliance efforts. Frameworks like SOC 2, ISO-27001, GDPR, HIPAA compliance, and monitoring, Vanta takes these otherwise time consuming and incredibly resource training efforts for your organization. It makes them fast and simple.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. The big news that they announced last week is they now have over 7000 customers just five years after launch. Vanta is the perfect example of a quote we talk about all the time here on Acquired, Jeff Bezos' idea that a company should only focus on what makes your beer actually taste better, i.e. spend your time and resources only on what's actually going to move the needle for your product and customers and outsource everything else that doesn't. Every company needs compliance and trust with their vendors and customers. It plays a major role in enabling your revenue because customers and partners demand it, but yet it adds zero flavor to your actual beer or your product.\\n\\nBen: Yes, Vanta takes care of all of that for you. No more spreadsheets, fragmented tools, manual reviews to cobble together your security and compliance requirements. It is a one single software pane of glass that connects you to all of your services via APIs and eliminates countless hours of work for your organization. They even launched a bunch of AI capabilities in the last year to make this even simpler and more powerful than before.

It's been 12 months.\\n\\nDavid: It's been too long.\\n\\nBen: I've been wanting to hear the other side of the story.\\n\\nDavid: I know. Okay, for anybody who's listened to our LVMH episode, as we talked about earlier, the climax of the story is Bernard's fight with Gucci in that episode. Gucci is the one that gets away, Bernard isn't able to buy it. Right after the Gucci fight ends in the early 2000s, the same story plays out with Hermes.\\n\\nI think really in an even more dramatic fashion, in 2001, right after he lost Gucci, Bernard quietly buys an initial stake in Hermes of 4.9%. I believe that was just under the threshold that they would have to disclose it under French securities, regulations.\\n\\nHere's what they do that the Hermes families couldn't see coming that only Bernard could engineer. He continues buying for the next 10 years using equity swap derivatives. It looks like other entities are buying these shares on the open markets, but LVMH have the rights to exercise options to actually take those shares. This is really hard to remember. I had to triple check these numbers. At this point in time, Hermes' market cap is below $20 billion.\\n\\nBen: That's 8%-9% of what it is today.\\n\\nDavid: When Bernard first starts buying in the early 2000s, it's below $10 billion. You could say lots of things about Bernard and genius should be top of your list, but he is one of the best investors of all time. To identify Hermes at this point in time, and as we will see, he makes a Incredible amount of money on these trades, today, Hermes is a $230 billion market cap company, and he starts buying at below $10 billion.\\n\\nBen: Which is interesting. You say he spotted Hermes. It wasn't hard to spot. The interesting thing is not that he realized it was the crown jewel of luxury, it was that he realized that the crown jewel of luxury could be worth 20-30 times as much as it was already worth.\\n\\nDavid: He starts buying Hermes shares. Axel, I think, jokes about this in an interview. He's like, look, Bernard isn't buying your shares just because he wants to make an investment or he wants to have some fun. Obviously, he wants to own Hermes.\\n\\nBen: By the way, when David and I are referencing these Axel interviews, it's one interview. He made a random appearance here and there, but he has done one long form, on stage interview, and it is fantastic.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, it's great. We'll link to it in the sources. You should go watch it. Why is Bernard doing this? Obviously, on the one hand, he sees the value here. For God's sakes, that Sex in the City episode was just dedicated to the Birkin. There's a lot of value to be unlocked here, shall we say, in owning Hermes. But it's not just that.\\n\\nI hope on our LVMH episode, this is some of the nuance that we painted about Bernard. He's not just a corporate raider. He actually is an operator. He is one of, if not the best luxury operator out there. He sees two things in Hermes that maybe aren't as obvious to the rest of the world and that he thinks actually are going to create an opportunity for him.\\n\\n(1) Generational transfer is about to happen. Jean-Louis can't live forever. It's not immediately clear who the next successor is going to be. Jean-Louis's son, Pierre-Alexis, takes over as artistic director. Pierre-Alexis went to America for college. He went to Brown University.\\n\\nInteresting. In an interview, I found this. He initially wanted to study computer science at Brown, but he switched to art history, very fitting. He comes in and he joins Hermes right after graduation in 1992. He's being groomed, but Jean-Louis wants to separate out the artistic director role and the CEO role.\\n\\nBen: They had been coupled before?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, he held both. Robert held both. Emile was both, Thierry was certainly both.\\n\\nBen: Right. That really illustrates the point you were making earlier that the creative and the business sides of the house are one side of the house.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Until this generation, it was one person. There was no separation at all. Pierre-Alexis is clearly the artistic heir. There's not a clear CEO heir. In fact, Jean Louis' choice, Axel, who ultimately does become CEO, he's not in the business yet.\\n\\nBen: Right. He did that internship, his five year apprenticeship, but then he left, right?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. The story is that Axel really wanted to go work in China. He goes into investment banking after undergrad. He goes to Sciences Po. Remember, Jean-Louis was his uncle, but his mother who actually was not a family member was the managing director for production for Hermes. Axel has this dinner table trading in addition to the apprenticeship craftsman trading, but he goes off into the investment banking world. He works first in China and then in New York for BNP Paribas.\\n\\nBen: Wow. He is an expert in corporate structure, and he's an expert on this pretty interesting luxury market in the next 20 years China.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, and America too. But he doesn't join the business until 2003 when Jean-Louis taps him. Again, on the one hand, as we've talked about, this is a nepotistic business, on the other hand, they're not going to just give him the CEO title right away. He needs to come pay his dues. He starts in the finance department in 2003. Then in 2006, when Jean Louis retires, Axel takes over running the Jewelry métier as CEO of Jewelry.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, you should know, jewelry is not an important part of the Hermes business. It's one of the 16 métiers. They don't even break it out in earnings. It probably rolls up under other Hermes sectors, because I don't think it's under watches, and I don't think it's under ready to wear accessories. All of other is 12%, so I'm going to guess this thing is 1% to 3%.\\n\\nDavid: He does that for two years. In 2008, he goes and takes over the leather goods and saddlery business, the big one.\\n\\nBen: That's 43% of the business, and I think at the time it was closer to 50%.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Bernard sees, okay, we've got a generational transfer opening here. In fact, when Jean-Louis retires in 2006, he promotes his COO right hand person, Patrick Thomas, to be the first non family member CEO running the business side of the house alongside Pierre-Alexis on the artistic side.\\n\\nBen: At least In retrospect, they try to make this seem like not a big deal that a non family member took over as CEO. They billed it as, well, they needed someone to look after the business in the interim period before the family was ready to have the next heir.\\n\\nDavid: I think there's as much chance as not that that was right, but at a minimum, I think this shows the ignorance. I don't want to say lackadaisicalness of the family here because it's certainly not that, but maybe ignorance or naivete that, hey, you're now a public company, and there are people like Bernard Arnault out there. You can't just be like, oh, yeah, we're going to do public company CEO transition in this way and take our time. You can, but you're opening the door for the Arnaults of the world. That's one thing that Bernard sees.\\n\\nThe other, and I really think this is a testament to his vision, despite all of the strength within Hermes and everything that Jean-Louis did, they actually are showing some cracks. This we had to piece together a little bit and talking to folks in the industry helped us out here. There's no questioning Hermes's financial results and on-the-surface brand value at this point in time in the 2000s, early 2010s, but there are a few things that are just starting to slip as they scale. I think, actually, the best story that illustrates this is one that the family members themselves do not tell but that you'll hear out there in the lore about Hermes, which is that I believe it was in Japan, they had a product, a bag.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. This is so interesting, listeners. If you listen to other coverage of Hermes, you will hear this story.\\n\\nDavid: You never hear it from the perspective that we're about to tell it. Okay, here's how the story goes. Call it the late 2000s, early 2010s. Hermes is selling a canvas beach bag in Japan, and it is flying off the shelves, selling like hotcakes. It's like an equivalent of $150 canvas tote bag beach bag. This obviously gets the attention of management and the company that this is happening.\\n\\nThey decide that they are going in true Hermes fashion. Because it is selling so well, they are going to not only stop selling the product. They're going to take all their supply of it and destroy it. They come into a board meeting with all the family members. The management announced this, and it is met with a standing ovation from the family. This is upholding what Hermes is, which is we don't sell beach bags.\\n\\nBen: The family and the board is so aligned that no one even asked a question about this, they just stood and gave applause. Here's how this went on a meta level listeners. I heard this story, David heard this story. David texted me at one point and was like, isn't this an odd story? I was like, what do you mean? We realized, oh, this is not ever told by any of the family members or company executives anywhere. It's just out there, and the company is not secretive.\\n\\nDavid: They love telling these legendary Hermes stories.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, and they've got a 600-page document they release once every year that clearly lays out their entire strategy. They produce documentaries interviewing their artisans, showing videos of their factories. It rings a little bit odd. It's like, okay, well, why are they not telling this story given how often it's bandied about?\\n\\nDavid: Then you think about it a little bit and you're like, wait a minute, why the F did this happen in the first place?\\n\\nBen: Exactly. A canvas beach bag in Japan?\\n\\nDavid: For $150?\\n\\nBen: And they're making enough of it that it's flying off the shelves? What company is this?\\n\\nDavid: How on earth did this happen? This story here is not a heroic one of we destroyed the supply. This is a tragic one.\\n\\nBen: It's almost like when I was sitting there watching Wonder Woman 84. I was just so appalled at what I was watching that on this meta level, it occurred to me like, the story here isn't the plot of this movie. The story here is, how do you have such a process failure at Warner Brothers where this thing was let out the door? That is a failure of creative leadership, and that is what you have going on with a $150 canvas tote bag after 175 years of successful Hermes brand stewardship.\\n\\nDavid:  Right, and building up the Birkin and the Kelly. For God's sakes, the scarves sell for $500. That I think is the most visceral illustration of this. Two other things that I saw in the research and I think Bernard probably saw here, too. Towards the end of Jean-Louis tenure, he and Hermes started buying and investing in other companies. But why is Hermes doing this?\\n\\nBen: Right. This is the weird stuff going on at Nike when they were buying Converse was the good example, but Starter. It was almost like they didn't realize, oh, we should be concentrating our firepower behind our one hero brand that they were trying to create the constellation of weak brands.\\n\\nDavid: The best Hermes could ever hope for by doing this is they're going to be a subscale. They're not even going to be a Richemont and Kerin.\\n\\nBen: One argument, bootmaker John Lobb and all these other companies that they either bought in whole or in part, it became important for them to own their key supplier relationships.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, those I think were probably strategic acquisitions.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, especially in watches where they actually fairly 25% position in the company that makes the movements to make sure that they have enough supply coming to them. That wasn't all of what they were doing. They were also buying other brands.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Did you find the biggest disaster? This is in your wheelhouse.\\n\\nBen: I don't know.\\n\\nDavid: I was wondering if I could stump you with this. They bought, I believe a 30%-35%. They were the largest shareholder in a German company that makes what is really a piece of technology, an old piece of technology, but not something that should be a luxury brand. This is very much in the performance end of the spectrum. They became the largest shareholders in Leica, the camera company.\\n\\nBen: Really?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. The motivation is like, oh, they're beautiful, they're luxurious cameras, they have leather on the, and we can put Hermes leather on the Leica cameras.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, if they made an Hermes edition Leica camera.\\n\\nDavid: They did.\\n\\nBen: I should probably look into that.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, you're talking about a very narrow target market here. It's a technology product. We'll get into this with Apple in a minute. It didn't go well, let's put it that way. They ended up divesting the stake.\\n\\nBen: It reminds me of when the New York Times did all of this with all the TV stations in the 90s too. It's almost like every company that ever thinks it's a good idea to start buying up other brands is wrong.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, unless that is the core strategy of what you are doing like LVMH.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: The third thing that they do, they incubate and create a new luxury brand and company in China called Shang Xia. I believe I'm pronouncing that right. 2009 is when they launched it. It literally means up down or past-present. The idea is that the Chinese market is so big and so important to Hermes. They're going to lend the Hermes brand to this new brand that is going to have Hermes principles, but take traditional Chinese craftsmanship of which there's a long multi thousand year history.\\n\\nBen: Yup. I actually like the strategy.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. It sounds good on paper, but here's the problem like we were talking about earlier. Nothing compares to French culture as an export and when you are buying luxury. This is a great experiment to run, sure. But the reality is that for probably most countries in the world, when you're talking about spending $20,000 on a piece of leather, you want that to be from Hermes and you want that to be from France. I think this is especially true in China.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, that's such a good point. It's funny. I have a playbook theme called selling a sense of place to those outside it. The numbers behind this are crazy. Today, 76% of their production is in France and 85% is sold outside of France.\\n\\nFirst of all 76% of production in France is incredible the fact that they do this with all these different workshops that are scattered around the country. The incredible French history that is encapsulated by the brand, the French nobility, and the French sense of place, it really is just an intangible connection to the culture that is lusted after everywhere in the world. Why on earth would you throw that away when that really is the essence of your core asset?\\n\\nDavid: Now, easy for us to armchair quarterback here. Obviously, it didn't work. They end up selling it off actually pretty recently to the Agnelli family from Italy, which is the family behind Fiat. Certainly that one, the Leica thing, it's the combination of all these and the beach bag incident. Bernard sees all this.\\n\\nHere's what he says in the press at the time. \\\"I would never diminish the quality of Hermes. Hermes can be an even rarer and greater quality business if they ever wanted to work with us.\\\" I think he's genuine about that. The family obviously circles the wagons and mounts their rebel alliance here, mounting their defense against the empire.\\n\\nBen: Which I think is quite impressive.\\n\\nDavid: Absolutely.\\n\\nBen: The fact that they were able to link arms like this and say in the face of someone trying to make you and all your relatives collectively a multi billionaire in liquid cash, it's incredible to link arms and manage to rebuff it.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. We'll tell the story here, and it's amazing. I think this is like a really important point that I want to land. I don't think Arnaud was wrong. I think he had a point, and I think the company at the time didn't get it. They certainly do now. Okay, what's the story? What happens? Finally, in October of 2010, Arnault is patient.\\n\\nBen: He spent nine years.\\n\\nDavid: Nine plus years that he's just building this stake, being patient. In October, 2010 LVMH exercises its options on the equity swaps that it owns and announces that it had now controls 14.2% of Hermes shares. Bernard at the time says, I had to do it, because other luxury groups were also talking about making a run at Hermes, and I didn't want this crown jewel of France to be owned, heaven forbid, maybe by a non-French organization. A quote here, \\\"I could not sit by and allow a competitor or another investor to take a stake in Hermes.\\\" He's good. He's so good.\\n\\nBen: I love it.\\n\\nDavid: In response to this is the famous or infamous, if you will, quote from Patrick Thomas, the then CEO of Hermes, which we're not going to say the full thing here on air. You can go google it. This is an official press conference with investor relations people. He says, \\\"If you want to seduce a beautiful woman,\\\" Obviously Hermes being the beautiful woman here, \\\"You don't start in the fashion that Bernard is\\\" And he doesn't use those words.\\n\\nThis is hilarious. This is amazing. That makes, of course, a huge splash in the French and international press. The drama here is delicious. Karl Lagerfeld is asked his thoughts on what's going on here. Lagerfeld, of course, is a legend. He's the longtime creative director of Chanel. He comments publicly. \\\"If you don't want to be taken over, don't put your business on the public market.\\\"\\n\\nBen: Game recognize game. That's a great point.\\n\\nDavid: He's got a point.\\n\\nBen: If you want liquidity, this is the trade off you make.\\n\\nDavid: Of course, Lagerfeld, yes, famously is the creative director of Chanel, but he wasn't exclusively the creative director of Chanel, who he is also working for at this point in time. He is also, I believe, the men's wear creative director for Fendi, which is owned by By LVMH.\\n\\nBen: He's on payroll.\\n\\nDavid: He's on payroll. This continues on for months in the public markets and in the press. By December of 2011, the LVMH stake has grown to 22.6%. The family owns 73% of the company at this point, so Bernard now owns almost the entire public float of Hermes.\\n\\nBen: There's 3.5% of Hermes that's publicly floated he doesn't own?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Hermes is in danger of being delisted from the stock exchange.\\n\\nBen: Crazy.\\n\\nDavid: This is what's so brilliant. You might ask, why does this matter? The family owned 73%, Bernard can't do anything. Price is a function of supply and demand. As Bernard is shrinking the float of this company, the shares that are available for trade on the public markets, what happens to the stock price?\\n\\nBen: Skyrocket.\\n\\nDavid: It goes through the roof. Now you've got 80 family members, and they already thought they were really wealthy. They already wanted liquidity. Now, Bernard's coming to them. This is a strategy. Let's just go pick off individual family members one by one, keep increasing his stake, and saying, yeah, I'll pay you the market price, which is now incredibly inflated for this company. Great. Happy to pay you many hundreds of millions of dollars.\\n\\nBen: Crazy.\\n\\nDavid: What happens? This is why I think this really was the family and the company's finest moment. That temptation must have been extreme. That's just the externally identifiable motivations. I'm sure Bernard, other people at LVMH, and everybody else in the industry is doing everything they can to convince family members to sell.\\n\\nBen: Right, and all it takes is one week link or probably a few week links, because the ownership is so divided into tiny chunks by this point. Six generations in, it's pretty peanut buttered around.\\n\\nDavid: I think also just from a psychological perspective, a couple dominoes fall here. As a family member, you start looking around and being like, do I want to be the last one? It's like a crowded theater running for the exits. At the time, you're thinking about like, holy crap.\\n\\nBen: This is the best it's ever going to get.\\n\\nDavid: I may never see another opportunity to get liquid at this price ever. The minute that other family members start selling, supply and demand, the price goes down.\\n\\nBen: Right, I cannot be the last, and it would suck to be the second or the third.\\n\\nDavid: In 2011, the family comes together and over 50 of the 80 family members collectively contribute 50.2% of the equity in the company into a new cooperative vehicle that's called H51, as in 51% of Hermes, as in this vehicle will have majority control of the company. When they contribute their equity into this vehicle, they contractually agree that that equity will be locked up and cannot be sold at least 20 years.\\n\\nThey're basically saying that Bernard, no matter what you do, you could pick off anybody else after this for a minimum of 20 years with potential to extend beyond that. You will never, never, never, you or anybody else have control of Hermes.\\n\\nBen: It's so badass.\\n\\nDavid: It's so badass.\\n\\nBen: Dude, you and I should contribute. We should make A51. Even though it's completely unnecessary, it just feels right for Acquired. I think you and I can each maintain 24.5% stakes, but A51 really should...\\n\\nDavid: I love it. We haven't floated our business on the public markets yet, so we're taking Karl Lagerfeld's advice. We don't need to incur the legal fees around doing this. That vehicle was and is still headed by one of the family members, Julie Guerrand, who was an investment banker at Rothschild. She leaves and full time becomes head of the defense, I assume alongside Axel, who obviously comes from the banking world, too.\\n\\nBen: It's so interesting. I wonder if you actually can structure articles of incorporation to say under no circumstances, can this entity sell what it owns? Normally, what you would do is say, it requires a vote of unanimous from the board of directors, blah, blah, blah, but that leaves you vulnerable to the board of directors getting lobbied and convinced. This is not a public document, so we can't really know, but I wonder how airtight can you really make something and how irreversible?\\n\\nDavid: I don't believe these documents are public. My understanding from comments that family members and Axel make about them, and spoiler alert, recently they've renewed the term of this for another 10 years, so it's into the mid 2040s.\\n\\nBen: They're like, Bernard, you will be dead when this expires. That's exactly what that is.\\n\\nDavid: I believe it's pretty ironclad that these shares cannot be sold.\\n\\nBen: Wow.\\n\\nDavid: In addition to that, two of the Puech brothers, Bertrand and Nicolas, Nicolas is the one that there's the gardener drama about right now.\\n\\nBen: We should say, listeners, in case you don't know, there's a lot of stories floating around in the press right now that Nicolas Puech is going to give half of his stake in Hermes, which represents something like a little under 3% to his gardener or his ex gardener, who's now 51, nobody knows his name.\\n\\nDavid: Nicolas does not have children, heirs, or other heirs.\\n\\nBen: Right. There's a press story right now that just shy of 3% of Hermes could be given to the family gardener.\\n\\nDavid: Anyway, the two Puech brothers do not contribute their shares to H51, but they give H51 a right of first refusal on their shares. They could sell their shares, but at whatever price they agree to, the rest of the family has an offer on purchasing them.\\n\\nBen: Interesting.\\n\\nDavid: That's another, probably 10%-15% of Hermes right there.\\n\\nBen: Whoa. Okay, that's significant. I wonder how this gardener thing is going to play out.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Those shares would be, I believe, subject to that offer, assuming that that has stayed in place. Anyway, this is really just an incredible coordination. Yes, it's a family, they're all family, but there are 80 people here.\\n\\nBen: The fact that they actually rebuffed this offer and that Bernard sold down his stake is crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Let's get into what happens with Bernard's stake, because famously, as Domenico De Sole said in the press at the end of the Gucci affair, even when he loses, he still wins, and Bernard still wins here. This effectively ends the takeover bid when H51 is put in place. Meanwhile, there are all sorts of lawsuits going on, particularly around how LVMH amassed this stake in secret with the equity swaps.\\n\\nBen: It was basically illegal, right?\\n\\nDavid: In 2014, the French court rules that this was illegal. LVMH has to pay a fine, I believe  a $10-$15 million fine for having done this.\\n\\nBen: Pennies.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, right. As we'll see, it's truly pennies. They also mandate that LVMH needs to distribute out that Hermes stake to its own shareholders. LVMH can no longer hold the stake. Who's the largest shareholder in LVMH? It's Group Arnault, which is Bernard Arnault's family office. They get 8% of Hermes personally into his family office entity. This is the brilliance of Bernard. They take that value, which is on the order of $5 billion. Remember, when they started buying, the whole company was trading at a market cap below $10 billion.\\n\\nBen: Massively appreciated stock. They basically created value out of nowhere here. This billions of dollars landing in Bernard's personal bank account, he has created that money out of nowhere.\\n\\nDavid: He has unlocked shareholder value for sure, even in the absence of a change of control transaction. Back when Bernard was engineering his takeover of LVMH, one of the financial instruments that he used to do it was he IPO'd a 25% stake in Dior. He already owned Dior that he had gotten out of bankruptcy from Boussac.\\n\\nBen: That's right. He had this Russian doll structure, where he owned a slim majority of an entity that owned a slim majority of an entity, that owned a slim majority. He was able to generate a bunch of liquid cash from all the minority shares that he sold off, but he still got to control Dior, LVMH, Group Arnault, because he was technically the majority owner of each of them.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, but he and LVMH didn't own this 25% minority stake in Dior. He takes the Hermes shares and does a share swap. Swaps that value directly with the 25% of Dior that he doesn't own to bring that first into Group Arnault, his family office, and then he trades that into LVMH. LVMH now, finally, as a result of this, is able to take 100% control of Dior.\\n\\nIn exchange for group are no trading this asset into Dior, Bernard's ownership of LVMH goes from 36% up to 46%. He gets an extra 10 percent of LVMH. Here's the most incredible aspect of this. Not a single dollar in tax is paid on all of this because it's all share swaps. Basically, Bernard just gets 10% more of his own company as a result of this.\\n\\nBen: Which would then go on to appreciate.\\n\\nDavid: 400%-500% over the next five to six years.\\n\\nBen: 5x'd since 2017?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah.\\n\\nBen: Wow. Even when he loses, he wins.\\n\\nDavid: Unbelievable. This is a situation where everybody wins. I don't think there are any losers here. The Hermes families absolutely are not losers. You could even say they have the last laugh here. Yes, Bernard gets to benefit from an extra 4x-5x appreciation in LVMH's market cap here. From the real beginning of when LVMH publicly announces their stake in Hermes, 2010, Hermes' market cap is up 16x.\\n\\nBen: It's crazy. The reason why no one's a loser here and everyone's a winner is because Hermes truly is the crown jewel. It is such an unassailable, exceptional business. The last 12 months, it did $14 billion in revenue, $5.7 billion in operating income. They have a 71% gross margin and a 44% operating margin. It's a software business that doesn't need any R&D.\\n\\nDavid: Tech companies go like, I don't know what Hermes color to call it, but some color with envy over this. There is one more chapter of the story that we have to tell, because that wouldn't have just happened. It wasn't just the Bernard affair in and of itself that led to this 16x market cap increase. He was right, like I was saying earlier. There were, I think, some real problems in the business. That is the story of the sixth generation of Pierre-Alexis and Axel, who I think have certainly fixed those problems, but have really led Hermes, the business, and the company into a whole new era.\\n\\nBen: Yes, that is absolutely right. There is a quote that I want to start with for the Axel Dumas era, which is possibly the best articulation that I've ever heard of business strategy anywhere. He did it in the interview that we were talking about. He says, \\\"Every decision that we make has got some reverse effect.\\\" Which I think is like a French translation for trade off.\\n\\n\\\"Every decision we make has got some trade off. There's something I really like about strategy in Michael Porter. Strategy is accepting that you are doing something better than the other, and the other is doing something better than you. You have to pick your fight. I'm always a little bit disappointed when I see someone on my team say that we do everything at the same time. Great. That doesn't happen in real life. You have to pick your fight, and Hermes picks their fights better than anyone/\\\"\\n\\nDavid: What they've done over the last 10 years since the Bernard fight is that they have figured out how to scale handcrafted artisanal production.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: On the surface, those are completely oxymoronic terms. Those are completely diametrically opposed.\\n\\nBen: This is a dead art in the world, and Hermes manages to crank out hundreds of thousands of products that otherwise would only be created by individual makers with no infrastructure, no brand, it'd be really hard to discover them, and frankly, they would all just go out of business. Most of them go out of business anyway.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. What was the stat that you said a little while ago that there are 120,000 Birkins and Kellys produced every year?\\n\\nBen: Yup, exactly.\\n\\nDavid: If they were still making these things on the third floor at the Faubourg, no way. This was the problem and what the consultants were saying at the start of Jean-Louis' tenure of like, hey, you need to outsource production, you need to scale production, you need to make this more accessible.\\n\\nBen: Right, you have a global brand now. You need to figure out how to serve the demand for your brand.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. The Patrick Thomas quote that I want to start with is so great. \\\"The luxury industry is built on a paradox. The more desirable a brand becomes, the more it sells. But the more it sells, the less desirable it becomes.\\\" We've been talking about this whole episode, but then he continues. \\\"I believe Hermes' vision provides a solution to this dilemma.\\\" This is what the current generation has found, the solution.\\n\\nToday. I think we referenced this earlier in the episode, Hermes employs 7000 master craftspeople, artisans. Most of the story that we've been telling thus far, until 1992, all of the craftspeople in the company, more or less, were working in the Faubourg in this one relatively small building on the Rue Faubourg du Saint-Honoré in Paris.\\n\\nIn 1992, they moved production to Pantin in the suburbs of Paris. That building is amazing, but only houses about 250-300 craftspeople. Actually, still to this day, Axel talks about this a lot, any one of their production sites does not have more than 250-300 craftspeople.\\n\\nBen: Yes. They believe that every single person should know each other by name. They think that 250-300 is the natural limit on that. Axel even says, if you have more than 300, it is not a workshop, it's a factory.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, and they are not in the business of factories. At the same time, he and the company have stated as an explicit goal that they will ramp up production capacity by 7% every year. As the company gets larger and larger, today that means adding 500 artisans every year.\\n\\nBen: Crazy. When Axel started at the company all the way back in the 80s, there were 250 craftsmen, period. They hired two craftsmen per year in the late 80s.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Here's the issue though. How on earth are you going to do this? Like you were saying, this is a dead art. Nobody else does this.\\n\\nBen: Little maker with a workshop in San Francisco or a workshop in Paris, but how are you even going to find them?\\n\\nDavid: Right. Those people, the Beatrices here in San Francisco, they're entrepreneurs. They're not going to go back to joining Hermes, because they all came from Hermes in the first place. How are you going to hire 500 a year? It's not like they can go higher from their competitors. They're not doing this.\\n\\nBen: Right. Their competitors have all outsourced production and embraced assembly lines.\\n\\nDavid: They do the only thing that you can do. They build the pipeline of training master craftspeople and artisans entirely themselves. They build schools, they build training centers. They go to parts of France that are in rural areas, that have high unemployment.\\n\\nThey go to those areas, they open trade schools, and they say, we're going to train you. They have 100% graduation rates. They're like, we're not going to give up on you, we're going to make sure you learn this trade that you graduate. You may not come work for Hermes when you graduate, but we're going to give you this skill. Then we're going to offer you a job as a master craftsman.\\n\\nBen: It's crazy.\\n\\nDavid: It's unbelievable. Even through the Jean-Louis era, the fifth generation, Beatrice was the anomaly as a woman. These were all old men that were doing this stuff. Today, the average age of the Hermes artisan workforce is 30 years old and 80% are women.\\n\\nBen: It's wild.\\n\\nDavid: It's a wholesale transformation. They are training them. They actually just opened in 2021, their first official French governmentally sanctioned degree granting program, the École Hermès de Savoie Ferre. This is the savoir faire that pops up in the annual report a hundred whatever times.\\n\\nBen: Let's name a school after it too.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. They're getting into government policy here. They are preserving and growing this art form in France.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, they're not France's largest export, because they have a very constrained way that they can create the products, but they may be France's finest export. It behooves the French government to try to figure out how to make this last another hundred years.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Today, there are 31 Hermès ateliers, artisan manufacturing facilities all throughout the country, each with no more than 250-300 people in it.\\n\\nBen: Right. It's the cloud computing idea of scaling horizontally.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. This is AWS. This is the point I'm getting to.\\n\\nBen: Right. They're building data centers.\\n\\nDavid: They were Amazon and they added AWS. They are adding two to four of those every year.\\n\\nBen: It's so funny, you had that thought too. It's all people. It's all sticking to the thing that got them here, which is every product or at least every leather goods product, every handbag made end to end by one artisan trained in the traditional early 20th century way.\\n\\nDavid: Speaking of cloud computing, we want to share a fun thing that our friends at NVIDIA have given us. For anyone considering attending GTC this year, Acquired listeners get a 20% discount. This is their big annual conference that Ben and I have watched over a dozen keynotes from to prep for our NVIDIA series.\\n\\nBen: Yup. It'll be March 18th-21st, 2024 at the San Jose Convention Center. It is the first time back in person in five years, which is crazy. It's the most important AI conference in the world. Jensen will be speaking to 10,000 people live in person.\\n\\nDavid: Wow. There are also researchers speaking from OpenAI, Meta, Google, DeepMind, Microsoft, Forge, Genentech, Disney, National Labs, and more. It's crazy. They will have a whole bunch of futuristic vehicles, robots on display.\\n\\nBen: Yup. If you want to check it out, click the link in the show notes and enter the code ACQUIRED at checkout  to give you 20%. Thanks to our friends at NVIDIA. Now, back to Hermes.\\n\\nDavid: This is an insane idea that leather goods, which is 43% of the business, Hermes did €11.6 billion in revenue last year. They're on track to probably do €14 billion.\\n\\nBen: Yup. The last 12 months is €14 billion.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. That €6 billion of that is going to be handcrafted items, where one artisan makes one item at a time, and they're sold around the world. €6 billion worth of that every year growing at 15%-20% a year? Yeah, wild.\\n\\nBen: This is a really important thing to understand about the company. (1) They firmly believe that only 250-300 craftsmen can work in a building. (2) It takes two-plus years for someone to learn the craft and apprentice. (3) Every one of these things must be created by one individual by hand. If you believe all those three things for sure, then it forces a very specific constraint on your business, and you must work backward from that.\\n\\nYou can only train so fast. You can only produce so fast, which then of course means that it affects your products, it affects the availability, and it affects the price, which of course means that it affects the customer set. There's a way to view Hermes, which is they want the very highest end customer with zero price sensitivity. They do whatever they need to serve that master.\\n\\nI think there's another very real way to look at it, which is how the company describes themselves that starts with the constraints of the craft. When you hold true to that ethos at its most extreme, you end up with the company's brand and posture that you have today as the only logical end point. They can only hire 300, 400, or 500 craftsmen a year. They can only do this other stuff. Good luck getting a Birkin bag. It's just one of these things where you can say they're artificially constraining supply all you want.\\n\\nDavid: As long as they do things this way, this is the max throughput.\\n\\nBen: They would have to change something. They would have to say, hey, There's some new fancy saddle stitching machine that it turns out makes us just as high a quality product, and every craftsman is twice as effective or something like that. But until they fold on one of these constraints that they've decided are stakes in the ground, the result is the scarcity. That's not the goal, that's the result.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. The Amazon comparison is so apt here. Hermes has this incredible unassailable flywheel, but it operates in the exact opposite way of an Amazon flywheel. It's not about maximizing the cycles, it's slowing. It's minimizing. It's an intentionally rate limited flywheel, and it all works together.\\n\\nBen: At the end of the day, it is probably true that neither one is the starting place, and neither one is the ending place. The two things that I'm referring to here are the method of craftsmanship and the price and scarcity. They just work harmoniously together. One is not driving the other. It is that they both want the brand posture that they have, and they want the constraints that they have, so it works together perfectly.\\n\\nA cynical person could be like, well, yeah, all that handcrafted mumbo jumbo only exists, because that's how you justify the brand pricing and availability that they've put in place. But I think it all works in concert.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. We've told the whole episode. I'm thinking back to what Beatrice told me when I asked her why. If a master craftsperson made this thing by hand, it has a soul. If a machine made it in an assembly line, it does not.\\n\\nBen: Right. Maybe, but sure. In an assembly line with crappy ingredients, blah, blah, blah, sure, but can craftsmen use better tools? Yes. Will Hermes continue to embrace tools that make craftsmen more efficient? At some point, did they use sharper knives than were previously available in the past? They totally did. Will they use things that make the needle go a little faster? Maybe.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Let's take a step back here. We got to consider the exact opposite case study of this, which is a hundred percent happening to great success, which in a lot of ways is the same thing that the consultants told Jean-Louis back in the day, look at the rest of the industry. Louis Vuitton, which as we talked about, has the same caliber of heritage and history as Hermes.\\n\\nBen: Yes. It could have Hermes's gravity if it wanted to, but instead you can buy a checkerboard cotton sweatshirt with 120 LVs on it.\\n\\nDavid: Right. They are having the same level of success, the same margins. It's working like a charm.\\n\\nBen: But it's less durable.\\n\\nDavid: I think that's the question. Is it less durable, or is it just that these are different strategies? Here's the crux of it that we've also been teasing on the episode that I think now's the time to come back to, this thing that I'm wearing on my wrist, the Apple Watch partnership.\\n\\nBen: Out of left field, very surprising, very odd for the brand to do this.\\n\\nDavid: I have a lot of complicated feelings about the thing on my wrist, including primarily that I love it. Okay, here's the story. In 2015, Apple launches the Apple Watch. Supposedly, the story goes that Jony Ive, and the watch I think was really Jony's pet project as his last hurrah before leaving Apple, he had all these quotes at the time of the Swiss watch industry, better watch out, we're coming for them, et cetera.\\n\\nBen: Which was true. Different market, but it's by far the best selling watch in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, but as far from been the death knell of the Swiss watch industry.\\n\\nBen: Right, yeah. The Swiss watch industry has done just fine since the Apple watch came out on the high end.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Marc Newson was consulting for Apple specifically on the watch, and Jony asked Marc to introduce him to Pierre-Alexis, Axel, and to Hermes. Apple was looking for a luxury fashion brand. Remember, there is the Apple watch edition in the beginning that was like the gold Apple watch and all that.\\n\\nBen: Man, $10,000 for something that was going to be obsolete in a year. It's crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. That clearly didn't work.\\n\\nBen: But it's beautiful.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, totally beautiful, but they needed a luxury brand. They needed a brand that was not deeply in bed with the traditional Swiss watch industry, which some of these luxury groups are.\\n\\nBen: It's funny. I hadn't actually made that connection that that's why it's Hermes and not...\\n\\nDavid: I think there are two reasons. That's one reason. The other reason is they needed a brand that was going to appeal to pretty much everybody. For everything we've talked about with Louis Vuitton and how successful that's been, it's polarizing.\\n\\nBen: Totally. Apple also needed to go to the very top of whatever they were going to grab. The thing about Hermes is whatever they make...\\n\\nDavid: Nobody is ever going to say that Hermes makes crap.\\n\\nBen: Right. They make the most fully realized version of whatever they're making. If they have an idea, they want to release the best possible, most extreme, exquisite version of that thing. That's very Apple. Apple has to make compromises for the scale that they're at. But if Apple had partnered with someone that was more opinionated, let's say they were better in some ways but worse than others, it doesn't play for Apple's brand. They need to partner with someone unassailable.\\n\\nDavid: Axel and Pierre Alexi talk about this all the time when they're asked about, oh, XYZ flashy celebrity is carrying a Birkin bag, blah, blah, blah, they say, look, we don't judge. We never judge here at Hermes. Our clients are our clients, whether it's Grace Kelly or Kim Kardashian. That's what Apple needed.\\n\\nAxel has a great quote on this. He says, \\\"We had an incredible talk with Jonathan Ive, and there was a lot of mutual admiration and common values. From that, we said, wouldn't it be nice to have something combining our craftsmanship, our vision? It was about trying to make a contemporary, elegant object. It was not a master plan of global domination.\\\"\\n\\nOkay. This thing on my wrist is exactly what Axel is saying there. It is a contemporary, elegant object that is beautiful leather. The reason I bought it is for my life and modern life, this thing is on my wrist 23 hours a day. I sleep with it.\\n\\nBen: A hundred percent. I love the Hermes slim to Hermes watch. I looked at that thing five times during research lusting after it and ultimately closed the browser tab being like, I wear an Apple watch all day every day. There's just no world where it actually makes sense for me to own a different watch.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Even more than my phone, this thing is part of me. When I was looking to do research for this episode and buy a bit of the Hermes dream, I couldn't imagine anything more appropriate be closer to me than literally it's on my wrist 23 hours a day. At the same time, I find it absolutely terrifying from the perspective of what it means for Hermes and the Hermes' future, not because I think that Apple and technology is going to take over the world, but I think there are some serious problems with this product along the lines of the issues that Bernard identified in the company when he was making his run.\\n\\nLet's start with the price. I bought the deployment buckle version of the strap, because I thought it looked amazing. It is the most expensive version of the band that Hermes sells as such, and it costs $540.\\n\\nBen: Which is expensive for an Apple watch band, but it's in the ballpark of Apple accessories, or it's at least maybe twice as much as normal Apple accessories.\\n\\nDavid: This is among the cheapest leather products that Hermes sells. As a comparison, if you want to go buy an Hermes luggage tag, $640. Let's move out of leather goods for a second. If you want to go buy an Hermes sweatshirt, over $2000. If you want to buy an Hermes piece of furniture, and they make incredibly beautiful furniture, $40,000 minimum. $540 for this thing, it's not priced right for an Hermes product. It's too low.\\n\\nBen: It's somehow bridging the gap between an Apple product and an Hermes product.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and maybe that's because it's also sold in Apple stores, et cetera. But related to that, you start to think about that, wait, why is the price so low? On the exquisite orange packaging and box that this thing came in, nowhere on it nor on the product page on the website does it say that it was handmade.\\n\\nBen: So Hermes' belts, I believe they're Apple watches, and there are other things, are machine zone?\\n\\nDavid: This to me is like, wow. Would I have spent $2000 on a handmade Apple Watch Hermes band? Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. Whether I would have is irrelevant. Hermes should be selling $2000 handmade Apple Watch bands.\\n\\nBen: Even if people aren't buying them, that's the question. I agree with you, because what I think this does is it defies how I think of Hermes, which is whatever they're going to do, they're going to do it at the logical extreme. They're not going to compromise. They're not going to figure out how to address a lower market. They're going to sell the same expensive scarf that they sold their grandma to you, but they're going to have a different way to advertise it. This is weird.\\n\\nDavid: It's weird.\\n\\nBen: It's a compromise. I think the same thing about their belts, by the way. I think the same thing about anything that is machine sewn so it can be mass produced and have availability in every store. It feels like they don't promise that everything they make is hand sewn, but it feels like a mild violation of the brand promise.\\n\\nDavid: Right, yeah. I don't know. On the one hand, I love it. I don't want any other Apple watch strap. It is an Hermes product. It's beautiful. On the other hand, yeah, it feels like a profanity.\\n\\nBen: You're right, it does feel like a profanity. Apple is the you know most valuable brand in the world, but the most common brand in the world. For Hermes to associate with such a common brand feels odd. Apple is the definition of mass market at this point.\\n\\nDavid: I think that is certainly part of it The thing that is really just head scratching to me about it is, why did they not sell these things for four times as much and make them by hand? What are they getting out of selling a machine made strap for $540?\\n\\nBen: Maybe you're now an Hermes customer and over the next 50 years, you're on a journey with them.\\n\\nDavid: I think that's true. I mean, I'm going back tomorrow.\\n\\nBen: What are you getting tomorrow?\\n\\nDavid: I don't want to spoil Jenny's birthday/Valentine surprise. I'm actually getting two things, but we'll talk about this on a future episode.\\n\\nBen: Okay. Sounds good. Cliffhanger.\\n\\nDavid: Cliffhanger. Just to put some numbers and finish out the story, by 2018, revenue has grown from €3.5-€4 billion when Axel took over in 2013. By 2018, that's €6 billion. In 2019, it's €7 billion. It dips a bit during 2020 with the pandemic, but then €9 billion in 2021. Last year, €11. 6. Like we said, on track for €14 billion in 2023. This is an absolutely resounding success.\\n\\nAs we've said, what Axel, Pierre-Alexis, and this generation of the family has done like all the generations before them has been nothing short of amazing, starting with the defense against Bernard. Incredible. I don't want to fully judge or leave a negative mark on the company solely because of the Apple watch thing, but I just got to say, we've seen with a few times here in these generations that the seeds of the next challenge are sown in the current generation. I wonder if this is it here.\\n\\nBen: Hermes has always thrived by figuring out how to be above it all and it be counterposition to the rest of luxury. It's an open question, I think, of whether the Apple partnership helps that or hurts that. Okay, a few more stats on the business today before we move into analysis. Does that sound good to you, David?\\n\\nDavid: Great.\\n\\nBen: I thought one fascinating thing was Axel saying that with the 4. 3 billion in net income that they do, they always split it roughly the same way. One third to the dividend, one third gets reinvested in capex, and one third in cash. What's pretty interesting is, they have a reasonably low reinvestment rate. They're dividending out a lot of cash, and they're holding onto a lot of cash. Two thirds of it.\\n\\nWhat's obvious there in the numbers that we've talked about in a more subjective way is they have a limited ability to actually reinvest in the business. It's much like Costco. They're constrained by factors other than capital. You give them more money, they can't do anything with it, which I just find fascinating. They can only train the craftspeople so fast.\\n\\nFrankly at some point, they'll saturate the market too. If they're going to address the whole world, they're going to have to change what they sell, and the Apple Watch may be the first little version of that. They grew 20%-25% last year. They can't keep growing at 25% without changing what Hermes stands for. Even if they could train these craftspeople as fast as possible, they have another governor, which is scarcity, product image, price. At some point, they'll bump up against the walls of that, and no additional craftspeople and no additional money can help them grow anymore.\\n\\nDavid: That's such a good point. That's the counterpoint to my impassioned concern a minute ago. Okay, great, David, everything you were just saying, that translates to Hermes is a museum, and Hermes is not a museum. It has to meet its clients where they are. Like I said, I wear this thing 23 hours a day. I couldn't imagine buying any other product from them.\\n\\nBen: I'm sure there are some members of the family that want to walk around with their nose in the air, be a museum, and say, Hermes is pure, and I want to go my whole life and then die with Hermes remaining pure. There are other members of the family that are like, can we serve customers and grow this business? My God. That Apple Watch represents the second faction.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, totally.\\n\\nBen: Next, their cash position. They've got $10 billion in cash, and that is after materially increasing the dividend for the first time in a decade. They've recently just started dividending out more cash, which again is emblematic of the same idea of money is not our constraint, which is pretty new for the business. That's a decade or two old problem that never existed over the first 170 years.\\n\\nAn interesting thing to know about a business is it was always run under the constraint of even if we see growth opportunities, we don't have enough cash to pursue all of them. Now they actually do. It's interesting to see how management responds in this opportunity for abundance that they have and figures out how to treat certain elements of the business as a scarce resource, even though they don't have to.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Now, certainly there is an element too to the dividend that is part of making the family shareholding lock up an easier pill to swallow.\\n\\nBen: Yes, quite palatable. The segments of the business, leather goods and salary is 43%. That's the big guy. We didn't talk about this much on the episode, but ready to wear and accessories is 27%. That's a big chunk.\\n\\nThe second largest chunk of the business is clothing, effectively. I have an open question of whether they should be in clothing. Isn't it antithetical? Certainly, it's odd to see them in the fashion world, and they do these runway shows, and they do couture, but it feels weird. It somehow feels antithetical in some way.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. They're not a fashion brand, and yet they participate in it.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Next largest segment after that is silk and textiles. It's so remarkable how small the scarf business has become of their overall mix given that it used to be close to half the business. After that is perfume and beauty at 4%, watches at 4%, and then there's a couple categories of others, which I think it's really interesting to look at perfume and beauty as another glimpse of what's to come. They make a hundred dollar bottles of perfume, and they sell them at department stores.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, and they launched beauty in 2020 with lipstick.\\n\\nBen: Yup, which I think is very China focused. It's very interesting to me that they are trying to appeal, especially to a younger demographic, with a lot of their recent perfumes and selling in department stores. Again, it feels antithetical to Hermes as this pure brand. But on the other hand, it's a continuation of the Apple Watch strategy even further.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. There's one more elephant in the room to me that we haven't addressed via the story, which is that the business is a global business for sure, but really today, this business is an Asia business.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Here are some stats. In 2006, France was already down to 19% of sales. It started at 100% of sales, so that's why I say down to 19% in 2006. This is a while ago or almost 20 years ago. At that point in time, Japan represented 27% of sales. There's all this talk about China and luxury today, Japan was that in the early 2000s. Crazy, right? Japan was one and a half times France in terms of sales for Hermes.\\n\\nToday, France is down to just 9% of sales. Let's flash back to 2006 again. We talked about Japan being at 27% of sales. Asia Pacific, outside of Japan, was only 17%. Japan was almost one and a half times as large as rest of Asia. Today, rest of Asia is 48%. Half of Hermes' business is Asia excluding Japan.\\n\\nDavid: AKA China.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. That's crazy. I think Russia accounted for a decent amount of that.\\n\\nDavid: Interesting. The Japan story, actually, I think is still significant. Japan today is 10% of revenue?\\n\\nBen: Yeah, Japan's larger than France. It's 9% in France, 10% in Japan.\\n\\nDavid: Right. I actually looked into that and was like, huh. The rest of Asia, again, AKA China is 48% of the business. But on a per capita basis, Japan buys twice as much Hermes as China.\\n\\nBen: That's interesting.\\n\\nDavid: Still, Japan is, I believe, around a 10th of the size of China and is 10% of Hermes sales versus 48% for rest of Asia. For a small country, like France, it's still very, very significant for the business.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. I will say that you listen to management commentary. Hermes is very excited about China's middle class, and they have done a really good job SKUing younger there. Eighty percent of clients in China are below 40.\\n\\nDavid: Wow. Again, this is a huge, unique success for Hermes. China has been big for the whole luxury industry over the last decade plus, but the past few years, particularly the last two years, China has been real tough for the luxury industry, and yet Hermes is still growing there.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Employee count, they have 21,000 total employees, 7000 are artisans, 62% of employees work in France. They really have stayed French, they've not outsourced. They have 54 production sites in France or what they call workshops, and they manufacture 76% of the objects that they sell in their stores in their own exclusive workshops. They do still have these partnerships with other companies that they own part of, just have a partnership with, or a distribution deal with. Usually what it means is it's sold as an Hermes product, but it's made by another manufacturer.\\n\\nOver the years, they've done this with shoes, umbrellas, leather jackets, raincoats, silverware, and glove. They've had all these independent craftsmen that they contracted with who have these really small shops, really small operations, and don't have the brand reach that Hermes does, but they make Hermes products that are actually made by those people. So it's interesting. I think they are decreasing that when I give the number that at this point, 76% of objects are made in its own exclusive workshops, but it is more correct than not to think about Hermes as they control everything from design to production, to brand, to retail today.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. I think a lot of those, there's a silversmith and a tableware manufacturer that they own large stakes into, so it's like a related party.\\n\\nBen: Yup,  exactly They have over 300 stores in 45 countries. David, as I mentioned earlier, in 2020, the Wall Street Journal estimated that about 120,000 Birkin and Kelly bags were made in that year. That's about 25%-30% of total revenue coming from just those two bags, which again, you can't buy, and also, you can't even see.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, they're not on display in the stores.\\n\\nBen: I went to a few Hermes stores over the last year, (1) because I love the brand, (2) because I was thinking we might do this episode at some point. I saw zero Birkin or Kelly bags even on display. This is the thing that they generate all their buzz about and make 30% of their revenue from, and you can't see it in a store. Crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Totally crazy.\\n\\nBen: If you just do some napkin math at 25 hours per bag, that's 1500 craftsmen just making Birkins and Kellys all day long.\\n\\nDavid: Sounds about right.\\n\\nBen: They have 16 métiers, and one in particular that I want to talk about is Petit H. This is one of my favorite Hermes things, period. It started in 2010. It's a very interesting idea. For other leather brands, you typically see them trying to use the second best leather cut in some of their bags, but at Hermes they'll never do that. There's no bag that's ever produced with any imperfections or any part of the leather that they think is any lesser than the best.\\n\\nWhat do they do with all that leftover material? For years, they were just storing it. This is everything from the leathers to the felts, to the silks. All this extra material where they were just like, there's a tiny little bit that's usable, but not enough to actually make another bag to our standards, so into the closet it goes.\\n\\nIn 2010, they launched Petit H. What they basically do is they collaborate with other artists for tiny little goods that can be cut from the scraps, that are super whimsical, super fun. Think luggage tags that are cute little animals. It's just enough of a shape to know that it's a bull, a bear, or a cat. You look at it and you're like, oh, that's really clever What they call it is creation in reverse, you start designing with the materials, not the end product in mind.\\n\\nIt's the opposite of everything else that Hermes has ever done, which is think about what's the perfect good we can create to solve this problem for a customer. This was like, no, we've got a bunch of scraps, what's fun stuff we can do? That is that whimsy coming through.\\n\\nDavid: Yes.\\n\\nBen: One thing that I want to say about the luxury bubble cooling is that earlier, I chalked it up to, well, Hermes has the most exclusive brand posture, so they have the least price sensitive customers, so they're going to feel the pullback less than everyone else. That is true, but there are other parts of it too.\\n\\nHermes' obsession with responsible growth, limiting production, and slower price appreciation also plays into the desirability and the durability of their goods. If they were out there cranking the prices of Birkin bags, you might think less of them. If they were out there trying to produce more of them to meet demand, you'd certainly think less of them, if they were outsourcing production anyway. It's how they conduct business that has caused them to be in a better position than the rest of the luxury industry right now in this pullback.\\n\\nDavid: I'm glad you reminded me to bring this up. When we were talking earlier about the question of the secondary market and why are they leaving pricing power on the table.\\n\\nBen: Essentially, there's consumer surplus in economic terms.\\n\\nDavid: Right. I said, I think they increased prices across the product range by about 7% per year. Where I got that from is if you look at the compounded annual revenue growth rate of Hermes for the last 10 years, the sixth generation era, it's 15%. Revenue has grown 15% compounded annually since Axel took over in 2013. They've increased production 7% per year. That's their stated goal.\\n\\nIf you say, okay, of the 15% revenue growth, take out the 7% production growth, that leaves 7%-8%. That's got to be attributable to price increases, which I think this is the answer. Is it the right strategy? Probably it is the right strategy if you're thinking about, hey, this is a generational business, we're on the 6th generation. We want to ensure it's around for the 12th generation. Yes, we're leaving consumer surplus on the table here, because we don't want to be seen as that brand that is $100,000 handbags, even though they are $100,000 handbags.\\n\\nBen: Right. Yeah, there's a fine line.\\n\\nDavid: There's a gaucheness to it.\\n\\nBen: Right, exactly. They need to have a price that's high enough to signal this is something really, really special. We are more unique than every other luxury brand who's trying to make similar products and have similar positioning, but also it's not so expensive that it's gauche. I think the latter part, it's not actually about the dollar amount. It's about the price difference, because if it's three times as much as it was a decade ago, it's harder to trust the intrinsic value of the good if it's fluctuating all over the place.\\n\\nDavid: There probably is an element of defense that they can fall back upon of, well, yes, we sell these things for $12,000, $20,000, whatever. But the moment you take possession, you can turn around and sell it for more.\\n\\nBen: This is an intentional strategy over a Rolex. They increase prices a certain amount per year, and they want to show a track record of that so that if you buy one, you can rest assured that it's going to increase in value over time and that it's a good investment, because counterintuitively, by increasing the price more than the rate of inflation every year, or especially more than the rate of 5%-7% stock market return, it spurs people to buy that otherwise wouldn't have bought because they feel more safe making the purchase.\\n\\nDavid: This concept landed for me during our Porsche episode, working with Doug DeMuro. There's a class of. Almost every car that you would ever buy. The old adage is true that the day you drive it off the lot, it's worth 20% less than it was the day when you bought it. For luxury cars, collectors, cars, rare cars, et cetera, the opposite is true. These are investment vehicles. If you buy a Carrera GT, you're going to spend a million dollars for it, but you can also be confident that you're not going to lose money on that purchase. It's an investment.\\n\\nBen: Right. There's a business unit that we didn't talk about yet called Hermes Horizons.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, which is not an official métier, right?\\n\\nBen: It is not a métier. They break it out under other products. They have four categories of other products. There's Internet of Things, which is Apple Watch. There's tanneries and precious leathers. There's metal parts, which is a J3L subsidiary that I think literally makes the clasps and stuff like that.\\n\\nDavid: My deployment buckle.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and then there's Hermes Horizons.\\n\\nDavid: This is so great.\\n\\nBen: Hermes Horizons is perfectly named. What it basically says is...\\n\\nDavid: If you have a private jet and you want it outfitted with Hermes seats, we've got the division for you.\\n\\nBen: We will make you seats.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. There's an amazing quote from an article, probably 10, 15 years old. The person who is running this division said something like, \\\"We get a lot of clients who come in here, and they want a big H on whatever it is they want us to make. We have to have a discussion with those clients that if that's what you want, we are not the place for you.\\\" It's so great. Maybe one day be Hermes Horizons customers.\\n\\nBen: Maybe, we'll see.\\n\\nDavid: All right. Let's transition officially to analysis and start with power as we always do. Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, this is the question of what enables a given business to achieve persistent differential returns or to be more profitable than their closest competitor on a sustainable basis. The seven that Hamilton has identified are counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs, network economies, process power, branding, and cornered resource.\\n\\nThe question we asked, David, on the LVMH episode was for luxury brands, is there anything else other than branding power? The definition of branding power is if I present you two identical objects, and one of them is branded and one of them is unbranded, it is literally quantified as the premium that you are willing to pay me for the brand. In Hermes' case, it may not actually be branded, but you might still know it as Hermes and be willing to pay more for it.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. If you know, you know.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Again, we're drawing a lot of attention to quiet luxury here. Hermes is not as quiet luxury as they once were. I think it's safe to say it would have an H, a horse, woven H into the fabric, or something like that if presented to you here. But obviously, there's a tremendous amount of branding power.\\n\\nDavid: On the LVMH episode, we talked a lot about, and I think this truly was maybe the most brilliant thing that Bernard Arnault did. He realized when nobody else did that there were scale economies in luxury to a group of luxury brands. There's the opposite of scale economies to an individual luxury brand, but at the group level, there is power and specifically scale economies power that does not exist the brand level. Clearly, none of that is happening here.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Okay. I have two cases to make for non-brand powers that come into play.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, great.\\n\\nBen: Cornered resource.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, I agree. They literally have all the craftsmen.\\n\\nDavid: Agree.\\n\\nBen: Except for the ones that are opening their own independent shop, and those ones don't have brand power. An Hermes craftsman can make a wallet, an independent craftsman can make a wallet, you're going to pay a lot more for the Hermes one. In fact, you're never even going to be aware that the independent craftsman exists. If someone else wanted to go compete with Hermes, it'd be hard because they don't have the brand, they don't have the history, but also, you literally can't find any more craftsmen, so you'd have to train them yourselves.\\n\\nDavid: I think even the other luxury brands out there, most of them probably do have some craftsmen, some stuff that's done by hand, some components of some products done by hand. But nobody does what Hermes does, and Hermes does all the craftsmen, so cornered resource for sure.\\n\\nBen: Yup. The other one that is a little bit squishier, are they counter positioned to other luxury brands by basically saying, hey, we don't have to serve as many customers as you, so we actually can handcraft each item individually? Louis Vuitton has no ability to switch gears and say, ooh, it's important to compete on the vector of handcrafted.\\n\\nDavid:  Right, there are a lot of t shirts out there.\\n\\nBen: Right. They have to serve too many customers, but Hermès doesn't. It's flimsy counter positioning.\\n\\nDavid: No. I like that, actually. It's rare to have counter positioning at scale. As Hamilton would put it, counter positioning is usually a takeoff phase power. I think there's an element of that. You could dissect how much of that particular element is actually part of the Hermes brand versus counter positioning in and of itself, but I buy it. I think at the end of the day, though, we spent however long this episode will be when it ships, recounting the myth of the brand here like brand is the power.\\n\\nBen: Yup, brand is the power.\\n\\nDavid: Yes.\\n\\nBen: Okay, playbook. I called David earlier this week and said, we have a problem There's this really good part of the LVMH episode, and we're going to need to repeat it point for point on the Hermes episode, and that is why handbags are just the best freaking product to sell ever as a business. David planted the seed with me. Perhaps it's actually going to be a pretty different point once we really tell the whole story. David, you are right.\\n\\nThe point that was made on the LVMH episode are handbags are the best product ever because they're super easy to sell versus clothing. They don't require you trying anything on or sizing. You look at it. If you like it, you buy it, done. Much better than a fashion product. They're easier to create and produce than perfumes, which is another common luxury category\\n\\nThe profit margin is astounding for most luxury brands. The profit is between 10 and 12 times the cost to make them. At Louis Vuitton, it's something like 13 times, so there's this ease of creation. There's high volume according to annual consumer surveys that coach does the average American woman purchased two new handbags in 2000. By 2004, that number was more than four, so it's this high volume product.\\n\\nAt Louis Vuitton's immense four floor global store in Tokyo, 40% of all sales are made in the first room, which sells only monogrammed handbags, wallets, and other leather goods. Basically, none of these are true for Hermès. The business is not high volume or not nearly as high volume as they could be. In fact, they don't even show you handbags in their stores, so certainly not in that first room.\\n\\nDavid: It's amazing. At least in the Palo Alto Hermes, which is what I've most recently been in, you walk in and you would think this is a home wearers company. There's a lot of table wear and there's a lot of furniture.\\n\\nBen: There's clothing, there's ready to wear.\\n\\nDavid: There's clothing, there are some leather goods, and there are scarves. You would really think, wow, I'm in the most expensive Ikea ever.\\n\\nBen: It's such a funny way to describe it. In terms of trying on the handbags, when you do get your moment in the sun, and you have your 90-minute appointment and your glass of champagne, and you have the opportunity to buy one of the two or three Birkin bags that they have in store...\\n\\nDavid: You can't say no, you have already accepted.\\n\\nBen: Right. It doesn't have the benefit of saving square footage the way that I mentioned. Oh, you don't need to try on handbags. There's nothing to impede your velocity. Hermes is impeding your velocity, and they're taking up square footage with these private rooms for you to go and spend time in. They don't take advantage of that benefit either.\\n\\nThe only thing that it has in common are these goods are sold at a phenomenal margin, just like Louis Vuitton. I came around to this idea that actually, we're not making any of the same points at all. They managed to sell the same exact product category totally different, and they've constructed an entirely different business model around the same products.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. I think that's really the story here. Yes, there are other brands. There's Chanel, there's Gucci, there's Sicilia. I don't want to say that those luxury brands and those handbag brands are not incredible. They are, but there's Hermes and there's Louis Vuitton. They're both connected all the way back to Empress Eugenie, France, the nobility, and all of that. It's so interesting that they have such different strategies and they are the two pinnacles.\\n\\nBen: Right. This is a good moment to bring up this idea that Hermes likes to espouse that they have no marketing department.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This is a whimsical element of Hermes that I love.\\n\\nBen: Yes. They make the point that everyone at the company is responsible for marketing, which is wonderful. What a great comment, but there's some truth to it. There's obviously a lot of PR, events, and stuff that they do, but it's worth looking at some of the numbers. They spend 23% of their revenue on sales and marketing costs, but just a small fraction of that is actually on marketing or what they call communication. It's just 4.5% of their revenue.\\n\\nIf you compare that to LVMH, which spends over one third of their revenue on sales and marketing combined, that's 23% for sales and marketing at Hermes compared to 33% at LVMH. That's a huge difference. When you compare apples to apples just on marketing, LVMH says they spend 12% of total sales on advertising and promotion. Hermes spends 4.5% on communication. I think that is actually apples to apples.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, that's the media spend of Hermes, I believe.\\n\\nBen: It's still not right though. It's all marketing, that 4.5% versus 12%. Remember, you pointed out to me earlier before recording, two thirds of Hermes' communication is actually events. If you look at the remaining third, it might be as low as one and a half percent of their sales are actually spent on media buys for marketing compared to LVMH's 12%.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. This is really cool I saw a very large, splashy media buy from Hermes very recently. I was shocked when I saw it because I didn't expect it, but then doing all the research, understanding the strategy, it makes total sense to me. It was at the Ballet here in San Francisco at SFB at the program for Mere Mortals, which was as I talked about on the Novo Nordisk episode, we went to see at opening night, just incredible, incredible piece allegory for Pandora's box, AI, and ballet in the modern world here in San Francisco.\\n\\nThe back of the program was a full page Hermes ad. I was like, whoa, I think I texted you a picture. I was like, Hermes is buying full page marketing ads. But no, this is in the program at the ballet. This is not on the back of Vogue. There's a difference.\\n\\nBen: Right. This is, in some ways, event spend.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. It's much closer to that.\\n\\nBen: They also go really hard when they're going to spend money. They don't blanket the world. They decide these concentrated ways that they want to do something really unique and special. That's how they spend their media buys.\\n\\nDavid: Also, their event spend, you might say, wait, how did they spend twice as much on events as they do on media? You haven't read about Hermes events. Even just the pure marketing events like a store launch or product launch, they'll spend a million dollars on a party.\\n\\nBen: Right. Another place that they save a lot of money is that they don't do celebrity endorsements, unlike virtually every other luxury brand. This gets back to control, control, control. Hermes is the master of its own image. In these other companies, celebrities do dumb stuff all the time, and it reflects on the company. You have to change your spokesperson. You look at Kanye. You have to just decide to stick with him and tough it out, and Nike has done this a number of times, to say, we think we're going to come out the other side, and we think they're going to get through this.\\n\\nHermes, no. We control our own image, no one else reflects on us. Who needs celebrity endorsers when you make your products so desirable and so expensive that the celebrities will just buy them anyway, and they want to be seen in it? There are celebrities running around who get paid to endorse other brands, who will pay full price to wear Hermes out and about.\\n\\nDavid: Part of the status is getting the ability to buy one, getting the appointment with your SA, spending the money. That's part of the status.\\n\\nBen: Not only is it revenue generating and cost saving, but it's also more powerful than a paid endorsement because it's authentic. It is what the celebrity is choosing to do with their dollars.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. I'm pretty sure that Grace Kelly bought her Sac a Depeches.\\n\\nBen: Unbelievable. At the end of the day, the Hermes brand really has a tremendous amount of word of mouth from people who are big fans of it. The brand is built through the lore around the products. They just don't need to do that much media because they have a community. They have slowly organically built this, at this point, large number of people around the world that aspire to buy Hermes. Honestly, they just don't need to do that much marketing.\\n\\nDavid: This is going to sound absurd on the surface, but I think it's true. That audience is incredibly diverse. That audience is lots of customers in the Middle East. That audience is 40% plus China. That audience is still French people with the preface de in their names, i.e., old nobility. That audience is the wealthiest people in America. That audience is Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion.\\n\\nBen: As we talked about earlier, somehow there's something about the French heritage that everyone else is willing to, status wise, look up to and want to participate in.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. I don't think we want to go down this rabbit hole, but there is a whole TikTok and Instagram culture of Hermes sales associate appointments, Birkin appointments and reveals, and all that. It's huge. There are millions and millions of people that watch this.\\n\\nBen: Yup. One thing that we did not talk about is how they merchandise the stores. This is another thing that sets Hermes apart from other brands. They have a pull model versus a push model for all you software engineers out there. Basically, they embrace this idea that every store is for the local clientele and that store managers know their clients the best. Therefore, store managers should get to pick what is in each store.\\n\\nHeadquarters does not dictate what every store stocks, which is super different than every other brand. You open retail stores in order to just get your product out. The point is distribution. Whatever salespeople we hire to work at those stores, they're going to sell the same iPhones and iPads that we have everywhere else at every other store. That is not Hermes.\\n\\nAt Podium every year, which is this event that they have every six months where they show off all the new references, here's all the new designs for all the new products, each store manager gets a budget. They have the freedom to \\\"buy\\\" basically stock and get allocations of whatever they want at their store under the constraint that you can't ask for 120,000 Birkin bags at your one store.\\n\\nDavid: I believe there's also regulation that every store needs to carry at least one item from each métier.\\n\\nBen: That's cool. I didn't realize that. I like that.\\n\\nDavid: This operates like a retail buying event. It's bizarre, but awesome.\\n\\nBen: Even though they're wholly owned, they get the benefit of not being wholly owned.\\n\\nDavid: Right, the market signals.\\n\\nBen: The cool thing about a retailer that's decoupled from the manufacturer is that the retailer can stock whatever cool stuff they want. As long as the métiers are all producing a diverse set of references, then you actually do get this diversity of different things that are stocked at that store for that region. It leads to this cool thing that no two stores are identical. It's fun to see what this Hermes shop has versus that Hermes shop whenever you travel.\\n\\nDavid: There's a Costco treasure hunt element to it.\\n\\nBen: Yes, exactly. I will tell you, I was in the Aix-en-Provence store. Someone came in and said, I want to buy this particular item. The store manager said, well, we don't have it. They have a policy against anyone calling ahead to know what's where. He was asking, well, can you call the other store that I think was in Marseille or something like that and see if they have it there? She said, no, we don't do that. You can go there and you can find out.\\n\\nI think this person was trying to buy something and flip it. They were on to that. He was also trying to take pictures of things in the store and they said, you can't do that, sir. You can't take photos of what we have in stock, because they don't want people standing up websites to say, tip, go buy this here cause you can flip it online for that much. They have pretty tight controls around that.\\n\\nDavid: I love it. Luxury strategy, anti love marketing number six, dominate the client.\\n\\nBen: Dominate the client. Their ecommerce strategy is just pretty funny. It's not like you can go online and buy a Birkin bag, but there's not even a product detail page with a sold out button. There's just this educational page about what Birkin bags are all about, how neat the designs are, and what the category is.\\n\\nDavid: But there's no buy button.\\n\\nBen: It's also for a different audience. Interestingly, 70% of buyers online for all the stuff that you can buy online were new to Hermes. That's a great strategy for them for ecommerce that you say, look, the special things are the special things. But for people who we want to come experience the brand for the first time, great, we've got a website for you.\\n\\nI think you can sort of tell that internally they're torn, since that's not the full Hermes experience. You don't get the experiential part of being in the store. But they also do a lot of volume through it, it's a way to reach a new audience, and it's an expectation at this point.\\n\\nDavid: This is a really uniquely Hermes thing and is related to their airport strategy too. I experienced this too. When I went to Palo Alto, I just walked into the store. I was pretty intimidated as a first time buyer and you don't have an SA or sales associate relationship. It can feel very intimidating, especially knowing what I know about the company and the brand, the weight of history, walking into this store. It's not like walking into an Ikea.\\n\\nThis is very intentional, the ecommerce strategy. The airport strategy is, hey, nobody feels intimidated in an airport. Obviously, you don't have to have an appointment to walk into the airport Hermes store. It's a way to get first time buyers into the fold, establish the relationship with them, and get them more comfortable in this buying experience, which is wholly unique to Hermes.\\n\\nBen: Yup. In some ways, it seems wholly on Hermes. But in other ways, the Apple watch thing that they do or the perfume, they are looking for ways to be more approachable.\\n\\nDavid: Right.\\n\\nBen: Another one worth mentioning is employee turnover. The employees, especially the craftsmen, basically stay forever. As we've been saying, there's really no other game in town. If Hermes wasn't there, these people probably wouldn't have been trained to be craftsmen in the first place. What does that look like numerically? There is 6% annual turnover, and only 4.5% leave of their own desire. 4.5% of their entire workforce every year leaves of their own desire.\\n\\nDavid: That translates to a longer than 20-year average tenure. This is like Costco level employment retention.\\n\\nBen: It's funny you say that. Costco is 7% a year, but Costco cheats a little bit and that the stat is after the first year, whereas Hermes is attrition of 6% and includes the first year.\\n\\nDavid: Wow.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Just compare this with all industries in the US, that's a 3.4% monthly turnover. In the United States across all industries, and thanks to Jeremy Diamond in the Slack for pointing this out, one third of the entire workforce churns on average every year. When you're trying to figure out, is 6% good? Six percent is unbelievable, because the benchmark is 33%.\\n\\nDavid: Especially in the context of think about the two areas that are the bulk of Hermes' employees. It's craftspeople and sales associates.\\n\\nBen: Which if you are to use different language is manufacturing and retail, which are super high churn categories.\\n\\nDavid: Right, that's the point I'm making.\\n\\nBen: Even software developers churn at 15%-20% per year, and that's just the voluntary numbers. This is much better than software engineers who get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to have a very cushy job. Finally, let's go real apples to apples. Let's compare this to LVMH.\\n\\nLVMH is total turnover in 2022 was 24% versus Hermes' 6%. Hermes may be obsessed with this whole savoir faire, transmission of craft, and their annual report, but it is totally real. The entire thing works because of the knowledge and craft of their people.\\n\\nDavid: They have incredible YouTube videos and documentaries. They put out like you referenced. You go see these people and you really feel, like factories. They're not factories. These ateliers are something truly unique.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, and they're only getting more obsessed with controlling everything end to end. Hermes used to have 56% of retail locations that were company owned. This is back in 2003, so 20 years ago. A little over half were company owned. That's now 74%. They're getting rid of what they refer to as the concessionaires, which are essentially franchise stores and closing them in favor of the wholly owned businesses.\\n\\nAgain, they're just trying to figure out, how do we control more of our production of our everything soup to nuts? They describe this strategy as having three pillars. This is three pillars for their entire business. This is the strategy at the top of the annual report. Creation, craftsmanship, and an exclusive distribution network. That's probably the way to sum up Hermes.\\n\\nAll right, to close playbook, I just have one more, which is really this idea of, what is the job to be done by Hermes? I had this great conversation with Derek Guy. He's colloquially known on Twitter as the menswear guy, @dieworkwear is his handle. He has some amazing threads. They're very worth reading about if you're interested in ironing pants or why suits don't fit the way they used to.\\n\\nHe pointed out this really interesting thing to me, which is the value propositions of Hermes are essentially a bundle. That bundle is exclusivity, service, craftsmanship, shopping experience, and a great brand. You basically can't get that bundle anywhere else. That doesn't have competitors.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, you can get individual elements of that bundle elsewhere.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely.\\n\\nDavid: But by nature, given what this is in the luxury industry, you can't assemble this experience, the Hermes experience, out of separate components.\\n\\nBen: It used to exist. In a pre war, early 20th century era, you could. But Hermes was the only one that sort of chose to keep doing things the old way and scale, and everyone else kind of went out of business or changed their methodology to scale. For example, Louis Vuitton has the branding. They have exclusivity, but the craftsmanship isn't there. They don't make things in that early 20th century way.\\n\\nSupreme can offer you exclusivity and brand, but again, there's no real craftsmanship there. You've got all these individual artisans, a craftsperson and a little workshop somewhere in Paris making the highest quality, Hermes quality things, but there's no brand. Would you buy that? Would you pay even half the price for that? I think a lot of people who are buying Hermes are buying it because it's Hermes. And they want the brand.\\n\\nThere are other things that are missing from that too. There's no shopping experience, service is unknown because you don't know how long that maker is going to be around. You know for a fact that 50 years from now, you can get your Hermes thing serviced. There's some great makers like Chester Mox, April in Paris, or I heard great things about Mila Jito. These are exceptional craftsmen, hand making items in the same way, but it's a different bundle of value propositions.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, completely different product.\\n\\nBen: To me, what sums up the analysis is that the magic of what Hermes has done is managed to scale the old way with the complete bundle.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, totally agree. Nothing more to add.\\n\\nBen: Thanks, Charlie.\\n\\nDavid: All right, should we do value creation capture, and then we've got a new way to wrap up episodes here?\\n\\nBen: Yes This section was originally created by us five years ago or something to basically assess of the value created in the world. How much does the company actually capture of it? Canonically, Craigslist creates a ton of value. Wikipedia creates a ton of value. It capture's very little of it. On the other hand, Google create a lot of value, you can find stuff on the internet. They're pretty damn good at capturing it. They've built a huge business on that.\\n\\nThere, I think, is a reasonable indictment to make that many of you will want to make on all of luxury and say, it's just excess, they don't actually create value in the world, and then they capture a tremendous amount of value because they just have a brand that allows people to social signal, and all luxury is excess. That's a reasonable viewpoint.\\n\\nHowever, I think there's an interesting way to look at Hermes in particular, which is if what you desire is the highest quality craft they offer at an extreme price, a guarantee to be able to get that super high quality craft. That's different than every other luxury brand that is no longer about craftsmanship, but it's about hype and logos.\\n\\nDavid: Brands. Let's bring up brand and fashion.\\n\\nBen: Yes. I would say, Hermes has figured out that there actually is a pretty big niche for craftsmanship or at least people who desire the brand of craftsmanship, and they're exceptional at value capture around that.\\n\\nDavid: It's interesting. Yes, but the secondary market is this very direct, if you're talking purely about economic value creation, value capture. Very direct data point that, no, they are leaving a lot of surplus on the table for their consumers.\\n\\nBen: Another element to value creation, value capture is what they're doing good for the world, period, regardless of what they're able to capture. Anybody who's doing things with exotic leathers, you may have a problem with. Farmed crocodiles in mass quantities in order to create the Himalaya print Birkin bags\\n\\nDavid: There's actually a brief period where Jane Birkin boycotted Hermes bags and asked them to take her name off of them.\\n\\nBen: Do you know how that got solved? Why is she cool with it now?\\n\\nDavid: I could be wrong, but I believe this is when Hermes took the crocodile farming in-house and improved a lot of the animal welfare standards.\\n\\nBen: For everyone who's like, it's absolutely cruel to do this to crocodiles, to make handbags, Hermes doesn't really have a counterpoint. They don't have like a, well, they live good lives. That's not a part of their defense. Their defense is purely around sustainable farming, which is, hey, these are endangered species in many scenarios with these exotic leathers. What we do is for the ones that we farm, we also release a bunch into the wild to try to replenish the population.\\n\\nEven though we're not actually taking away from the population in the wild because we're not hunting them, we are trying to, almost in an eye for an eye way, say, look, we're creating a bunch of crocodiles, so we're releasing a bunch of them into nature also. I don't know, it sits medium with me.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. It's not a great response.\\n\\nBen: Right. Similarly, you see piles and piles and piles of cow hides for the leather production. The response is, well, look, these were beef cows, so we're basically doing. a good thing by making sure that we use the whole animal since we were going to use it anyway for sustenance somewhere else in humanity.\\n\\nDavid: To me, that is a better argument than we farm the crocodiles for the skins. It's funny. Actually, doing the Novo Nordisk episode gave me a new perspective on this with animal products, and obviously insulin doesn't come from animals anymore. It's genetically engineered, but a lot of pigs and cows went into producing insulin for many many many decades. That's a new perspective to look at things because people would have died otherwise. Is that what's happening here with Hermes? Absolutely not.\\n\\nBen: Right. Other brands, Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld, Mulberry, a bunch of them are banning exotic leathers in their products. I think Hermes has played around with mushroom leather, but do I think Hermes is going to go all vegan anytime soon? Absolutely not. It's just not happening.\\n\\nThe last thing that you can definitely be mad about if you are into animal welfare is the fact that Hermes cares so deeply about their brand that they burn imperfect products so they never see the light of day. That's a bummer. I understand Hermes' position of not wanting these bags to get out there and have their brand on it. People realize, oh, some Birkin bags look crappy. But if you're destroying product that could otherwise have utility, especially when it's made from animals, bummer.\\n\\nDavid: Agreed.\\n\\nBen: They spend a lot of time in their annual report talking about how much more they're getting efficient in their manufacturing processes, how the rates of this are going down. They don't specifically call out burning bags, but how they're able to use more and more of the raw material and have everything that goes in the top of the funnel get used in products all the way at the bottom of the funnel. The company has taken a lot of heat for it over the years, and it's something that they spend a lot of time working on.\\n\\nAll right. David, I think that brings us to the question, which is, what is your big takeaway from this episode? What is a big idea you're obsessed with after spending all this time with Hermes?\\n\\nDavid: We've been struggling for a while with, how do we end these episodes, these books that we're in right now?\\n\\nBen: Right, we're not going to grade them the way that we used to grade.\\n\\nDavid: Right, that doesn't make sense. That was always hokey anyway. We've done bear case and bull case. Again, are we going to do that better than an equity research analyst? I don't know.\\n\\nBen: Importantly, bear case bull case has to take into account what people's current expectations, so you have to dissect the stock price.\\n\\nDavid: Right, which isn't really the point of Acquired.\\n\\nBen: Right. We figure by the time you get to this point of the episode, you already have a bear case and a bull case in your head. It's not like we're going to sit here and paint, well, if people keep being excited about luxury goods...\\n\\nDavid: Here's an incredible new insight that will change your perspective on the stock. No.\\n\\nBen: Right.\\n\\nDavid: We've been casting about for honestly a while here of like, how do we land the plane on these episodes? What we're trying here for the first time, and let us know what you think if you like it, is in a very Hermes like way, we dedicate really a month plus of our life to each of these episodes. This is all we're doing for certainly the last four weeks. Every day we've been getting up, we've been studying this company, we've been writing. It's insane.\\n\\nBen: It's craft. We joke, but it's craft.\\n\\nDavid: Really, like you said, Ben, this episode started a year ago when we did the LVMH episode, and it's been percolating and percolating and percolating. The last four weeks, it's been every waking moment for us. I think a fun way to try to end the episode is when we wake up in the middle of the night and Hermes is on our mind, what are the aspects of Hermes and why?\\n\\nIt ends up being personal for us. What resonates for us from having told this story, done this work, and what resonates for Acquired, honestly? For me, we've touched on this a little bit throughout the episode with the whimsy and the dream element of Hermes, but there's something also to this company that I think is deeply interconnected with the fact that it's on the sixth generation of the family.\\n\\nYou ask yourself, how is that possible? How six generations later is this company stronger than ever, and the family members are more committed than ever to running it? I think it's because they have fun. Again, this comes through in the whimsy. This comes through in the annual reports. This comes through when you watch the interviews with Axel and Pierre-Alexis, when you read the articles, and hear people talk like Beatrice about Jean-Louis, they are really having fun doing what they're doing.\\n\\nIt's an amazing culture, and it's hard to have in an environment where you are also, I think, the 47th largest market cap company in the world. I think about other companies, it's about winning. You think about a professional sports team. I think my mind goes to like the New England Patriots. Honestly, it goes to like Benchmark and Sequoia, like the best venture capital firms out there. These are organizations that are 100% dedicated to winning. It's not that Hermes isn't dedicated to winning, but they're even more so dedicated to having fun and enjoying themselves.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. They’re fun and they're staying true to their identity. Both of those things are more important than winning some numerical game.\\n\\nDavid: Right. For me, that's the splinter in my mind over the last set of months with Hermes. Honestly, it's what acquired is for me and for us. Hermes could go out tomorrow and they could follow the consultants. They could borrow a page from the LVMH playbook, and they could vastly increase their sales and profitability overnight. If they were solely focused on winning, that might be what they do, but they are never going to do that.\\n\\nBen: But if they do that, it's still only a short term right thing to do.\\n\\nDavid: Right. I think it's tied into this short term, long term perspective thing. The reason I say it's fun is the family wants to keep doing this. If it weren't fun, they would probably maximize value, they would hit the short term bid, and they would sell to Bernard. But they don't.\\n\\nBen: Yup, I love that. The splinter in my mind is that you can sell what on the face of it seems like the same type of products as someone else, but build two entirely different businesses. Louis Vuitton and Hermes, on the face of it, do the same thing. As soon as you start digging in, you realize that these companies could not be more different. All of the puzzle pieces that fit together to create Hermes is an entirely different puzzle than the pieces that fit together to create Louis Vuitton.\\n\\nIt's a great reminder that just because you are in the same product category as someone else, you don't have to build a similar business, and you might not even be competing with them. There's a large number of people for whom Louis Vuitton and Hermes are not actually in a consideration set together ever. I think that's fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: Right. These are Mutually exclusive brands for a lot of people. Certainly not all, but a lot of people. I was thinking about that too a little bit in the context of, oftentimes in a market, the best way to compete with your best competitor is to do the exact opposite of them, it's not to compete with them.\\n\\nBen: Or at least be open to a, we don't have to do anything alike. Open to that idea.\\n\\nDavid: Right. This is Android and iOS.\\n\\nBen: Right.\\n\\nDavid: All right. That's our landing of the Hermes plane. Let us know what you think. I just love doing this one. This was one of the most enjoyable experiences for me. All of our episodes are, but I just really loved this one.\\n\\nBen: Sometimes we get to learn about an industry that's interesting to know things about like healthcare or something we're a fan of, like the NFL episode. But sometimes we do an episode like Hermes and it really teaches us how to run our own business. Again, Acquired is not luxury, but we do create a product that has real scarcity, both on the listener front, because we only have an episode a month and on the sponsor front, because we only have three sponsors a season. There is so much to learn studying the purity of Hermes when you run a business that's predicated on scarcity.\\n\\nDavid: Yes.\\n\\nBen: This one was extra indulgent for you and I.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, totally. Okay, carveouts. Let's do it. What you got?\\n\\nBen: I have three.\\n\\nDavid: Fun.\\n\\nBen: And none of them are a Vision Pro, even though the Vision Pro is sitting next to me on my desk. The reason is not because I can't recommend it, but because this is Acquired, and we can't possibly do anything that's too current. I need more time to evaluate.\\n\\nDavid: The Hermes of podcast indeed.\\n\\nBen: Okay. First one, the Anker Prime charger. I'll give you the model number, because Anker products are impossible to figure out what's what. This is the A2343 model. It is a 100-watt charger that has two USB C ports and one USB A port, and it is tiny. It's lightweight. It's dense. You'll pick it up and be like, oh, my God, this is really heavy, but it's lightweight compared to large bricks.\\n\\nHere's the important thing. In those diagonal airline charging seats, you can plug it in and it doesn't fall out. It's a hundred watts. You can super fast charge phone, laptop, whatever. There are two ports, two USB ports and one USB A, and it works on airlines. It's the only thing that I travel with now. It's the new gallium nitride GAN charging technology, which I think is totally game changing.\\n\\nDavid: Nice. I've got a 60-watt Anker that is same concept. Totally, the  only thing I travel with.\\n\\nBen: Is it gallium nitride?\\n\\nDavid: No, it's a few years old.\\n\\nBen: Okay, yeah. I don't understand why nobody's talking about it, because it feels like it completely revolutionized chargers. It makes everything 50% the size, even though it has super high power delivery.\\n\\nDavid: I might need to upgrade my travel setup. Maybe I need an Hermes leather case for it.\\n\\nBen: Might need to do it. All right, we'll link it in the show notes. Two more are apps, websites, or web services. I don't know what we're supposed to call them these days. The first one is an app called Matter, which I have replaced. For years, I used Instapaper. It was great, but it just hasn't been touched in forever.\\n\\nMatter is Instapaper but better. It is also an amazing way to listen to things that you save in a very realistic voice. Long time listeners know, I don't absorb stuff very well by reading. I absorb it really well by listening.\\n\\nDavid: You're talking about text to speech, not saving podcast episodes.\\n\\nBen: Correct. You can save podcast episodes, but you can forward an email newsletter and have that read it to you. You can use the bookmarklet on a website and have it read it to you. It bundles in text to speech, podcasts, email newsletters, and read it later type services into one app. I did half the research for this by taking long things to read including PDFs. It has an ability to parse PDFs now and listening while running.\\n\\nMy son was asleep in a carrier and I'm walking around the house, I'm in a dark room somewhere, or I'm on the treadmill in the garage. I really like Matter. The team behind it is awesome. They actually were kind enough to reach out and have David and I collaborate with them on a couple of guest blog posts for their Words that Matter series of some of our favorite readings and writings of all time. The team was great, which was my entree into it, but the product has exceeded expectations.\\n\\nDavid: Okay. I haven't actually tried the app yet. I love those guys, now I got to try the app.\\n\\nBen: It's awesome. My third one is another thing that dramatically has helped my research, which is Perplexity AI.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah.\\n\\nBen: If I could stop using Google, I would, because Perplexity is better for everything that I use to Google, period.\\n\\nDavid: Wow, okay. All right, we got to have Perplexity on ACQ2 or something. More to come on this.\\n\\nBen: It's all the good things about ChatGPT, all the good things about Google, and none of the bad things of either. It's reliable, it links to sources, it has good UI. I trust it because I've fact checked it so many times, and it just keeps being right. It makes it easy to fact check. Accessing information is one of these things that if it's 97% good, it's bad. So it needs to be always good.\\n\\nDavid: Honestly, this is why I don't use ChatGPT for acquired work, I feel like we need to be a hundred percent all the time.\\n\\nBen: Here's the best use case for perplexity. The other day, I couldn't find something on Google. I went over to perplexity, I asked it the question, and it said, the answer to this is unknown on the internet. I was like, that is amazing. You just gave me confidence.\\n\\nDavid: Getting that answer. Otherwise, you're going to spend half an hour on Google trying to find it.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: That's amazing.\\n\\nBen: It was both time saving and confidence inducing.\\n\\nDavid: I love it. Okay. I've heard from so many people about Perplexity. I got to give it a go in the next episode research.\\n\\nBen: It's phenomenal.\\n\\nDavid: I'm so disappointed in myself, but also it's just the reality of my life right now. I've become the middle of the bell curve technology adopter. I used to be the bleeding edge early adopter. Man, getting old is hard. Joanna Stern had a great quote about this in the Wall Street Journal, and she was interviewed by Ben Thompson recently. She said, \\\"Man, I wish I had the access that I have now when I was younger.\\\" I would be unstoppable pulling all nighters. I'd be using it to its full degree. I don't have the energy now. I got kids. I'm like, man, I feel that.\\n\\nBen: That's the paradox. You often do your best work when you get older, even though you have less time because you're wiser, your information's better.\\n\\nDavid: Your access, everything.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. You've gotten better at your craft. You can never have both, but you live your life anyway. You'll make it through.\\n\\nDavid: What's the Dune quote? Life is not a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, I think that is it.\\n\\nDavid: There you go. Okay, my carve out. We are recording this. By the time the episode comes out, the Super Bowl will have been played and won by somebody. Man, I am fired up. Go Niners, San Francisco 49ers, Brock Purdy. Hell yeah. I'm channeling my inner JT O'Sullivan and QB School YouTube channel here. I'm so excited. Brock's story is amazing. I was trying to think, okay, I can't have the Niners and the Super Bowl be my carve out.\\n\\nBen: Especially if this airs after they lose. Are we leaving it in?\\n\\nDavid: Right, especially if they lose. But what I can have as my carve out and is perfect for Acquired, years ago, I read Bill Walsh's book. Bill Walsh was the legendary coach of the 49ers during the Joe Montana, Steve Young era. He invented the West Coast offense. He wrote this book called The Score Takes Care of Itself, and it's so good. It's just like a great leadership book, but the title says it all.\\n\\nIt's related to Hermes, it's related to Acquired. It's the splinter in the mind, everything we've been talking about. It includes some ideas like scripting. This is now so commonplace in the NFL and football everywhere, but everybody scripts out your first set of 5, 10, 20 plays, et cetera. Bill Walsh invented that. We do the same thing on Acquired. We have scripts, I have a script, and you have a script. Obviously, the episode doesn't follow the script any more than an NFL game.\\n\\nBen: But you need a way to start that's predictable or at least something you've thought through.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Obviously, Bill Walsh didn't invent that idea writ large, but he invented it for the NFL. There's also some really good stuff in there about when to persist with doing something different and continue to do it versus stop doing it, and what are the right reasons to do it? Especially in the early days when it's working or not working, I'm thinking about launching the Birkin and all that. Anyway, it's a great book. Bill Walsh was a legendary figure. Go Niners. Hell yeah.\\n\\nBen: There you go. Wishing you the best of luck. Listeners, you know it already happened.\\n\\nDavid: Either way, I'm celebrating because either the Niners won, or we're going to see a lot of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, so I'm thrilled.\\n\\nBen: I tweeted this that Taylor plus the NFL is literally the perfect bundle, because they've both fully saturated their markets that Taylor is America's musical cultural icon of this moment. There's no one who could be a Taylor superfan. That's not already a Taylor superfan. The NFL similarly has had close to a hundred year history, and it is the fullest realization of itself already. The NFL is America's sport, so they've already got all the superfans they're going to get. By bundling together, this is so awful.\\n\\nDavid: No, this is the ultimate collab.\\n\\nBen: Yes. They can address each other as casual fans who wouldn't have tuned in specifically for one or the other.\\n\\nDavid: Taylor is a hundred percent thing. I'm not saying she's dating Travis because of this, but Taylor is one of the smartest CEOs in the world, writ large, period, bar none. Of course, she's thinking about this.\\n\\nBen: Yup. What's the phrase that Shishir Mehrotra used? The marginal churn contribution. There are people who will not turn off the Super Bowl who otherwise would have because there might be another Taylor viewing.\\n\\nDavid: Jenny has negative interest in football, but she's telling me about what Taylor is wearing, whether she's going to be able to make it back from Japan from the Super Bowl.\\n\\nBen: We'll see. All right, listeners, we have a bunch of thank yous. Huge thank you to Domenico De Sole, the former CEO of Gucci and the co-founder of Tom Ford with Tom Ford. Domenico, your conversation was just invaluable in preparing for this episode, and obviously, yes, a legend. Adam Pritzker, a good friend of the show, is the co-founder of Assembled Brands and the company Kate, which is in the fashion and luxury space. Adam is Super kind and a huge contributor to this episode, just like he was to LVMH.\\n\\nTo Derek Guy, who is @dieworkwear on Twitter for teaching me about saddle stitching, what makes Hermes special, and a bunch of the other brands that we mentioned that do boutique leather goods, and for putting April in Paris on my radar. That was very helpful. Reginald-Jerome de Mans or RJ, which is a funny pen name, he wrote a book called Swan Songs: Souvenirs of Paris Elegance. He's obsessed, for lack of a better phrase, with Parisian luxury and the history of it. It was really educational to talk with him about this and fact check a lot of my Hermes history.\\n\\nFinally, there is a lot written about the company. I do think the best way to understand Hermes is just to go right to the source. There are 586-page annual report. They just lay out the whole strategy. If you're curious about the company, that's an amazing place to look.\\n\\nDavid: It's funny, we did not talk to anyone at the company we'd usually never do when we're making an episode.\\n\\nBen: It's just awkward.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. We usually talk to them afterwards, but not during. In this case, we didn't need to. It's right there. They wrote down everything.\\n\\nBen: Yup. David, I know you had a couple of cool conversations.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Speaking of April in Paris, Beatrice Amblard here in San Francisco, was so fun to talk to, an actual former Hermes artisan. There's personal stories of Jean-Louis and the family. They really gave me a sense of just how special the family is, the company is, and the work that they do.\\n\\nI also have to think Lauren Sherman. Lauren is, I think, pretty much bar none, the very best business of fashion and business of luxury reporter out there. She was at the business of fashion for a long time. She's now at Puck. She's Puck's fashion correspondent. She launched the fashion vertical for Puck.\\n\\nLauren is awesome. I chatted with her for a long time. She gave me a lot of great perspective on Hermes within the industry. Really, there are a few journalists out there. I'm thinking of Brad Stone, Emily Chang at Bloomberg, and Kara Swisher obviously, but they're incredible journalists. They really, really understand the business and the industry that they're covering, and Lauren is one of those. It was super great to get to chat with her.\\n\\nBen: Yup.

How is it?\\n\\nBen: I really like it.\\n\\nDavid: Nice.\\n\\nBen: I think it is reductionist to call it country.\\n\\nDavid: I was appropriately enough listening to Start Me Up through the ages.\\n\\nBen: Of course you were. But I feel like a David Rosenthal move is that you might have been listening to Start Me Up whether we were doing Microsoft or not. That\\'s a very squarely in your genre song.\\n\\nDavid: The Stones though, man, it\\'s crazy. They\\'re in their 70s–80s.\\n\\nBen: Amazing.\\n\\nDavid: Man, I hope we\\'re in our 70s and 80s dancing on stage.\\n\\nBen: Season 126.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah.\\n\\nBen: All right, let\\'s do it.\\n\\nDavid: Let\\'s do it.\\n\\nBen: Welcome to season 14, episode 4 of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. I\\'m Ben Gilbert.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'m David Rosenthal.\\n\\nBen: And we are your hosts. We often remark that selling software is the best business model of all time. Today, finally, we tell the story of the company that created that business, Microsoft.\\n\\nDavid: Finally, we\\'re 10 years into Acquired. We\\'re finally doing it.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s been daunting. We wanted to do it for a while, but it takes some chutzpah to tackle Microsoft.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'m so fired up. We\\'re ready. It\\'s time.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, Microsoft today is sprawling and massive. It is the world\\'s most valuable company worth over $3 trillion. They have 49 years of history making software for consumers and enterprises, making hardware, gaming systems, gaming studios, Windows apps, iPad apps, Mac apps, operating systems, mobile operating systems, MP3 players, search engines, cloud computing, services on cloud computing, programming languages, development environments, and the list goes on. But it did not start out that way.\\n\\nToday, we will tell the story of the desktop software company. Before the enterprise, before IT, before the Internet, before being a trusted partner to governments around the free world, and really, before people even knew what to do with personal computers, this is the story of a bunch of ragtag geniuses in their 20s pushing what was possible.

If you want more from David and I, you should check out our second show, ACQ2, where we interview founders, investors, and experts often as a deeper dive into topics we cover on the main show. Before we dive in, we want to briefly thank our presenting sponsor, JP Morgan Payments.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, just how we say every company has a story, every company\\'s story is powered by payments. JP Morgan Payments is a part of so many journeys from seed to IPO and beyond.\\n\\nBen: With that, this show is not investment advice. David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss and likely all of you if you hold any index funds, and the show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. David, where on earth do we start the Microsoft story?\\n\\nDavid: We\\'re right down the middle on this one. We\\'re going to start in 1955 in Seattle, Washington with the birth of Bill Gates III or Trey as he\\'s known growing up. It\\'s so confusing because his dad is the second, but he goes by Senior, and Bill is Junior/III/Trey. Bill is born in 1955 as the second of three children to Bill and Mary Gates. Bill Gates Sr. (his father), is from Bremerton, the Navy town just across the sound from Seattle, where he grows up in a family that owns and runs a furniture store there, a long way from the software king of the world here.\\n\\nBill Gates Sr./II, after high school, he joins the Army during World War II, serves during World War II, and then he goes, I presume on the GI Bill to the University of Washington, where he\\'s the first member of his family to go to college. There he gets an undergrad and a law degree in four years, and then decides to stay in Seattle with his new family and become a practicing attorney.\\n\\nI say family because at the U-Dub, he meets and marries one Mary Maxwell. Mary, I don\\'t know how to put it other than that she is a force. Mary\\'s family had founded National City Bank, and her father was a senior executive at First Interstate Bank, which later became a big part of Wells Fargo. Mary, despite being the daughter of a successful business family in that day and age, was not cast aside like so many other daughters we\\'ve talked about on the show.\\n\\nBen: New York Times, Hermes, where it was passed to the son-in-law to continue to run the business. That was not the case with Mary Maxwell.\\n\\nDavid: No. After she graduates from the U-Dub, she becomes first the president of the Seattle Junior League. She starts joining nonprofit boards in Seattle as a very young woman. She joins the Seattle Symphony Board, the Chamber of Commerce, the Children\\'s Hospital, the King County United Way. She\\'s such a force on these boards that she starts getting asked by her fellow board members to join their company\\'s boards too. The corporate boards were so impressed with her.\\n\\nFirst, she joins the board of First Interstate Bank, the bank that her family\\'s a part of. Then she joins the board of Cairo Television in Seattle. She even ends up joining the Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Board.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s right, part of the AT&T breakup.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Eventually, she joins the Board of Regents of the University of Washington and the entire national United Way board. She never works full-time in a corporate setting, but it is not an overstatement at all to say that Mary Gates became one of the most powerful business people in the Pacific Northwest, period.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely, and Bill Gates Sr. was the prominent attorney in the region, so it\\'s quite the power couple.\\n\\nDavid: Ben, it\\'s like you\\'re reading my script here. Yes. We don\\'t want to give Bill Sr. the short shrift here either. He becomes a superstar lawyer, and he becomes a co-founding partner of the firm Preston, Gates, and Ellis, which today, I didn\\'t even realize until I dug in the research, that is K&L Gates today, one of the largest law firms in the world.\\n\\nAnother fun fact that you probably know about Bill Gates Sr., but we got to, this being Acquired, talk about. Do you know what corporate board he joined later in life?\\n\\nBen: I do not.\\n\\nDavid: Costco.\\n\\nBen: Of course, Bill Gates Sr., we should say too, basically galvanized the entrepreneurial community in Seattle. He started the tech alliance. He was a huge angel investor. He really did organize angel investors, people who want to put high risk capital to work into startups. His heart was there, obviously, through his law practice, long before Bill Gates III became the prodigy he became.\\n\\nDavid: Totally, and that\\'s the point we want to land here. For young Bill, Trey growing up here, he is growing up in a pretty unique household. He would later talk about being 9 or 10 years old. Most nights at dinner at his house, there would be a CEO, a senator, a governor, or somebody who\\'s just over for dinner, and Bill would sit there and absorb the business conversation. It\\'s like the Hermes family, the Dumas family that we talked about in that episode. This whole thing makes me think of Paul, the main character in the Dune movies in the book. He\\'s bred from birth to be this incredible business mind.\\n\\nBen: At age 13, with his best friend, who we will talk about very soon, he brought up the idea, I wonder what company I will be the CEO of when I grow up. What industry will I go after? What problems will I tackle? It wasn\\'t a question of if, but which.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. It just turned out that He would be the CEO and founder of the biggest company in the biggest industry ever to exist. The other thing that we got to say about Bill growing up, he is insanely competitive. He did not and does not like to lose at anything. That is putting it mildly, whether it\\'s sports, swimming, computers, school, or the classroom.\\n\\nThere\\'s a quote in one of the books we read from a childhood friend of his who says, \"Everything Bill did, he did competitively and never simply to relax.\" I think this used to be more than today. There\\'s this image of Bill Gates that he was a computer nerd, that he was this shy little skinny kid. The way he looks doesn\\'t help this, but that is not the case at all. This guy had a competitive fire in him, I\\'m sure he still does like none other.\\n\\nBen: Both things can be true. He was the number one math student in the State of Washington. He was a nerdy kid, a brilliant kid, and also fiercely competitive. His childhood friend and co-founder of Microsoft, Paul Allen, would say about him, “You could tell three things about Bill Gates pretty quickly. He was really smart, he was really competitive, and he wanted to show you how smart he was. And he was really, really persistent.”\\n\\nDavid: That sounds about right. Famously, speaking of Paul and where Bill and Paul meet, when Bill is in seventh grade, his parents enroll him at the Lakeside School, which now I think is internationally famous because of Bill. It is a super rigorous college prep school, middle school, and high school. Bill ends up writing the scheduling software for class scheduling that he puts himself in the classes with all the girls. Funny.\\n\\nThis Bill, 13 years old, seventh grade, Lakeside, this is when it starts. Obviously, Microsoft doesn\\'t start. But during that year, Bill is 13 years old, the Lakeside Mothers Club raises money to buy the school a teletype, connect it up, and rent computer time from a DEC PDP 10 that is located in downtown Seattle and owned by the branch office there of General Electric.\\n\\nProbably a bunch of you are like, I have no idea what any of those words mean, so we got to set some context. This is 1968, the Beatles, Vietnam, the Summer of Love. This is not the computer age.\\n\\nBen: 2001, A Space Odyssey had just come out.\\n\\nDavid: Nolan Bushnell has not founded Atari yet. Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore are only just leaving Fairchild Semiconductor to start Intel. Silicon Valley is still dominated by Lockheed. There is no such thing as a microprocessor.\\n\\nBen: The United States would land on the moon one year later.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. The way computing worked back then, it was basically still the ENIAC days. A computer meant two things. It either meant a massive room sized machine that had about the computing power of a calculator, or it meant a human. People talked about computers as humans. Have you ever seen the movie Hidden Figures about the black women who did the calculations?\\n\\nBen: Yes. Those women were the computers.\\n\\nDavid: They were called the computers, yes.\\n\\nBen: Because they would sit there and compute.\\n\\nDavid: This was a totally different era. The idea that a 13-year-old kid in this high school, this middle school would get access to share computer time, I can\\'t imagine there are many other secondary schools in the country that were doing this.\\n\\nBen: This is a very early place to make the point. Microsoft is the result of tremendous intelligence, brilliant strategy, fierce competition, and an unbelievable amount of luck. Bill Gates was born in 1955, the same year as Steve Jobs, to come into adulthood just as the personal computer wave is starting.\\n\\nThe fact that he was at a middle school and had this much privilege, where he could get access to a PDP-10 at this point in his life to help him understand how important computers would become, there are dozens of people in America who are as well-situated as Bill is, and that might be overly generous.\\n\\nDavid: He and Paul got a sneak peek into the future there at Lakeside. It\\'s funny, you said the personal computer era. We are so far away from the personal computer here. We got us at the stage. What is computing? I mentioned ENIAC and these room-sized things.\\n\\nComputers did not have screens. You didn\\'t have cursors, you didn\\'t have lights, you didn\\'t have pixels. Everything was done on a teletype that looked like typewriters, and they were wired up remotely either in the same facility or what Lakeside is doing. You could be remote. It\\'s almost the cloud today.\\n\\nBen: And it called over a phone line. That was the teletype.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Got wired over the phone line, hooked up to these mainframes. You typed commands into this teletype, and then the response came back over the phone line or over whatever cable from the mainframe. It got printed out on a spool of tape on the teletype. But this is power that normal 13-year-olds don\\'t come anywhere near accessing.\\n\\nWhat is the computing market at this time? It is pretty much—we\\'ll come back to the pretty much in a minute—100% dominated by IBM. IBM, Big Blue, Big Iron is what it was referred to, the products that they would produce, were the industry.\\n\\nBen: Ben Thompson has a fantastic quote on this. He has an article called, What is a Tech Company? And here\\'s his comment. \"Fifty years ago, what is a tech company was an easy question to answer. IBM was the tech company, and everybody else was IBM\\'s customers. That may be a slight exaggeration, but not by much. IBM built the hardware, at that time the System 360, They wrote the software, including the operating system and the application, and provided services including training, ongoing maintenance, and custom line of business software.”\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, System 360 was a line of solutions, I would say, offered by IBM. It consisted of the room-sized thing, the mainframe, the software, which was system 360, and the consulting and the implementation. You couldn\\'t just call up UPS and forklift one of these things into a company and expect it to work. No, you got to operate this thing too.\\n\\nBen: Totally, it\\'s like ASML machines. You don\\'t just ship them off to TSMC and say, good luck making semiconductors. It\\'s a full solution, full service thing. But an important thing that was also happening this year, 1968, was that IBM was undergoing some antitrust scrutiny over that huge bundle that I just told you about.\\n\\nDoesn\\'t it smell antitrust? They do everything from the hardware to the software to the operating system, the service, the support. They are the whole market. They\\'re starting to get concerned. Proactively, they unbundled hardware, software, and services. They started selling those separately for the first time, which was not a problem at first. What it did was it cracked the door for customers to say, oh, I can buy hardware from IBM and software from someone else? Other people were not exploiting this, but it was possible.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, interesting. It cracks the door for Microsoft 15–20 years later.\\n\\nBen: Yes, but this is where the seeds are sown of what is the exploitable opportunity when Bill Gates is ready to do something.\\n\\nDavid: Interesting. Back to the timing thing for Bill, Paul, and Microsoft. I mentioned when we were setting this up that there\\'s something else to talk about here. IBM was facing a disruptive force at this moment, I think, probably for the first time in its history, certainly in the computing era of IBM\\'s history, and that was the Digital Equipment Corporation or DEC. Noticed when we said earlier that Lakeside is renting computer time from the General Electric computer in downtown Seattle, I said it\\'s a deck PDP-10. It\\'s not an IBM product.\\n\\nWhat\\'s DEC? They\\'re the \"mini\" computer company. Mini meaning it was the size of a closet, not the size of a room. It\\'s all relative. DEC had been started by this guy, Ken Olson from MIT.\\n\\nWhat they did, he had this brilliant insight that would play out over and over and over again in technology that I\\'m not going to go compete with IBM head on, I\\'m not going to make any act. I\\'m not going to make mainframes.\\n\\nBut computing has advanced enough that there\\'s an opportunity to make something smaller, less powerful, more toy-like, and there\\'s enough demand out there that I think they can find some new markets for people who will buy those types of computers and it’s smaller businesses. But in particular, it\\'s branch offices of the big company.\\n\\nI am sure General Electric bought lots and lots and lots of IBM mainframes and products at their headquarters, but the GE field office in Seattle is not going to truck in a mainframe.\\n\\nBen: And in 1968, Seattle is a provincial little town. I\\'m standing here right now. It\\'s a major city and a huge economy in the United States. But at the time, a podunk, forgotten, sleepy, faraway place.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Microsoft would go a long way to changing that over time.\\n\\nBen: We should say this is the classic low-end disruption playbook. This is what Clayton Christensen was talking about. Going from mainframe to mini computers, I\\'m going to make something that\\'s worse for most things, but better for some new things that new customers and new markets are going to care a lot about. IBM\\'s going to look at it and go, that can\\'t do any of the things that are important to our customers. And that\\'s exactly why it works.\\n\\nDavid: Specifically, why are they not going to care about it? I don\\'t know exactly what an IBM mainframe system, System 360, 370, whatever cost. I\\'m imagining tens of millions of dollars all in total cost, maybe hundreds of millions of total dollars to run a system like that and buy it.\\n\\nThe first DEC machine, when it comes out, the PDP-1, a few years before this time, was priced at $120,000, so an order of magnitude, maybe two below a system that you would buy from IBM. Obviously still a long, long, long way from the personal computer. People are not buying these things for their houses, but GE will buy one for the field office in Seattle, or universities will buy them for research, for their students, for their professors.\\n\\nDEC creates a new market for computing. Bill, he\\'s so studied in business history, the founder, Ken Olson is Bill\\'s hero. He totally looks up to DEC and what DEC\\'s done. The DEC and minicomputer UI is still the same as the mainframe. You\\'re still using a teletype. There\\'s no innovation in terms of what computing is or how you use it. It\\'s just cheaper and more people have access to it.\\n\\nBack to Lakeside and the Mother\\'s Club raising money for this access here for the school, Bill, remember, he\\'s just started. He\\'s in seventh grade, and Lakeside is a middle school in a high school. The high school is actually in a separate building. The computer room that gets installed with the teletypes was over in the high school, but Bill doesn\\'t care. He gets exposed to it in a math class one day and he\\'s like, oh, I\\'m hooked.\\n\\nHe goes over. He\\'s hanging out with the high schoolers, teaches himself how to program, and pretty quickly he becomes known as one of the very best programmers there. He and three other kids form what they call themselves the Lakeside Programmers Group. One of his buddies who he forms it with is of course the high schooler or I think the 10th grader at the time, Paul Allen.\\n\\nBen: There is a fantastic photo, listeners, that we will tweet of Bill and Paul sitting in the computer room at Lakeside. Bill, I think he\\'s 13–14. He looks like he\\'s about eight. I think on the wall, there\\'s this almost printed out magazine thing that says the bug slayer that they\\'ve hung up over the wall. It\\'s amazing.\\n\\nDavid: These high school kids, they start the Lakeside Programmers Group. They call it the programmers group because they are programmers. This is another super important thing to learn. To use a computer at this time meant to be a programmer. There was no package software that you bought. The software that IBM was selling was the operating system to make the machines actually function, and it was the programming languages that you could then program on but you weren\\'t clicking around and using Excel or pulling up apps. Everybody who used a computer wrote their own software.\\n\\nBen: Right. There was not this multi-sided network of you\\'ve got developers making applications, and then you\\'ve got users of those applications. No, everybody who used a computer was a programmer.\\n\\nDavid: The goal of the Lakeside Programmers Group, remember Bill is this business prodigy, is to use their very valuable and very rare skills as programmers at this time to make money, do a business.\\n\\nIt turns out at the same time—the coincidences here are just crazy—there is a local startup coming out of the University of Washington called the Computer Center Corporation or C-Cubed. The business plan behind C-Cubed was that they were going to get a bunch of DECs, a bunch of PDP-8s, PDP-10s, PDP-11s, whatever, and they were going to be AWS. They were going to just be a computer time-sharing company.\\n\\nC-Cubed hires the Lakeside Programmers Group, these kids, to come in and find and document bugs in the system. They\\'re going to pay them directly in computer time. When they come into C-Cubed, they learn Fortran, they learn Lisp, they learn machine language for the PDPs. Back at Lakeside, they were just using BASIC, the programming language.\\n\\nBen: Which is reasonably high level in terms of how abstract it is. You\\'re not writing machine language. You don\\'t have to know how to address memory, registers, and all that. It reads English, it knows how to add numbers together. It\\'s not an elegant language, and it\\'s a very verbose language. But if you look at it with your eyes as a person who speaks English and knows basic math, you\\'re like, I understand what this program does. There\\'s a meaningful amount of translation done by a BASIC interpreter that takes you from the BASIC code you have to write to what is actually running on the machine.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, but BASIC, we don\\'t want to give the impression that it is just basic or just for kids.\\n\\nBen: No, it\\'s widely used.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s going to become hugely, hugely important. It is both the gateway programming language for everybody, but it\\'s a real programming language, and a lot of stuff is done in it.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s the Python of its day. I think the way Python is now where you joke that Python is so flexible, you can accidentally write a program by writing English, it can forgive a lot of mistakes, and it reads English, it\\'s a reasonable parallel to draw it way back when with BASIC where you say, look, you can understand it as a layman, but also it\\'s used in a broad set of business applications.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. When Bill, Paul, and their buddies come into C-Cubed, they\\'re now getting access to learn real hardcore systems programming languages, including machine code for the PDP-10. They\\'re becoming pretty prolific engineers here.\\n\\nBen: They\\'re handwriting assembly code.\\n\\nDavid: And they\\'re getting mentored. One of the executives at C-Cubed is a guy named Steve Russell. Did you find this, Ben? Do you know about this?\\n\\nBen: No.\\n\\nDavid: This is amazing. You\\'re going to die. Steve Russell was the guy who wrote Spacewar when he was at MIT on the first PDP, the PDP -1. He\\'s a computer science legend.\\n\\nBen: Nolan Bushnell told us about that.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Spacewar was the first video game, first computer game ever written. It was written as a fun side project by some MIT engineers in the early days of DEC, and then that became Nolan Bushnell\\'s inspiration for starting Atari and Pong. Steve Russell, that guy, he mentored Bill Gates.\\n\\nBen: Wow, and he was here at the University of Washington?\\n\\nDavid: He had come out to the University of Washington, and then left and was part of one of the execs starting this company.\\n\\nBen: C-Cubed, wow. That\\'s a mile from my house.\\n\\nDavid: Right? Crazy.\\n\\nBen: Wow.\\n\\nDavid: After a little while at C-Cubed, all of this real expertise that these kids are getting leads to another opportunity at another timeshare computing company based down in Portland. They ask the kids to write a real piece of software, to write a payroll billing program for all their clients that are using the timeshare system.\\n\\nBill now, who\\'s the de facto leader of this group, negotiates a deal with the help of his dad, Bill Gates Sr. prolific corporate attorney in Seattle. Rather than just being paid hourly for their time, they\\'re going to get a royalty on the revenue that their client makes off the software. I can\\'t believe it. These kids are teenagers. They\\'re figuring out the whole software business model here.\\n\\nThey end up making at least $10,000 from these royalties, which the average household income in the US at the time was below $10,000. These kids are rolling in money. The next year, Paul graduates from Lakeside and goes off to college at Washington State. He and Bill decide to team up on a new venture that they\\'re going to do together called Traf-O-Data.\\n\\nBen: They\\'ve identified a market opportunity, and that opportunity is reducing traffic.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. The business plan is that municipalities count cars that go through intersections, use that to make decisions about how they\\'re going to do city planning. Bill and Paul are like, we can take this new thing that\\'s coming out of Intel, a microprocessor, which is promising to be a full computer on one chip. We can use that. We can build a machine that is going to be a computer, and it\\'ll process and analyze that data, and then we can sell it to governments. Great, big market.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, are you sensing what\\'s happening here? Mainframe, mini computer, microprocessor. We have to keep using smaller and smaller words to represent the fact that the computer is getting smaller and smaller here.\\n\\nDavid: It wasn\\'t until we started doing research for this episode that I finally realized, oh, microcomputers, which is the original term for the personal computer for the PC. It was called microcomputers before PC caught on. They\\'re called microcomputers because they\\'re based on the microprocessor.\\n\\nBen: Yes, absolutely.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s not just that micro is smaller than mini.\\n\\nBen: It is funny that it stopped there. The computers that are sitting on all of our desks are microcomputers.\\n\\nDavid: Right. While they\\'re waiting for the AD08, this new first microprocessor from Intel, to come out, or at least for them to get access to it, they want to get a head start on programming their traffic data machine and programming this microprocessor. Paul\\'s like, I got this. I can find a way to make this happen.\\n\\nHe takes the PDP-10 at Washington State and he writes a whole emulator program to mimic the instruction set for the AD08 from the manual. They get a full emulator up and running, and they can code even without the microprocessor actually being there. It\\'s just NVIDIA. When Jensen was like, no, we got to build an emulator and simulate this, and then we\\'re going to ship it sight unseen, they\\'re doing the same thing.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s funny. In many ways, at this point in history, getting a manual was actually much more valuable than getting the processor itself because the processor would arrive. Unless there was documentation, you would have no idea how to interact with it to take advantage of its power.\\n\\nIf you had a manual, sure, you couldn\\'t actually test the stuff you wrote for it on the hardware. But if you wrote an emulator on a bigger, more powerful computer that could mimic the computer that you\\'re actually targeting, you could go years before actually ever running the software on the target device and just work off of what the manual says as long as the manual is correct and matches how it actually works.\\n\\nDavid: And this is going to become very important to Microsoft in just a second. Traffic data is not a huge success. I think I read a few places, they make about $20,000 in revenue from it. Again, great money for high school and college kids, but not world-changing stuff here. This is not what Bill aspires to for the company he\\'s going to start.\\n\\nBill and Paul are getting experience with the microprocessor. Bill actually has the idea for Microsoft when they\\'re working with it. He\\'s like, oh, this is a computer, why don\\'t I go off and write an interpreter for BASIC here, and we can sell the BASIC interpreter for the microprocessor and build a big business? The AD08 just wasn\\'t powerful enough yet to do that.\\n\\nBen: But spoiler alert, that totally becomes Microsoft. The seeds of Microsoft are selling language interpreters for new processors, new hardware, new computers that enable you to write familiar programming languages on that new hardware.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Bill and Paul are not the only ones having this insight here, too. Another Seattle guy named Gary Kildall who they had intersected with, who they knew from C-Cubed and the University of Washington, had the same idea here. We\\'re going to bring up Gary and his company, Digital Research, a little bit later.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, he cared a little bit less about programming languages and a little bit more about operating systems. That\\'s how they diverged for the few years here.\\n\\nDavid: Bill and Paul absolutely see the vision for what this can grow into and become. Bill has a great quote. \"Paul and I had talked about the microprocessor, and it was really his insight that because of semiconductor improvements, things would just keep getting better. I said to him, oh, exponential phenomena are pretty rare, pretty dramatic. Are you serious about this? Because this means, in effect, that we can think of computing as free. It was a gross exaggeration, but it was probably the easiest way to understand what it means to cut costs like that. And Paul was quite convinced of it.\"\\n\\nBen: Is this in the Smithsonian interview?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, so good.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s so good. This quote is incredible because basically, Paul Allen brings up Moore\\'s Law to Bill Gates; they don\\'t use that language there. But in 1971, that is what\\'s happening. For Paul, this is just an observation of hey, there\\'s an exponential thing happening here, it seems like it\\'s going to keep happening, it\\'s been happening.\\n\\nBill\\'s shaking and he\\'s like, what? Exponential phenomena don\\'t just happen. That\\'s incredibly, incredibly rare and immediately gets Bill\\'s wheels turning on. What does this mean for the world? If that\\'s actually true, we need to act and do something profoundly different than anyone\\'s ever done before because this enables new things that no one ever thought could be possible.\\n\\nDavid: This moment is the genesis of the vision for Microsoft. Even though Bill doesn\\'t say the words in this quote, the vision of a computer on every desk in every home, that\\'s the famous part that got left off later when the DOJ started sniffing around was running Microsoft software.\\n\\nBut that is the vision here, and it is crazy at the time. A computer on every desk and in every home, Bill sees that this is what this exponential phenomenon, what Moore\\'s law means, that that is going to happen. We\\'re still in the era of teletypes. Nobody else sees this.\\n\\nBen: And it\\'s also the reason why Microsoft is going to form into such a different type of company that\\'s ever come before it, why they can break all the rules, why they can sell just software, even though that\\'s never been a thing before, why their business model can be so much different than everyone else\\'s business model.\\n\\nIn preparing for this episode, we got to talk with Pete Higgins, who ran Excel and was an executive overseeing Office for a long time in the early days. He had this great quote to us, which was, \"Computer on every desk was wackadoo stuff. People laughed at it. It was absolutely wild. People thought, I don\\'t know, maybe 1 in 10 people in their finance group or something will have one at some point. This is the profoundness of an exponential decrease in price or increase in power of computing. It\\'s going to become universal.\"\\n\\nDavid: All that said, even Bill and Paul know the AD08. It\\'s not there yet. It\\'s not powerful enough to really be a general-purpose computer on a chip, but they know it\\'s coming. In the fall of 1973, Bill goes off to college at Harvard famously. It\\'s funny, at Harvard, like Jim Simons that we talked about at MIT on the RenTech episode. Bill thinks he\\'s going to be a world-class mathematician and set the world on fire.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s literally a quote from Paul Allen. Bill was the number one math student in the state of Washington. He gets there, and he does this theoretical math class, math 55 and gets a B. Paul says, when it came to higher mathematics, he might\\'ve been one in a hundred thousand or better, but there were people who were one in a million or one in 10 million. And some of them wound up at Harvard. Bill would never be the smartest guy in the room, and I think that hurt his motivation. He eventually switched his major to applied math.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. While Bill\\'s at Harvard, he\\'s also doing a bunch of the typical college kid stuff. He\\'s playing poker, he\\'s cutting classes, he\\'s making friends. One of the friends he makes there is a kid down the hall from him named Steve Ballmer. Everybody knows Ballmer. He\\'s everything that Bill is not. He\\'s super social, he\\'s super outgoing. He\\'s in a final club, which is a big thing in the social scene at Harvard.\\n\\nBen: He\\'s gregarious. Anyone who\\'s ever met Steve or seen a video of Steve, you are well aware that this man has a presence. But the thing that people don\\'t know about him is he is so unbelievably analytical. Steve is the guy that outscored Bill Gates on the Putnam exam.\\n\\nDavid: Which is the annual math competition for college students.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, Steve isn\\'t a programmer, but he is every bit the mathematician that Bill Gates is. That is one of these things where I think when people try to set it up as well, you\\'ve got the brilliant programmer genius and the marketing guy, it\\'s just like those are the roles they took. But I think when you\\'re getting a sense of who the original crew was at Microsoft, they were all brainiacs, and they were all wildly analytical.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. In the spring of 1974, Bill\\'s freshman year, Electronics Magazine publishes big news about a new Intel chip, the next generation, the next turn of the crank on Moore\\'s Law, the 8080. In Bill\\'s words here, all at once, we were looking at the heart of a real computer, and the price was under $200. We attacked the manual. I told Paul, DEC can\\'t sell any more PDP-8s now. It seemed obvious to us that if a tiny chip could get so much more powerful, the end of big unwieldy machines was coming.\\n\\nBen: Yup. This is really where Bill Gates commits to computers to be his life\\'s work. I think what\\'s often lost in the story is Bill, even though he was good at computers and spent tons of time programming computers, never fancied himself a computer guy until this moment in history. He went to Harvard because he felt, hey, if I ever want to be a lawyer or something else, they\\'ve got a lot of great programs there. This was the moment where I think it really clicked for him that I\\'m just in the middle of the right place at the right time with the right skill set, and this is my way of having the most impact on the world.\\n\\nDavid: They think, okay, what\\'s clearly going to happen here is all the big computer companies, IBM, DEC, the big Japanese computing companies, they see this. They\\'re going to get into this business, they\\'re going to make machines, and they\\'re going to make microcomputers. Surely, they will jump on this opportunity, right?\\n\\nBen: If it didn\\'t destroy their existing business model, sure they would.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Bill and Paul are sitting around waiting through 1974 and 1975 being like, hey, when are the 8080 computers going to come out? Where are they? It\\'s just crickets. Paul is so convinced that the revolution is coming that he actually drops out of Washington State, moves to Boston to be close to Bill so that they can be ready when it happens. That summer, they both get summer jobs at Honeywell as programmers. Paul stays on into the next school year when Bill goes back to school. He\\'s just waiting, waiting, waiting.\\n\\nIn December 1974, Paul is walking across Harvard Square, and he sees in a newsstand the January issue of Popular Electronics, on whose cover is the Altair 8800, the world\\'s first real honest-to-God commercially available for sale microcomputer. The legend has it that Paul grabs the magazine, runs over to Bill\\'s dorm, throws open the door, throws the magazine on the desk, and is like, it\\'s here. Bill\\'s just says, oh, my God, it\\'s happening without us. We need to get on this right now.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s so funny he thinks they\\'re already behind because clearly they\\'re not. History would show. I think Bill Gates even says, we might\\'ve actually started a year or two too early. The market actually hadn\\'t materialized yet. The funniest thing is, the starting gun went off, Bill and Paul ran, and everyone else is still standing around.\\n\\nDavid: This is it. This is the moment. The revolution is here. Microsoft is about to be founded. But first, this is a great time to thank our presenting partner this season, JP Morgan Payments.\\n\\nBen: Just like Bill\\'s vision of Microsoft to put a computer on every desk and in every home, JP Morgan has a vision for making payments real time, 24/7 everywhere and in every currency. JP Morgan has experienced a massive digital transformation, and is now much more than just a global bank. They invest $15 billion a year into technology and R&D. With JP Morgan Payments, you are getting their history of service, stability, and scale, but also innovation and new technology.\\n\\nDavid: Scale is really the key word here. Every episode, we talk about Hamilton Helmer\\'s seven powers, and boy, does JP Morgan have scale economies. What\\'s unique about their position in payments is that they can make massive infrastructure investments that benefit their customers in the near term, in addition to the long-term technology bets like blockchain or quantum computing. Since they move $10 trillion a day in 160 countries, these investments create a lot of shared value across their large customer base.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, not to mention the second of the Seven Powers\\' network economies.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. If you\\'re a JP Morgan payments customer, whether you\\'re a startup or a Fortune 500, you can access their payments partner network. This is a set of third party integrations across virtually every industry and payment use case. It makes it easy to discover what specific set of tools are best for your business.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s basically a B2B marketplace that connects their clients with the broader payments and technology ecosystem such as treasury management systems, ERPs, point of sale hardware solutions, payment gateways, and so much more. Given JP Morgan\\'s scale, you can imagine the value that comes with unlocking access to their industry leading partners and technology.\\n\\nDavid: Let\\'s take Visa, for example, which listeners may remember. We talked a lot on that episode about the power of a network. Visa works with JP Morgan to provide global payment processing services. Now through the partner network, you can easily add Visa as an acceptance method through a streamlined implementation with consolidated reporting. Other companies in the partner network include Oracle, American Express, MasterCard, Accenture, and many more including friends of the show, Modern Treasury.\\n\\nBen: Across any industry, the most successful companies we\\'ve talked about are the ones who think and invest strategically through a long-term lens. Like Hermes, durability and reliability are paramount for building hundred year companies that can reinvent and continue to grow. That is the case for JP Morgan Payments. Their history of trusted solutions and investments in technology bring clients and new fintech companies together to drive innovation and growth for businesses of all sizes.\\n\\nDavid: Before we jump back into Bill and Microsoft, who essentially wrote the modern playbook on building platforms, be sure to check out jpmorgan.com/acquired or click on the link in the show notes.\\n\\nBen: David, they\\'re like, it\\'s happening without us. What do they do?\\n\\nDavid: They do the natural thing that two super excited, ambitious, high octane college kids would do. They call up the main phone number of Altair\\'s manufacturer, a company called MITS and ask for the president, a man named Ed Roberts. Bill and Paul get them on the phone and they say, we have a BASIC interpreter, ready to go, ready to ship, for the 8080 Intel chip, and we want to provide it for you, for your machine.\\n\\nBen: Of course they don\\'t.\\n\\nDavid: They don\\'t have a single letter of code written. They don\\'t have anything.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s a market test. They want to know what\\'s the response if this were true.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Ed\\'s a bit of a character himself. He says, okay, well, guys, a lot of other people are calling me and saying the same thing. What I\\'m telling them, and I\\'m going to tell you too, is that anybody who can come here to my office in Albuquerque, New Mexico and demonstrate a working version of BASIC on my Altair will get a contract with us to distribute it when they go on sale. Bill and Paul say, okay, great, we\\'ll see you soon, and hang up. By ‘see you soon,’ they mean, ‘let\\'s go get to work.’\\n\\nBen: This is a big deal for MITS too if this works, because right now they\\'ve just announced a machine for which you can\\'t really do anything on it. The hardware is powerful, but they\\'re not going to have a lot of customers unless there\\'s stuff you can do on the machine. A BASIC interpreter running on it, it\\'s quite valuable to then make the claim you can program BASIC on our computer. They\\'re very excited about this, even though they\\'re playing coy.\\n\\nDavid: I was going to talk about this in a minute, but let\\'s talk about what the Altair is. What did they just announce in the magazine here? The Altair is the first mass market commercially available personal computer.\\n\\nBen: Again, no screen or anything.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Does not have a screen, does not have a keyboard, doesn\\'t have a display of any kind. What it does have is it has a set of 16 lights on the front of the machine, Christmas lights and 16 switches. You can flip the switches to flip bits, and then the machine will respond by lighting up different patterns of lights. It doesn\\'t come with any software. There\\'s nothing. That\\'s all it is, 16 lights, 16 switches.\\n\\nBen: In order to use it, you got to hook up your own teletype, you got to get the manual, you got to hope that the manual is right, and you got to code to the machine instructions, literally the assembly language for the chip inside for the Intel 8080.\\n\\nDavid: Back to the Traf-O-Data days and Paul writing the emulator for the 8008 at Washington State, Paul\\'s like, we got this. I\\'ll just write an emulator on the Harvard PDP-10 for the 8080 instruction set.\\n\\nBen: He does the same thing again. They get the manual, they have an emulator, and they write it against an emulator.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Bill writes the BASIC interpreter. In a couple of weeks, they\\'ve got it working. Ed\\'s like, okay, come on out to Albuquerque. Bill and Paul—remember, Bill still looks he\\'s 12 at this point in time—decide that just Paul should go.\\n\\nBen: Does Paul have a rocking beard at this point yet?\\n\\nDavid: Paul is super 70s. He is into it. As we\\'ll see, he\\'s going to fit right in at Albuquerque and MITS. Paul gets on a plane, flies from Boston to Albuquerque. In a total epic legend moment, they didn\\'t have a bootloader written for the BASIC interpreter.\\n\\nThey had the BASIC, it was all written, they\\'d done it on the emulator, and Paul\\'s flying out with the computer tape with the code of the BASIC interpreter on it. He\\'s like, oh, shoot, we can\\'t just feed that right into the machine. There\\'s got to be a bootloader to load up this thing. He writes the bootloader on the plane.\\n\\nBen: On paper, by hand, he is hand coding octal, not even assembly language instructions. He\\'s hand coding in pure octal the instructions to load their BASIC interpreter program into memory.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. He lands in Albuquerque, drives out to MITS. They load the bootloader onto the prototype Altair there that loads up the BASIC interpreter, and it fails. It doesn\\'t work. Paul\\'s like, oh, shoot, let\\'s try it again. Let\\'s try it again. They try it again. This is how early computing is. It works the second. Who knows what the bug was the first time. They didn\\'t change anything, it just didn\\'t work the first time, and it worked the second time.\\n\\nIt loads up, Paul writes in the instructions, print two plus two. It spits out four—by spits out, I mean the lights light up and say four. Both he and Ed, their jaws are on the floor. Paul\\'s like, oh, my God, the BASIC works. Ed\\'s like, oh, my God, the Altair works. Neither of them believed this was actually going to work.\\n\\nBen: Ed actually has more eggs in this basket than he let on because when Bill and Paul call and say, hey, can you give us the teletype instructions, he reveals they\\'re actually the only ones who called about that. Everyone else who said they were writing a BASIC never got far enough to ask, how do we actually interact with your computer?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Now is the time to say a few words about Ed and MITS. What is this company? Bill and Paul originally thought that it was going to be the IBMs, the DECs, the Japanese companies who are going to make the first microcomputers. MITS is about as far away from IBM as you can possibly imagine. MITS basically was a model rocket company.\\n\\nBen: Which, Albuquerque is a great place to do that.\\n\\nDavid: Ed Roberts, the founder, had been in the Air Force and stationed in Albuquerque. That\\'s how he got involved in model rocketry. The reason that they\\'re introducing the Altair and they made this big Splash in the magazine was this is a last ditch gambit to try and save the company. You got a bankrupt model rocketry company.\\n\\nBen: Their little gambit worked and got a couple of college kids to pounce.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Why did it work? They had two things going for them that really, Ed, I think probably personally made happen. (1) They got this splashy popular electronics magazine cover that was through a relationship that Ed had. (2) The sticker price was $397, which is about $2300 in 2024 dollars. Yes, that\\'s a lot of money, but the next cheapest computer that anybody could buy at this point in time was a DEC, a $120,000 mini computer. The idea that somebody could buy a computer for $400, I don\\'t care who\\'s selling that thing, I want that.\\n\\nBen: What did they get, some sweet deal from Intel?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This is all Ed\\'s doing. The list price from Intel for the 8080 chip was $360. I think this is part of what was deterring the market of how would anybody sell a kit that was affordably priced when so much of the cost of goods would go to Intel with the processor deal. He managed to negotiate a volume deal with Intel to get 8080 chips at $75 a pop. That was the key unlock.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s a 5X price reduction.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I wasn\\'t able to find how that negotiation went down or why Ed Roberts in Albuquerque, New Mexico got this sweetheart deal from Intel.\\n\\nBen: Either the list price is wildly wrong, or they were cutting deals all over the place. One thing it could have been is just that, and I\\'m totally speculating, but chips are the ultimate high fixed cost investment, low marginal costs next to software.\\n\\nYou could imagine maybe Intel had already put all the money into the fixed costs of spinning up the fabs and was expecting a certain amount of market demand, and they weren\\'t seeing it. They were like, crap, we\\'ve got to recoup our investment. I don\\'t know, lower the price, let them just sell. Maybe we\\'ll make it up in volume.\\n\\nDavid: I like that. I have no idea, but that\\'s a totally viable train of thought here. Either way, he gets the sweetheart deal. Not only does it make computer history and enable and create Microsoft, it saves the company of MITS.\\n\\nThey were on the edge of bankruptcy. After the popular electronics article comes out, they get 4000 pre-orders in the first month or two, which is $1.5 million in revenue, cash paid upfront. That is pure cash hitting the bank account.\\n\\nBen: That will save a company.\\n\\nDavid: And also just proves 4000 people just paid cash sight unseen for 16 lights and switches. There\\'s a lot of demand for a home computer here.\\n\\nBen: At decent margins too, if they\\'re getting the processor for $72, and they\\'re selling it for what did you say?\\n\\nDavid: $397.\\n\\nBen: Everything else in there is much cheaper than the processor, so I don\\'t know. Depending on how much they have to give to the sales channel they\\'re selling through, if it\\'s retail or distributors.\\n\\nDavid: I think they\\'re selling direct. I think people are just sending money orders.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s a decent margin business. Unlike what the PC business would become over time, they managed to have nice margins.\\n\\nDavid: Paul and Ed hit it off. Paul decides to move out to Albuquerque to be close to the action here. He actually joins MITS as their vice president of Software. He\\'s vice president of a software department of one. He is the software department here.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, software department of one, but he\\'s got his buddy Bill Gates who is not employed, but Bill\\'s definitely working on software for the Altar as well.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Bill stays at Harvard, but keeps cranking on enhancing the BASIC interpreter and adding more functions and functionality to the version of BASIC that they had just written for the Altair. Once the school year is over, he comes out to Albuquerque for the summer.\\n\\nThe Altair is getting ready to ship with the Microsoft BASIC included in it. Bill and Paul need to set up a company, but Paul is an employee of MITS at this point, so what did they do? They set up a partnership. The founding of Microsoft, at this point Micro-Soft, is a two-person partnership between Bill and Paul.\\n\\nBen: As we record this, that was 49 years and one day ago. We are sitting here on April 5th recording. That was April 4th, 1975. It is very funny to look back at some of the original signatures when Bill writes on letters. It\\'s Bill Gates, the general partner of Micro-Soft, which is great. I think it\\'s actually a Paul Allen name where he wants to put together microcomputer and software. Bill\\'s like, that\\'s perfect, we\\'re immediately just going to run with it. As it was a partnership, originally, they were going to call it something like Allen and Gates, and then they ultimately are like, no, Micro-Soft is perfect.\\n\\nDavid: Microsoft has become Kleenex. Microsoft means microprocessor software.\\n\\nBen: I will say it\\'s a nice clarifying North Star because it really draws the line in the sand and says, we\\'re in the software business. Gates makes this really clear to Paul Allen, who is often tempted to do hardware stuff. Bill is very hardcore about saying, no, what we\\'re uniquely good at in the world is software and we should stick to that.\\n\\nI also suspect Bill is starting to realize that there\\'s an amazing business model here if we can pull it off, where we don\\'t have to make the hardware, and we can charge for every copy of the software sold. But that insight, I would say, has not yet fully materialized.\\n\\nDavid: Let\\'s talk about business model here in one sec. First though on the partnership. Again, we\\'ve been saying all along that Bill is clearly the leader here. They set up the partnership. Initially, it\\'s 60/40 ownership, Bill is 60%, Paul is 40%. Later, it gets changed to Bill is 64% and Paul is 36%. Yup, Bill is the leader here.\\n\\nBen: Bill\\'s case that he makes on that to Paul is, hey, you took a job and you were doing this on the side, I was all in. Paul\\'s an agreeable guy, and 36% is still a nice percent, so he says, sure.\\n\\nDavid: In the long run here, everybody gets nuts. It\\'s all a rounding error, but to that point back to the business model. Once the partnership is set up, they sign an exclusive licensing arrangement with MITS. This is super important. This is a big lesson that young Bill and Paul are going to learn here.\\n\\nMITS gets exclusive license to the BASIC interpreter to the BASIC as they call it for the 8080. MITS is the one that can then decide whether to sublicense the BASIC out to other companies or not.\\n\\nEssentially, this is a distribution deal with MITS, where MITS becomes the exclusive seller and distributor of Microsoft\\'s BASIC. Microsoft doesn\\'t have any direct sales control here, and it\\'s going to become a big, big, big issue. The terms of the deal are Microsoft is to get $30 for each copy of BASIC that MITS sells plus 50% of the revenue that comes from the sublicensing deals that MITS may or may not do with other companies who want to use the BASIC.\\n\\nBen: Why would they ever do any sublicensing deals? Why would you give it to your competitors?\\n\\nDavid: That is a really good question, Ben.\\n\\nBen: Let\\'s just round that part of the revenue to zero.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. This is a big, big, big divergence of interest between Microsoft and MITS. The kicker on this contract is that the total amount of lifetime revenue that Microsoft can make from the BASIC from MITS is capped at $180,000. Ed admits really has the upper hand in this deal.\\n\\nBen: Or phrased another way, we will give you $180,000 for you to hand over exclusive rights to all that cool BASIC stuff you just wrote to us. But if we sell fewer than X machines, we\\'re actually going to pay it out to you on a prorated basis at $30 a pop rather than giving you the full $180,000.\\n\\nDavid: That is another way to frame it. Definitely, a great deal for MITS. On the other hand, what are Bill and Paul going to do here?\\n\\nBen: Right, a great deal for them too given the position they\\'re in.\\n\\nDavid: Right, MITS is the industry. There is one very, very important clause in the contract though, protecting Microsoft\\'s interests. That clause is that MITS must use its best efforts to license, promote, and commercialize the BASIC broadly in the marketplace. Any failure to do so by MITS would be grounds for termination of the contract by Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: Thank God, Bill\\'s dad is a lawyer.\\n\\nDavid: Indeed. The Altair comes out for sale later in 1975. Microsoft does $16,000 in revenue that year from their $30 a pop, the BASICs that are getting sold with the Altair, which is great, especially the first year that they\\'re starting.\\n\\nThe next year in 1976, everybody\\'s so excited about this new market, the vision that\\'s happening, the demand, the Altair, the sales that Paul Allen resigns from MITS to join Microsoft full-time. Bill drops out of Harvard officially. He moves to Albuquerque. They\\'re all in on this. But for the year in 1976, Microsoft\\'s revenue is still only $22,000. It was $16,000 the year before, $22,000 in 1976.\\n\\nBen: Not a high growth company.\\n\\nDavid: This is less than they were making in high school. What is going on here? (1) MITS is the one at the controls of sales, not Microsoft. (2) MITS is selling a thousand computers a month. This is taking off. This is creating a new industry. Despite MITS selling thousands of computers a month, only a few hundred copies of BASIC are selling per month. What\\'s going on? People are pirating the software. This is the discovery of software piracy.\\n\\nBen: This is a pretty interesting time to pause and say, are they pirating software?\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s a good question.\\n\\nBen: This is 1975. Piracy implies that you are running afoul of some particular legal protection for the good. You might say, well, with today\\'s legal frameworks in hindsight, you would say, of course, if they\\'re copying the software and not paying the money for it, it\\'s piracy. That was actually not established yet. This is the craziest thing. Bill basically has an opinion that it\\'s piracy, and he writes letters to the computer community.\\n\\nDavid: He writes an open letter to hobbyists.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and tries to basically guilt trip people. He tries to use that as a recruiting method and say, if you\\'re so excited about pirating our software, maybe you should just come work with us. Nothing would make me happier than making the best software in the world, and please join us on this mission. But ultimately, the legal standing that he has to say, hey, what you\\'re doing is illegal, is not fully established.\\n\\nIt would actually take a couple of years for the courts to look at software and say, what about this is protectable? If you think about it, it is a little bit weird. You\\'ve got source code that looks like English, BASIC, it\\'s letters and numbers. It gets translated to machine code. That machine code ends up running, and it\\'s basically electrons. It\\'s voltages that are flipped up and down. What about that are we trying to protect?\\n\\nUltimately, the way it gets litigated through some case law from court cases is that the source code is a copyrightable, creative work that is expressed through some tangible medium. That\\'s the important thing about copyright law. It\\'s a creative work expressed through a tangible medium. A book, the creative work is the words and the tangible medium is printed on paper.\\n\\nWith software, it actually took until 1980. Congress changed the law. We\\'ll put a link in the show notes to the literal congressional change that happened. It is in Title 17, Copyrights Chapter 1, Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright. In 1980, they include a defined term, which is a \"computer program is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.” Once you have that passed by Congress codified into law, you now have the standing legal framework that all the whole computer industry used going forward, in particular, the software industry, a computer program is copyrightable work.\\n\\nDavid: Wow, I didn\\'t know all, that\\'s awesome.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s totally crazy how recent that is. But when you think about it, why would that have any legal…? Software is such an abstract idea. Before, the whole business model of computers was good luck just replicating an IBM PC and everything that comes with it. You don\\'t need any legal standing. But if you\\'re going to pursue this software only business model, what\\'s the protection around your abstract product?\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s exactly what I was going to say here. This is the other element of what\\'s going on. This is the first time software has ever been sold. Other than the IBM accounting machinations to protect themselves from antitrust, which was just accounting, nobody had ever sold software before. This is the first time.\\n\\nBen: Certainly to build a legitimate business around it. The other thing that\\'s useful to know is when you\\'re selling an IBM PC, you\\'re literally selling a PC to a customer the same way that when I\\'m selling you this glass. From crate and barrel, I am selling you the glass, and the glass is now yours. I\\'ve transferred property to you.\\n\\nSoftware is not that, so the whole world of software is built on a license agreement. The source code that computer program the actual right of that is retained by the creator, and you license the copyright to your customer to be able to use that on their machine.\\n\\nThere\\'s this dual idea that computer software is copyrightable, and you can grant a license under certain conditions for customers to use it. That is the legal framework for which the next 50 years of technology at large would operate under.\\n\\nDavid: For the moment though...\\n\\nBen: They have a piracy problem.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The law isn\\'t going to change until 1980. Microsoft would be dead if they didn\\'t figure out a solution to this before 1980. This is when Bill ultimately realizes, shoot, we did the wrong business deal with MITS here. MITS has to sell, and customers have to make the decision buy our BASIC. It\\'s a key critical part of the value of the computer. It\\'s the whole thing.\\n\\nBen: It makes that machine useful.\\n\\nDavid: Without it, it is not useful. It\\'s totally setting up the wrong incentives and value equation that customers should be buying this themselves. It should be included by the hardware OEM in the machine that they are selling and in the total purchase price. If that happens, We no longer have a piracy problem because we\\'re just getting paid as part of the purchase of the machine.\\n\\nBen: Right, it should be a royalty.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The problem is that is not the deal that they had with MITS.\\n\\nBen: Right, or framed differently. Instead of saying, hey, consumer, do you want to buy something else too and make a new purchase decision, they should be saying, hey computer manufacturer, we make your thing actually useful, so pay us for it.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. During 1975 and 1976, MITS pretty much had this new microcomputer market all to themselves. There were a couple of other competitors who sprung up, but nothing made. The Altair and MITS was the microcomputer company.\\n\\nAll that changes, though, in a big way in 1977, when what Byte Magazine calls the 1977 Trinity hits the market. That is three machines, the Tandy/RadioShack TRS-80, the Commodore Personal Electronic Transactor, or the acronym PET, and the Apple II. All three of which machines were like the Altair, low cost, mass market.\\n\\nUnlike the Altair, they were not kits. They were fully assembled, fully functional, right out of the box, and they each had their own major distribution advantages. In Bill\\'s words, these three machines, the 1977 Trinity, ignite volume in the market. Bill loves these really dramatic verbs like we attacked the manual, they ignite the volume in the market.\\n\\nBen: The press just latches on to him. Whenever Bill has a leaked memo or something where he talks about all this war terminology, those all become headlines.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s so great. Earlier, during 1976, Microsoft had started getting approached by a few of the bigger computing companies NCR (National Cash Register), GE, Control Data Systems. I want to license Microsoft BASIC for the 8080 microprocessor here so that we can experiment with these things. Each of these deals would have been revenue to Microsoft of $100,000-ish.\\n\\nEd and MITS, they keep dragging their feet on negotiating these. They\\'ve got the exclusive license. Everything\\'s got to go through MITS. Most of them are turning down because Ben, you said, they don\\'t want anybody to come in and compete with them.\\n\\nBen: Yup, there\\'s the misaligned incentive.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s the misaligned incentive. There is the clause that Bill and Microsoft, and I presume Bill Sr. put in the original agreement—is MITS is using its best efforts to commercialize the BASIC and gain adoption in the market? You can make a pretty strong argument that they\\'re not.\\n\\nEd, though, unbeknownst to Bill and Paul, has another reason that he\\'s dragging his feet on these deals, which is that he\\'s about to sell the company. In May of 1977, MITS gets acquired by the tape drive manufacturer, Pertec, for $6.5 million. Ed rides off into the sunset.\\n\\nPertec knows about this dispute with Microsoft, and they come in and they figure, who is this Bill Gates? He\\'s a 21-year-old kid, a college dropout, we\\'re a big company, we can deal with this. Robert says an amazing quote later. He says, \"Pertec kept telling me they could deal with this kid. It was a little Roosevelt telling Churchill that he could deal with Stalin.\"\\n\\nBen: Oh, my God.\\n\\nDavid: I also don\\'t think they realized that this kid\\'s dad is one of the best corporate attorneys in the country.\\n\\nBen: Bill Gates was just constantly underestimated, which worked to his advantage in those early days.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: This is the thing about Microsoft. People forget how insanely young Bill was. He was just 20. To put that in context, he\\'s only 7 years older than Jensen Huang, but they feel an entire generation apart since Microsoft was started almost 20 years before NVIDIA. When you start bending your mind around like, oh, Bill Gates is still pretty young, considering what an institution Microsoft has become in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Microsoft next year is going to have its 50th anniversary. I believe that\\'ll also be the same year that Bill turns 70. That\\'s wild.\\n\\nBen: Yeah.\\n\\nDavid: That fall in 1977. The dispute between MITS/Pertec and Microsoft goes to arbitration in Albuquerque. The interim months while this arbitration is happening are the only moment in Microsoft\\'s history where cash gets tight. They\\'re running out of money because they can\\'t really make any sales here.\\n\\nBen: They don\\'t control their destiny.\\n\\nDavid: People aren\\'t paying MITS for the BASIC. They\\'re \"pirating\" the software. They can\\'t do deals with all the other computer companies that want to come licensed directly, so things get a little tight. Microsoft ends up winning the arbitration, I believe, in maybe November 1977, meaning they are now totally free to license BASIC to anybody who wants to buy it on any terms that they want.\\n\\nThey turn around. They immediately license it to Trinity, Apple, Commodore, Radio Shack, and Tandy. They license it to all the big companies, the GEs, the NCRs, who want to experiment with microcomputers.\\n\\nThere\\'s a really funny story with Apple that apparently, Woz had more or less written 95% of their own BASIC. But it didn\\'t have floating point numbers, it only had integer numbers. Jobs is totally writing Woz. He\\'s like, the BASIC is really important. Can you just finish it? Can you do floating point? Woz just doesn\\'t do it, so Jobs has to go license Microsoft\\'s BASIC. Amazing.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s the first deal that happens between the companies. There\\'s so many deals done, both directions, commercial deals, equity deals, legal disputes in both directions. This is the very first time that they do something together.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Bill, Paul, and Microsoft, do all these deals. They do them all as cash upfront, fixed cost, all you companies, you\\'re going to pay us. You include the BASIC in the machines that you\\'re selling, and we\\'re going to get all the money up front. Super presciently, though, Bill does not value maximize on these deals.\\n\\nThe Apple deal is $31,000 for eight years of access for Apple for the Apple II Microsoft\\'s BASIC. They\\'re not price gouging here because Bill sees, he\\'s like, the play here is we want to make it a no brainer for everybody who\\'s selling a microcomputer to have Microsoft\\'s BASIC on it, because we want to set the standard.\\n\\nIf we are the standard programming environment that anybody who\\'s using these computers—and again, anybody who is using these computers is programming them, they\\'re used to the Microsoft version of BASIC—we\\'re going to have so much power that it\\'ll become a self-fulfilling prophecy. All of our competitors will just wither away. Nobody will want them because it\\'s not going to be compatible with the language everybody knows. Once people start trading and then ultimately developing and selling software that they\\'ve written, it\\'s only going to run on our BASIC interpreter, not anybody else\\'s.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating. I actually didn\\'t know that it started this early. One correction there, you don\\'t know for a fact it\\'s only going to run on Microsoft\\'s BASIC interpreter, but you do know for a fact that it will run on Microsoft\\'s BASIC interpreter. If it\\'s cheap enough, why would you take the chance on a clone that might have one or two things wrong with it?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Basically, his vision is, I want to remove any oxygen from any argument anyone could have about not using Microsoft\\'s BASIC on a microcomputer. He thinks about this concept as a positive spiral that he really in his mind is the reason for Microsoft\\'s success.\\n\\nHe says, “Success reinforces success. In a growing market, one way of doing something gets a slight advantage over its competitors, this is most likely to happen with high technology products that can be made in great volume for a very little increase in cost.” If you get that slight advantage, it\\'ll compound, and this is what he\\'s playing for here.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s interesting. In the earliest days, what was stopping someone else from writing a BASIC interpreter and licensing it to Apple or RadioShack? Nothing. There were other smart people out there. It was just a very good business decision to say, we got to close that door. We just got to make this a no-brainer for people to buy from us, because if we\\'re value maximizing and it\\'s starting to feel expensive, they\\'re going to turn elsewhere until we get a lead.\\n\\nDavid: The Apple story is the perfect example. The Woz thing is cute, it makes for a good story, and oh, he didn\\'t finish the BASIC. But when Microsoft sold them the BASIC, which was already getting established as the standard for $31,000...\\n\\nBen: Sure. Why not?\\n\\nDavid: No brainer. Apple could have gone out and hired another programmer to finish the BASIC. They\\'re like, wait, we could do that, or I could just get the standard one for $31,000. I\\'m going to do that.\\n\\nBen: Just because it\\'s important to establish there are trade offs for everything, if you\\'re running a startup right now, you might think to yourself, oh, great. I\\'ll just run that exact strategy. The important thing here is (a) Most of the work was already done for the original BASIC. (b) Bill was doing it himself, Bill and Paul, so the importance of technical co-founders. Their overhead was crazy low.\\n\\nThey could do these deals where they don\\'t make very much money. I think at the end of 1977, there were five employees. Their overhead was just so unbelievably low that they could take a really long lens.\\n\\nDavid: Even though it takes until the very end of 1977 when the MITS dispute gets resolved and Microsoft can actually make money again, they end 1977 with $381,000 in revenue, despite zero for the first 11 months of the year. They\\'re just rolling in cash. This is when Bill famously goes out and buys a green Porsche 911 and is motoring around Albuquerque, getting all sorts of speeding tickets and hilarious stuff.\\n\\nBen: This is when he got his mugshot, right?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I think that\\'s right.\\n\\nBen: This is the classic Bill Gates holding up the...\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Amazing.\\n\\nBen: He got, I think, three speeding tickets in one day, two of which were from the same police officer.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and there are funny stories of the Albuquerque police thought, how is a kid driving a Porsche 911? He must be a drug dealer or something.\\n\\nBen: Even when he was 20–21, he looked 17.\\n\\nDavid: Right. It\\'s like, do you even have a driver\\'s license?\\n\\nBen: Wild.\\n\\nDavid: Back to what you\\'re saying, it\\'s a really, really important point. To make this dynamic work, you need to be able to afford the investment in the fixed cost for the software, for the technology to make it that little bit superior, like Bill\\'s talking about, the slight advantage over the competitors. At this moment in time, the industry is completely brand new. The software industry is brand new.\\n\\nThe amount that that fixed costs takes, the cost is quite low. Really, it\\'s just Bill and Paul\\'s time and dedication to this industry that nobody else is making that investment. You can\\'t run this playbook today because in any market, even a brand new market, even a speculative market, the minimum viable fixed cost is billions of dollars.\\n\\nBen: Right. Yeah, that\\'s interesting. I also think this moment galvanized something important, which is Bill and Paul could look around and see that there is going to be so much value created by microcomputers and by software. They really found religion around software is magic. The things that people can create now that we\\'ve done this BASIC interpreter and these machines are cheap and plentiful. The magic will take care of itself as long as we ensure this industry can just exist and do its thing.\\n\\nThey flipped from this mode of we need to bite and scratch and claw, and make sure that we win in deals to, huh, how can we enable software as a thing to thrive? I\\'m sure we can position ourselves well to capture some or a lot of that. I think they became almost stewards of the software industry and evangelists from this point forward.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. They also do another really prescient thing the next year in 1978, which is they go global.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Nobody else is going global yet, and the way that this happens is so fun. Bill gets a call one day.\\n\\nBen: Also, how crazy is it? You\\'ve got five people, you\\'re operating out of Albuquerque, you just finally expanded from having one customer, and you\\'re like, you know what we should do this year? Let\\'s open in Japan and become an international company.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. The way this happens is one day, Bill gets a call from a guy named Kazuhiko Nishi, or Kay Nishi, who\\'s a computer enthusiast in Japan, has gotten a hold of Microsoft BASIC, and totally shares the same vision as Bill and Paul. He doesn\\'t have a Paul nor is he technical himself.\\n\\nHe\\'s like, I\\'m going to bring you guys to Japan. I\\'m going to bring you to all the big computer companies. They agree that Kay will become Microsoft\\'s exclusive distribution partner in Japan. By the next year in 1979, half of Microsoft\\'s revenue is coming from Japan, which is wild.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s unbelievable, and it stayed at that very high run rate of an international being a huge chunk, close to half always basically forever. This is a huge cornerstone of Microsoft\\'s success that they were an international company from year three of their existence.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Revenue in 1977, that last month of revenue was almost $400,000. 1978 revenue is $1.3 million.\\n\\nBen: They have 13 employees at this point.\\n\\nDavid: In 1979, revenue is $2.4 million. At the end of that year, they\\'re like, all right, we got to get out of Albuquerque.\\n\\nBen: They\\'ve got 25 employees, I believe, at that point.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, something like that. This is when they moved to Seattle. It\\'s interesting to hear Bill talk about this. He actually really liked Albuquerque. Specifically, there weren\\'t any distractions there.\\n\\nBen: No distractions, weather was great.\\n\\nDavid: Everybody was happy there, but the big problem was recruiting. He\\'s like, if we\\'re going to build this into the opportunity that I see, the vision that I see and that Paul shares with me, there\\'s no way we\\'re going to do that in Albuquerque. We got to move to a hub.\\n\\nBen: He\\'s got three reasons for why Seattle in particular. By the way, it worked. Every single person except for his secretary did make the move. (1) He grew up in Seattle. He\\'s like, I just want to go home. He justifies it in two other ways, which I found pretty fascinating. This is from an interview in the early 90s that he did.\\n\\nHe said it basically came down to Seattle or Silicon Valley. In Silicon Valley, it\\'s hard to keep secrets because there\\'s a rumor mill. In Seattle, we can be a little bit more removed, and we can announce things when we want to announce them.\\n\\n(2) In Silicon Valley, people switch around companies. I don\\'t want that. I want people to just work at Microsoft. There was a disadvantage to not being able to recruit from your competitors, but for a while, they were really the only game in town in Seattle.\\n\\nDavid: But not really, though, because pretty quickly, Microsoft is such an important part of the industry. They recruit from Silicon Valley, too. We\\'re going to talk about some of the people who come up. You\\'re totally right, people stay at Microsoft. They don\\'t leave. This continues right through to this day.\\n\\nThe other thing that I think is really important to say that makes it work for Seattle in a way that I don\\'t know that this could have worked in too many other places in the country is the University of Washington. The computer science department there was really good. There were great people. Steve Russell had come out there. There was real talent, and they were churning out graduates out of the U-Dub that would go on to populate Microsoft for decades to come.\\n\\nBen: Bill, of course, reinvested in that flywheel, donating tons of money to the university. There are buildings, there are whole new schools.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, absolutely. They played right into it.\\n\\nBen: Today, it\\'s always a top 10, if not top 5 computer science program in the country. But unlike other top computer science programs, it\\'s a state school, so it just has huge volumes. I think more students come out of the University of Washington and go to big tech than any other program in the country. That has stayed this amazing advantage.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I think the only thing even close to it is Berkeley in the Bay Area with a lot of the same dynamics. But there\\'s Stanford there too, so it\\'s a dual university system in the Bay Area. You cannot overstate how important the University of Washington was to this decision and an ultimate success of coming to Seattle.\\n\\nThis brings us to 1980 in the beginning of the year when they move to Seattle, just in time for, I think you can make a very strong argument, the single most important deal ever done in the history of technology. It\\'s crazy to even say it now, the Microsoft-IBM PC partnership.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s crazy. You have this absolute behemoth partnering with someone that\\'s not really relevant. If you\\'re standing here today, it sounds like I\\'m talking about Microsoft partnering with IBM. At the time, it was IBM partnering with Microsoft. It was the only computer company that mattered in the entire world, got themselves into a particular situation where they came to Microsoft looking for help. It\\'s the craziest set of events that made this possible, and I can\\'t wait to dive into it.\\n\\nDavid: Me too. Before we do, this is the perfect time to talk about another one of our favorite enterprise software platforms, ServiceNow, who is one of our big partners here in Season 14.\\n\\nBen: ServiceNow is the AI platform for your enterprise, helping automate processes, improve service delivery, and increase efficiency. Over 85% of the Fortune 500 runs on them, and they have quickly joined the Microsofts and the NVIDIAs as one of the most important enterprise technology vendors in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Just like those companies, ServiceNow has AI baked in everywhere in their platform, and they\\'re also a major partner of both Microsoft and NVIDIA. I was at NVIDIA\\'s GTC last week, which, by the way, was insane. I felt like a VIP at a Taylor Swift concert, it was crazy. Jensen brought up ServiceNow and their partnership many times throughout the keynote.\\n\\nWhy is ServiceNow so important both to NVIDIA and to Microsoft? AI in the real world is only as good as the bedrock platform infrastructure it runs on. For enterprises around the world, ServiceNow manages that infrastructure.\\n\\nAll the AI applications for enterprises, whether that\\'s supercharging developers with generative AI, empowering and streamlining customer service, allowing HR to deliver better employee experiences, ServiceNow has already done the hard technical work to make rolling them out not just possible, but easy and fast.\\n\\nBen: Employees can get answers quickly with smarter self-service like changing 401(k) contributions directly through AI powered chat, or developers can build apps faster with AI powered code generation, and service agents can use AI to notify you that someone\\'s product needs replacing before they even chat with you about it. With the ServiceNow platform, your business is 100% ready for AI. Simply turn it on, and it all works.\\n\\nDavid: They\\'ve built AI directly into their platform, so all the integration work to prepare for it that otherwise would have taken you years is already done. If you want to learn more about the ServiceNow platform and how it can turbocharge the time to deploy AI for your business, go on over to servicenow.com/acquired. When you get in touch, just tell them that Ben and David sent you.\\n\\nThe IBM PC. Why is IBM getting into the personal computer here in 1980? A fun quote we heard in our research was that IBM was the sun, the moon, the stars of the computing industry. That meant the hardcore enterprise mainframe computing industry.\\n\\nBen: David, are you going to attribute that quote or are you going to leave listeners just hanging?\\n\\nDavid: All right, I think it\\'s time. We talked to probably 10 early Microsoft people in research and preparation. One of those folks was Steve Ballmer himself. He used those words in describing IBM.\\n\\nBen: And it\\'s hard to imagine a better person to get their perspective on what IBM meant to the world at this point in time, because 1980 was also the year that Steve joined Microsoft. Literally at the same time in 1980, you\\'ve got the management team coming together with Steve, Bill, and Paul Allen, and you\\'ve got the IBM thing going on, and you\\'ve got them moving to Seattle. We haven\\'t even talked about Charles Simonyi yet, but this was the year he joined.\\n\\nDavid: This is the year. Every year for Microsoft until this point is the year, but 1980 is big.\\n\\nBen: Okay, so why is IBM the sun, the moon, and the stars of computing? Why are they getting into this PC? It\\'s way cheaper than anything else they sell. It seems to be a totally different business strategy, a different customer set. What\\'s going on?\\n\\nDavid: All the early microcomputers we were just talking about, the Altair, the Apple II, the TRS-80, are all 8-bit machines. They\\'re running the Intel 8080 processor or a competitor making a similar 8-bit processor. The problem with an 8-bit processor is that the maximum data size for a given instruction cycle in the processor—this is called a data word in computer science terminology—is 256, 28. You can\\'t represent any number greater than 256 in any given CPU clock cycle in an 8-bit machine.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s effectively a bandwidth limitation, where if you\\'re in a single clock cycle trying to do some particular instruction, it\\'s a very, very small amount of data that you can move through the arithmetic logic unit or that you can move through the processor in that clock cycle.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. You could think of it as an hourglass or something. There\\'s all the data sitting there in memory at the top of the hourglass, and then there\\'s this small little funnel that it goes through. That\\'s the processor, and then it comes out.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s a good analogy. It\\'s going to take forever.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, into the application of the software that the user sees. You just are not really going to process it that fast.\\n\\nBen: Very primitive machines.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. For a company IBM, they eclipsed the 8-bit computing cycle a long, long, long time ago. Mainframes, even minicomputers with DEC, all these machines are at least 16-bit, if not 32-bit computing machines. 8-bit is just not interesting.\\n\\nBen: Which is why they only cost $375 or whatever for an Altair.\\n\\nDavid: Right. In late 1979, Intel announces that they\\'re coming out with the 8086 processor, which is a 16-bit microprocessor. With 16 bits, you can really start to do some damage here in terms of the applications that you could put on this thing to eat into business software use cases.\\n\\nBen: In 16 bits, you can represent numbers up to 65,536, so that\\'s two to the 16th. You can do interesting things passing 16 bits around at once.\\n\\nDavid: There are some really, really fun aspects to this. If you look at pictures of these processors, what did the 8080, the 8-bit processor look like? And then you look at what the 8086, the 16-bit processor, looked like? You can see this.\\n\\nIn the 8008 processor that\\'s only eight bits, you see only nine pins coming off of the little chip. There\\'s the eight pins for the data bits, and then I think there\\'s one more control pin. If you look at the 8086 processor, it\\'s a much longer rectangle with 16, 17, maybe 20 pins coming off of it. You see this physically represented in the chip.\\n\\nBen: The further we get in the computing world, the more abstract stuff becomes. It\\'s always fun to go back in history when these concepts were so grounded in our physical reality that\\'s easily observable since everything was so much bigger too.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Back in 1980, the 8086 has been announced, 16-bit microprocessor is coming. IBM has already lived through missing a computing expansion era once with DEC and the minicomputer. They just let DEC take that market. Of course, that didn\\'t really hurt IBM, but man, it would have been nice to also have that market too.\\n\\nBen: The thing that they\\'re observing about the microcomputer market is it\\'s exploding. People in our industry know about DEC, people in the broader world never knew about DEC. But I think it\\'s a very different rate of adoption and rate of demand with microcomputers where IBM started to look at and go, oh, this might be a really big computer market for people.\\n\\nDavid: They\\'re finally observing the same thing that Bill and Paul did all the way back in the Traf-O-Date days of this is an exponential cycle. Moore\\'s law, this is exponential, and exponential gets real big very quickly once you get a few years in.\\n\\nBen: Yup.\\n\\nDavid: The mini computer cycle never was that. It\\'s hard to remember today, but just to underscore this again, in 1980, IBM was the most valuable company in the entire world, the highest market cap company, bigger than all the oil companies in 1980.\\n\\nBen: The sun, the moon, and the stars.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Do you know what their market capital was?\\n\\nBen: In 1980, $150 billion?\\n\\nDavid: You are almost an order of magnitude off $34 billion. That was the most valuable company. It is wild what a different world we live in today.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, even inflation adjusted, it\\'s interesting that the rate of growth of the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap has far outpaced inflation.\\n\\nDavid: That company, the most valuable in the world, they\\'re going to tiny little Microsoft that\\'s just moved to Seattle for this partnership. What\\'s going on here? This is just so amazing. They deserve so much credit here. They got the Clay Christensen disrupt yourself, disruptive technology thing intuitively decades before Clay writes any of this stuff.\\n\\nThe way that they decide to compete is all the things that Clay wrote about are working against us here. What we need to do is we need to create essentially a skunk works division, just our Lockheed episode. We need to do something outside the company, completely removed from the politics, sure, but the business incentives not to disrupt ourselves, and create a new division they called the entry level systems division. Actually, it may have existed before, but they repurpose it.\\n\\nBen: This is in Boca Raton?\\n\\nDavid: In Boca Raton, Florida. Very nice place. We were just there a couple of months ago, but not a technology hotbed in the world. They create a secret project called Project Chess, secret from the rest of the company, the whole world. The goal is to develop the IBM microcomputer or the personal computer, as people are starting to refer to microcomputers.\\n\\nThis is wild. They\\'re going to do it in secret with a small team with no other IBM resources. That means this small team, the only way they can do it is to use all off-the-shelf components from technology providers, basically play on the same level playing field as all the other microcomputer manufacturers out there.\\n\\nOne more thing, IBM leadership tells this team in Boca, they have to ship the PC to customers within one year.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s a crazy constraint.\\n\\nDavid: It is a total crazy constraint. A couple of quotes on this. Don Estridge, who is one of the leaders of Project Chess, would later say that the company realized that if you\\'re going to compete against people who started in a garage, obviously a reference to Apple here, you have to start in a garage yourself. Lou Gerstner, who later would take over IBM, would describe this whole Boca project as, \"The way you get an elephant to tap dance.\"\\n\\nBen: The question is, are they playing from behind and thus have to adopt a flawed strategy, or is this strategy of assembling with all off-the-shelf components actually a good strategy if it works?\\n\\nDavid: Let\\'s tell the story and then come back to it.\\n\\nBen: Great.\\n\\nDavid: Okay. What do they do? The hardware aspect of this is trivial, basically. Ed Roberts could put together the hardware to sell a microcomputer and do this deal with Intel. I think IBM can do a deal with Intel, not necessarily trickier but the more important part is the software. Thanks to Bill\\'s genius strategy about be the volume player, don\\'t optimize on per unit price, set the standards out there.\\n\\nBen: They were the world\\'s leading provider of programming language interpreters, right?\\n\\nDavid: 100%. There is one game in town and one game in town only, and that is Microsoft in Bellevue, Washington at this point in time.\\n\\nBen: Now, interpreters are notably different from operating systems, but Microsoft definitely has raised the flag. Everyone could see, if I want to go buy software for my computers, broadly, they\\'re an interesting group to talk to.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Obviously, operating systems are going to become really, really big here in just a sec. Again, the 8-bit generation operating systems weren\\'t that important because people were writing their own software. The standardized software, packaged application software doesn\\'t happen until the 16-bit era and doesn\\'t really, really happen until the 16-bit era and the IBM PC. That\\'s why BASIC the interpreter is so important.\\n\\nWhat happens? IBM calls up Bill Gates. By August, 1980, the two companies are in serious talks to partner and work together on the IBM PC. We referenced Steve Ballmer a minute ago. The timing is just crazy. Steve had just joined the company in June of 1980.\\n\\nBen: He\\'s employee number 30.\\n\\nDavid: The Microsoft team of 30, which the whole company of Microsoft pivots to work on the IBM PC partnership, is bigger than the Project Chess team in Boca.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s amazing.\\n\\nDavid: Wow. Okay, Bill has just convinced Steve to drop out of business school at Stanford and come help him and Paul run the company. Microsoft at this point in time is still a partnership. Steve is the first person besides Bill and Paul to get equity in the company when he joins. It\\'s 8.5% and it\\'s a handshake deal at this point.\\n\\nBen: Bill really, really wanted to bring Steve on. He knew him from the Harvard days, knew what an asset he could be.\\n\\nDavid: He is the Yin of Bill\\'s Yang.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Frankly, 8.5%, it\\'s a big grant. Who\\'s out there running a 30-person company, and you\\'re giving away 8.5% slugs? That just doesn\\'t happen. Those are founder shares. This is really a reflection that the way that Bill thought about Steve was as a founder.\\n\\nIn fact, it created some tension with Paul Allen, where Bill asked Paul, if they could go to 5%, Paul said, sure. And then Bill actually offered him 8.5%. Paul got upset and Bill said, I\\'ll eat the 3.5%. It can come out of my share because I want him that bad.\\n\\nDavid: He\\'s the perfect person for this point in time. Bill was the only salesperson doing these OEM deals. Now they\\'re dealing with IBM. They\\'re entering the enterprise world. This needs to be a real business.\\n\\nBack to the IBM negotiations, obviously Microsoft is very interested. IBM is not just very interested in working with Microsoft. They have to work with Microsoft. They\\'re the only game in town.\\n\\nBen: Specifically, they asked Microsoft for programming languages. They\\'re like, we\\'re making this great PC, we\\'re going to need a BASIC. We think you guys are working on a COBOL. We\\'d like some COBOL.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, Fortran. Give us the whole thing. There\\'s some debate on whether it was the Microsoft side or the IBM side that really saw the vision of, hey, the 16-bit generation is going to enable real business software use cases on the personal computer, but it doesn\\'t matter. That\\'s the plan here, and that is absolutely what happens.\\n\\nThese initial discussions are for the programming language. Microsoft doesn\\'t make an operating system at this point, because in the 8-bit generation, the operating system, I think, was a glorified bootloader to just get into the programming environment so that you could either write or load up the BASIC programs that Microsoft was going to interpret and then run.\\n\\nIn the 8-bit generation, most, if not all hardware providers of microcomputers just wrote their own operating systems. It just wasn\\'t a big deal. Now, there was one off-the-shelf operating system out there from a company called Digital Research, which was run by Gary Kildall, who, I think as we talked about earlier, Bill and Paul had actually intersected with back in Seattle.\\n\\nBen: Yup. I think they were reasonably friendly.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I think they were quite friendly because they partnered. You needed the operating system to get into the programming environment. It wasn\\'t that big of a deal. Whenever anybody needed one off-the-shelf, Bill and Microsoft would just refer people over to Digital to get it.\\n\\nBen: Yup. CP/M, right?\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. CP/M, which I think is maybe Control Program for Microprocessors, I think, is the abbreviation there.\\n\\nBen: God, they were so bad. Every single thing that\\'s been named to this point, except for the company Microsoft, was a horrible name. The processor is 8008, and now it\\'s 8080, but the machine is 8800, that the processor is inside. Give me a break, everyone. It\\'s horrible naming.\\n\\nDavid: Bill and I\\'m sure Paul too, but Bill is the only person in this industry that has the vision for what this can become, even Intel. Bill talks about this. He doesn\\'t think that Intel even realizes what\\'s happening here. They\\'re just like, oh, we\\'re just making more chips, and people use them for stuff.\\n\\nBen: It does seem like very few people are thinking about their products as something they really need to build a brand around with consumers, hence the naming schemes.\\n\\nDavid: The IBM, Microsoft discussions are going along. IBM\\'s like, oh, hey, yeah, we need an operating system. Bill, I think from everything we\\'ve read and folks we\\'ve talked to, in good faith just does the standard thing he\\'s always done in these situations. He\\'s like, oh yeah, go talk to Gary, go talk to Digital Research. He can probably do that.\\n\\nBen: Right. We don\\'t have an operating system, this guy does.\\n\\nDavid: What happens next is unclear. But what is clear is however it goes down, this is one of, if not the biggest business blunder in history. IBM, that team from Project Chess, flies down, I think, directly from Seattle and talking with Bill and Steve to Monterey, California, where Digital Research is based at this point, to meet with Gary and his wife, Dorothy, who run the business together. Bill\\'s called them. He\\'s like, hey, I got a big OEM client coming down, needs an operating system.\\n\\nBen: He signed hefty, hefty NDAs. He cannot say who it is, but he\\'s like, you really should take this seriously.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The team comes down. Obviously, they show up there from IBM. There\\'s a big snafu where Gary does not attend the meeting. There are conflicting reports about what happened.\\n\\nBen: Was it one of them that he\\'s out flying an airplane?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I\\'m pretty sure he was flying his personal airplane while this happens. Some reports are he was just out joyriding and missed it. Some reports are no, he was on a business trip, knew it was happening, but he had another important business meeting. He didn\\'t know that this was IBM that was coming. Regardless, it doesn\\'t really matter because IBM just wants the operating system.\\n\\nDorothy does meet with them. She\\'s unwilling to sign their NDA. There\\'s a lawyer from Digital Research who gets involved, and he doesn\\'t really understand what\\'s going on.\\n\\nThe punchline is that IBM leaves this interaction with the belief that Gary and Digital Research aren\\'t up for working with them and aren\\'t capable of producing here. Producing is important because it\\'s not like the existing CP/M OS that they made would work here. They would have to write a new version, a 16-bit version, and they hadn\\'t done that yet.\\n\\nBen: In particular, they would have to do some customizing. But part of what IBM wants is a customized version of an operating system for the IBM PC. They don\\'t want this to be fully off-the-shelf.\\n\\nJust to add one more stir the pot of history here, there is another version of this story where Gary does actually have a conversation with IBM, and it blows up over licensing terms. What Gary really wants is a significant royalty of every IBM PC sold, and IBM walks over that. Whether that happened or whether it\\'s just an NDA issue, either way, I think we all know the IBM PC did not end up running the CP/M operating system.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s amazing. I didn\\'t know that. We\\'ll talk about that when we get to the business terms of the Microsoft IBM deal in a minute. But for the moment, there\\'s no deal yet because an operating system needs to be provided here.\\n\\nIBM goes back to Microsoft and they\\'re like, hey, this guy you referred us to ain\\'t going to work. The way that I read some quotes from the IBM people here were like, we just threw the problem back in Microsoft\\'s lap of you guys deal with this, you source an operating system.\\n\\nI\\'d like to say that Bill, Steve, and Microsoft, you don\\'t need to give them an opportunity twice. In this case, you did need to give them an opportunity twice because they almost flubbed it and sent IBM down to see Gary. This time they don\\'t flub it. They\\'re like, okay, we\\'ll get you an operating system.\\n\\nBen: Enter Seattle Computer Products.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. It just so happens that right down the road from Microsoft in the Seattle area—I think despite being named Seattle Computer Products, I think this company was actually based in Tukwila, Washington—a programmer named Tim Patterson had just written a 16-bit operating system for the 8086 that Intel had just announced, and he was calling it the Quick and Dirty 16-bit Operating System or QDOS for short, and had it ready to go.\\n\\nWhy had he written this? What was this company, Seattle Computer Products? Why did they have an operating system? They were a component provider to microcomputer manufacturers. They essentially made motherboards. When Intel now has announced this new 16-bit processor generation that they\\'re coming out with, Seattle Computer Products want to sell motherboards and have them ready for 16-bit.\\n\\nThey need to test and play around with these things, and their customers are asking for it. They had been going to Kildall and Digital Research too and badgering them to like, hey, write the 16-bit version of CP/M. Gary just didn\\'t, so Tim\\'s like, fine, I\\'ll do a quick and dirty version myself, and thus DOS is born.\\n\\nBen: Incredible, which of course later, they would drop the Q and call it DOS, the Disk Operating System. Something about dirty didn\\'t have a ring to it when you\\'re selling it to IBM.\\n\\nDavid: No. Bill, Paul, and Microsoft have learned about this. They know Seattle Computer Products, they know Rod Brock, the guy who owns the company. They get in touch with him and they say, hey, can we license QDOS from you and Tim? We\\'ve got a big OEM customer that wants a 16-bit operating system. They work out a deal whereby Microsoft pays Seattle Computer Products $25,000 for the rights to adapt and sell QDOS to the one unnamed original equipment manufacturer who they\\'re working with.\\n\\nTim, actually, is jazzed about this. He ends up leaving SCP computer products and joining Microsoft. With the rest of the team, he\\'s part of building DOS, taking his initial work and turning it into real DOS. Later on, before this all gets announced and the PC ships, Microsoft would pay Seattle computer products another $50,000 for full rights to own 86 QDOS, sell and license it to anybody else indefinitely. I believe the total amount of dollars that changed hands here is $75,000.\\n\\nBen: Unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: This is DOS. One programmer wrote a \"quick and dirty\" operating system, and Microsoft bought the license to that and adapted it into DOS. Tim, when he was at Seattle computer products, definitely did not write DOS as DOS. It\\'s not like Microsoft bought all of DOS for $75,000. They did a lot of work on it, but this is how it all goes down.\\n\\nBen: Microsoft would eventually generate billions of dollars on DOS-based products. You\\'re exactly right in the same way that Instagram today is a much different code base than Instagram and much larger code base than Instagram when it was purchased, but my God, $75,000 to buy DOS to get this whole thing started. Until Windows 95, all of the Windows operating systems were DOS-based.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s just crazy. It really illustrates how fast things were moving, how much all this was getting invented and discovered in real time that even to this point, Bill Gates isn\\'t thinking that operating systems are that important. This is just a shortcut to get the deal done with IBM to make it happen.\\n\\nBen: Also, David, I got to say, I just looked it up. The address of Seattle Computer Products, on the original business card for Seattle Computer Products where I presume QDOS was written, the space is available, so I know where our next studio needs to be.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s in Tequila?\\n\\nBen: It\\'s in Tequila.\\n\\nDavid: All right. The rent can\\'t be that expensive then, so let\\'s do it.\\n\\nBen: Correct.\\n\\nDavid: Hell, yeah. We\\'ve been joking for years about making the Acquired Museum. We might have a location.\\n\\nOkay. Now they\\'ve got the operating system, they\\'ve got QDOS or DOS in place to license the IBM. The only thing that is left to formalize the partnership is the business terms.\\n\\nBen, if what you said is right about the Gary Kildall IBM negotiations, this is just a master stroke from Bill here in the licensing with IBM, because there are two really, really big levers that it looks like Bill is giving big time on one of them, but he is winning big time on the other one.\\n\\nBen: What are they?\\n\\nDavid: The one that it looks like he\\'s giving on is he does another fixed cost OEM deal with IBM.\\n\\nBen: This is in Paul Allen\\'s memoir. IBM paid Microsoft $75,000 for testing and consultation, $45,000 for DOS, and $310,000 for an array of 16-bit language interpreters and compilers. All told, bundled together, that is $430,000 fixed that IBM paid Microsoft with no ongoing obligation.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. No per copy royalties. Every copy of DOS that IBM sells is either included as part of systems that they\\'re selling, or they\\'re free to charge independently for DOS, whatever amount they want, Microsoft gets $0. If it\\'s true that this is where things fell apart with Gary Kildall, crazy that Bill is willing to do this.\\n\\nBen: You might say, what? Didn\\'t Bill learn his lesson? Why would he ever agree to this?\\n\\nDavid: On the one hand, this is what he was doing with Apple and others. He was doing these fixed cost deals. He would think, man, IBM, this is the time. People aren\\'t going to pirate IBM software. Now\\'s the time to really grab the money bags.\\n\\nBen: But Bill saw something that no one else did.\\n\\nDavid: I don\\'t know if it was directly in exchange in the negotiations, but the other lever that he saw, that he pulled was Microsoft retained the rights to own DOS and to own their languages and license it and them to anyone else they wanted at any price on any terms.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s so interesting, because what ended up happening that Bill Gates masterminded was once we distribute our operating system through IBM\\'s PC, that\\'s going to become the thing everyone buys. Now, in the 16-bit generation, when there are people building programs for computers, not just developers, once those application developers who are writing programs are targeting an operating system, then that is the operating system that every other OEM, every other computer maker is also going to want and really need, and we\\'re going to be the ones that they have to come to to buy it.\\n\\nI can\\'t figure out, did IBM miss this fact? Or did they know it? Basically, what IBM did was they were the one place where every business needed to go for their computer needs. What they did in this negotiation was they actually handed that over to Microsoft. They said, we are going to become a commodity, just like every other hardware manufacturer, and you are going to be the point of integration for the whole ecosystem. You\\'re going to be the linchpin that everyone has to target for their applications.\\n\\nDavid: I think there are two things going on here, one small and one big. The small thing is actually related all the way back to the beginning of the episode, what you said, Ben, about the antitrust concerns within IBM. To hear them say it, they actually didn\\'t want ownership of the software. They wanted it to be separate because it would look better.\\n\\nBen: Because then they have the plausible deniability of, how could we possibly have a monopoly? We\\'re buying off-the-shelf...\\n\\nDavid: Part of an ecosystem, blah-blah-blah. Yeah.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. From a vendor who can sell to anybody else. We have no lock in.\\n\\nDavid: That may well be true. I think the bigger thing that just wasn\\'t in their consideration or mindset was they (I think) assumed that once they entered the PC market, IBM was going to be the dominant player, so it didn\\'t matter. Once IBM is selling PCs, who\\'s going to buy a PC from anybody else? IBM is going to win this market.\\n\\nBen: Just like they have in every other line of business they\\'ve been in.\\n\\nDavid: What Bill saw was he really made a bet that the same dynamics that played out with the Altair were also going to play out with the IBM PC. There would be a million hardware manufacturers, flowers blooming here.\\n\\nBen: Building to the same spec.\\n\\nDavid: Building to the same spec.\\n\\nBen: Using the same processor.\\n\\nDavid: Which of course, they could because it was all off-the-shelf components. IBM either didn\\'t see or didn\\'t believe that that would actually happen.\\n\\nBen: IBM failed to see the value of software, and they certainly failed to understand what a software platform business model would be.\\n\\nDavid: Which makes sense. Why would they? They are the computing company.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Their experience in selling mainframes with everything bundled in was the wrong experience to go off of in understanding the way the future would unfold. Bill\\'s very modest experience watching the Altair and all these Altair clone type machines, or even if they\\'re not Altair clones, just more microcomputers that need more software, actually was the useful experience to pattern match off of of what does the world of microcomputers look like, and how is that fundamentally different than the world of mainframes.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. In a way that the mini computer generation, like we\\'ve been saying, it was like a half generation. It wasn\\'t actually fundamentally that different other than DEC gained a foothold.\\n\\nBen: The deal that Bill Gates made with IBM for the IBM PC is the greatest deal in at least computer industry history, if not all business history, full stop.\\n\\nDavid: Let\\'s say a little bit about why. It\\'s obvious, but here now is IBM, most valuable company in the world. They\\'re going to come out with the PC platform. They are going to build the market. Microsoft is going to own the linchpin, in Hamilton Helmer terms, where the power is in the market, and they\\'re going to be free to license it at whatever terms they want to any other player who wants to enter.\\n\\nThey signed this agreement in November 1980. The IBM PC ships in August 1981. Just incredible, almost exactly a little more than a year from the time Project Chess starts to when they actually ship the PC.\\n\\nBen: Truly incredible, they pulled it off.\\n\\nDavid: Truly incredible. It changes the world. That\\'s such a trite thing to say, but everything that everybody\\'s imagining happens.\\n\\nBen: IBM was right that it was by far in a way the most successful personal computer on the market as soon as they released it.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. They sell 13,500 IBM PCs within the first couple of months after they announce it. Over the next two years, they sell half a million of them, makes them unquestionably the largest personal microcomputer manufacturer/market leader. Everybody at IBM is celebrating. The clones haven\\'t arrived yet, and maybe they won\\'t. It\\'ll play out like they think. Not exactly.\\n\\nBefore we talk about the clones, this is really just a footnote because of course all the incentives are aligned for IBM to push DOS as the operating system for the PC. They\\'ve done this whole deal with Microsoft. They have a royalty-free deal with them.\\n\\nWhen they launch the PC, customers actually have a choice of which operating system they want on their IBM PC. They don\\'t have to go with DOS. Consumers can choose between DOS, 16-bit CP/M. By this point in time, Gary and Digital Research have gotten their act together. They\\'ve written a 16-bit version of the CPM operating system. Or another 16-bit operating system called Pascal that came out of the University of California at San Diego.\\n\\nThe price sheet for the operating system option is Pascal is an extra $450 with your IBM PC. CP/M is an extra $175 with your IBM PC, and DOS, which was developed specifically for the PC is the best way to run it is only $60. IBM is making $60 of full 100% margin on top of their hardware for the PC by selling DOS because they don\\'t have to pay Microsoft any of that, and they\\'ve set up the incentives that obviously everybody\\'s going to choose DOS.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s fascinating. And you know what? To give them a little bit more credit too, they did try to enforce that there\\'s some amount of lock-in to the IBM PC. They did that in two ways. One is we\\'re simplifying calling it DOS. It was PC-DOS, which is different than MS-DOS, which would get licensed to other computer makers. I don\\'t know exactly what happened, but it basically seems like it just wasn\\'t different enough to be meaningful to application developers. That\\'s one piece of it.\\n\\nThe second is IBM did actually have proprietary BIOS. That was another part where they thought that that might provide them some protection, where they could stay a linchpin in the ecosystem. It wasn\\'t just all off-the-shelf. They actually did have something that was theirs that was proprietary.\\n\\nDavid: It just turned out that the effort required to reverse engineer the IBM BIOS was trivial, basically.\\n\\nBen: Do you know the story of the Compaq BIOS?\\n\\nDavid: I know the Compaq story, but I don\\'t know the story of the BIOS specifically. Enlighten us.\\n\\nBen: \\u200aIt is basically why Compaq worked is what it comes down to. Compaq was formed basically to clone the IBM PC. They saw the market opportunity, and they realized they could buy from all the same equipment vendors. Let\\'s go eat their margin is basically the plan.\\n\\nHowever, the one thing that was not off-the-shelf is the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), which is effectively the thing that decides to load the operating system when you turn the machine on. There\\'s some proprietary magic that happens to call upon the operating system to do its thing. Compaq reverse engineered the BIOS. The way that they did it was very similar to Trip Hawkins and the story that he told us about his reverse engineering at Electronic Arts.\\n\\nDavid: Of the Psychogenesis.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Compaq had two engineers. One engineer went in and fully dissected the code for the IBM PC BIOS, basically saw all the proprietary calls that it made, and documented each of those calls without writing the implementation steps. Then he handed, hey, here\\'s what the BIOS needs to interface with, over to the other engineer. The other engineer, on their own, just went through and thought of an implementation.\\n\\nThey have no idea if it\\'s the same implementation, so it\\'s not breaking any infringement. They\\'re basically saying, I\\'m just seeing the requirements for this product, and I\\'m coming up with my own implementation of that product. They basically figured out how to exactly clone the IBM PC and buy the very same operating system.\\n\\nTo go back to quoting Ben Thompson because this is from his great piece again, \"The result was a company that came to dominate the market. Compaq was the fastest startup to ever hit $100 million in revenue, then the youngest firm to break into the Fortune 500, then the fastest company to hit $1 billion in revenue, and by 1994, Compaq was the largest PC maker in the world.\"\\n\\nDavid: The Compaq story is amazing. The three people who start Compaq in 1982 are actually Texas Instruments engineers who left, and they wanted to start a company. I believe as the legend goes, they were trying to decide what to start. They were considering a restaurant chain and a bunch of different business ideas. The IBM PC comes out at the end of 1981 and they\\'re like, oh, we can clone this and do everything, the story you just told. It\\'s wild. They start the company in 1982. Within the first year, they do $111 million of revenue of selling IBM PC clone hardware.\\n\\nBen: And is it just cheaper? Basically this is the IBM PC, but for less money?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, exactly. Same thing, cheaper.\\n\\nBen: So begins the race to the bottom of PC hardware. Completely undifferentiated, all the value accrues to the software layer.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Compaq went public the very next year, in 1983 well before Microsoft, which is funny. Compaq, all these other clone companies that get started. Microsoft licenses DOS to all of them importantly, critically, on a per-machine-sold basis. This is when they grab the money. The operating system is so deeply embedded and needs to get shipped with the computer itself.\\n\\nConsumers can go buy operating systems to upgrade and whatnot, but no hardware manufacturer is going to ship a 16-bit PC without an operating system. Piracy is not an issue here. Microsoft can now do a per-copy-sold, per-machine-sold license with all these clones. My God, it\\'s just a geyser of money.\\n\\nBen: Microsoft used IBM to generate demand for their software, and then they used every other PC manufacturer to capture the value that all that demand created.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I think I have these numbers and timeframes right. I believe that for calendar year 1982, Microsoft\\'s revenue was $25 million. I think this must have been when they switched to fiscal year end and June 30th. Microsoft\\'s fiscal year end starting then and up through now is June 30th.\\n\\nThey\\'re fiscal 1984. The year ended June 30th, 1984, so 1983 midpoint to 1984 midpoint. Microsoft does $98 million. In an 18-month period from the end of 1982, they go from $25–$98 million. It\\'s all on the back of the clones. Unlike Compaq that they did $111 million of revenue their first year, they\\'re selling hardware which has serious cogs associated with it. Microsoft, 100% essentially, gross margin, software revenue, more than doubling year on year. It\\'s the best business of all time.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and they combined two magical principles together. This infinite replicability, zero marginal costs of software, and becoming the linchpin of the ecosystem. They are now the software that everyone needs to target, which gives them pricing power. That pricing power raises your top line, and you have no costs. It\\'s unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: Meanwhile, in the computing industry background, while all this is going on with the launch of the IBM PC and then the clones, Apple had gone public at the end of 1980 in I think, the biggest and most successful IPO of all time at that point. Remember we talked about Genentech on the Novo Nordisk episode. They went public right before Apple, and then Apple was bigger. They\\'re valued at $1.8 billion at IPO. Steve Jobs is this multi hundred millionaire, media darling, all this stuff.\\n\\nThe next year in 1981, Microsoft reorganizes from the partnership between Bill and Paul with the handshake deal that Steve\\'s going to be cut in on the partnership into a stock company, a C-corporation. As part of doing that, the venture firm, Technology Venture Investors (TVI) invest $1 million, I believe, for 5% of the company. This is crazy. That\\'s a $20 million post money valuation.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s a 1-on-20 post when Microsoft is doing how much in revenue?\\n\\nDavid: That year, they did $17 million in revenue, and they\\'re about to do the IBM deal. This is absolutely absurd.\\n\\nBen: It says a lot about this period of time that you could do a 1X revenue deal in a high-margin software company. I actually don\\'t think this shows a weakness in Microsoft. Oh, they didn\\'t have leverage or something that. That wasn\\'t it at all, it was just the deals sucked.\\n\\nDavid: Venture capital sucked back then. There\\'s no other way to put it.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s only 5%, so good on Microsoft. Spoiler alert, this is the only dilution that they would ever take. That\\'s also extremely different than today, but a $20 million valuation at this stage is frankly ludicrous.\\n\\nDavid: Even among people who should be in the know, the beauty of the software business model still is something people don\\'t understand.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s exactly right.\\n\\nDavid: The hotness is the hardware. It\\'s like Apple just IPO\\'d. Apple\\'s worth $1.8 billion. Like, ooh, that\\'s the industry, ooh, it\\'s IBM, et cetera. When Microsoft itself would go public a few years later in 1986, they actually go public the same week that they moved to the big campus in Redmond, where they are to this day. Their market cap at IPO is only $750 million despite having done $200 million of very high margin software revenue in the trailing 12 months up to that, growing 100% year over year. It\\'s insane.\\n\\nBen: Hey, that\\'s 4X multiple expansion off the last time they raised money.\\n\\nDavid: Right? It\\'s just crazy that people don\\'t yet appreciate the power.\\n\\nBen: Bill Gates and Warren Buffett did a conversation at the University of Washington in 1998. This is as late as 1998. This thing that we\\'re talking about, the magic of the software business model and how it should be reflected in a company\\'s valuation especially when it\\'s a high-growth company was still not understood even by Bill Gates himself.\\n\\nHere\\'s the quote. Bill Gates says, \"I think the multiples of technology stocks should be quite a bit lower than the multiples of stocks like Coke and Gillette because we are subject to complete changes in the rules. I know very well that in the next 10 years, if Microsoft is still a leader, we will have had to weather at least three crises.\" Bill Gates is essentially making an argument. Granted, this is in the middle of all the antitrust stuff, so he\\'s very prime for this.\\n\\nDavid: And the Internet.\\n\\nBen: And the Internet. He\\'s basically making the argument that disruptive forces come at you so fast in the technology industry that even though you can grow extremely fast, it\\'s this extremely scalable thing, distributing software at zero distribution costs, and even though the margins are unbelievable because you have zero marginal costs, they still shouldn\\'t be valued as highly as a CPG company, which is so different than the way that people think about it today.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s funny. I\\'ve thought about this a lot, and I actually watched that interview years ago. It\\'s so good. There are elements of truth to this too. I think it\\'s that for most technology companies, that is totally true. For a few technology companies that have true power and true scale, the exact opposite is true. Microsoft is still the most valuable company in the world today.\\n\\nBen: Companies that are less susceptible to disruption, more predictable in terms of high growth, high margin revenue deserve a premium. But Gates is basically arguing, everyone else doesn\\'t.\\n\\nLet\\'s flash all the way back to 1981 and talk about this venture capital investment, this 1-on-20 that TVI does.\\n\\nDavid: Good work if you can get a man.\\n\\nBen: How does this come to be? Even a whole year before in the fall of 1980, Dave Marquardt, one of the partners and the founders at TVI, flies up to Seattle not to meet Bill Gates, but to meet Steve Ballmer.\\n\\nDavid: Because they were classmates at GSB, right?\\n\\nBen: They weren\\'t quite classmates, but because I think they were two years apart, so they didn\\'t overlap, but they had some of the same social circles. Steve was effectively the screener for anyone who wanted to come and talk to Bill and try and invest in the business.\\n\\nTA Associates had been up, Sutter Hill had been up, Hambrick and Quist had been up, Xerox Ventures, and all of them only ever got to meet with Steve Ballmer and never got passed on to Bill Gates. Steve would basically just bounce them off. I know all this because there\\'s a great oral history from the Computer History Museum, where this whole thing\\'s in a transcript with an interview with Dave Marquardt recalling the whole thing.\\n\\nDave flies up to meet with Steve. Steve says, you\\'re asking really interesting questions. You\\'re thinking about our strategy the right way. You don\\'t just want to do a transactional deal. You really think this is something special. Why don\\'t you meet with Bill? Bill, of course, doesn\\'t have any extra time in his schedule. He says, but I am going to the U-Dub Arizona football game at Husky stadium. Why don\\'t you come and talk to me there?\\n\\nOf course they go, Bill doesn\\'t pay attention to the game at all. He\\'s just laying out the strategy, grilling Dave, and talking about software the whole time. This is fall of 1980. That\\'s a whole year before the deal gets done. Dave\\'s remarking at this point in 1980, they\\'re doing $5 million in revenue, $2–$3 million in profit. They don\\'t need VC money, and yet he was able to get in.\\n\\nHere\\'s the quote. \"I was just helping them out with the business. In the venture business, you\\'re buying and you\\'re selling at the same time. You\\'re trying to figure out, are these guys crazy? Are they ever going to do anything really interesting? If so, how do I get myself positioned to be able to help them do it? So I spent a lot of time up there helping recruit people. I helped to recruit Charles Simonyi, who was an early key guy.\" Charles Simonyi would go on, this is an aside, to write Microsoft Word. Charles was at Xerox PARC inventing the GUI.\\n\\nDavid: We\\'re going to talk about Charles in just a sec.\\n\\nBen: Yes. He says, “And I was working with Steve on business strategy. They had these OEM customers, the PC manufacturers, and they had started to engage with IBM on this operating system. Are we just going to become a low-cost contract programming shop for IBM, an outsourced sweatshop? Or is there some way we can build a business out of this?\\n\\nWhich led to the fixed fee to IBM, the retention of the code, which then we could sell to other people. That\\'s what created the PC industry basically.” That is his recollection of the whole thing, that he was very helpful in this transformative time for the company. At the same time, you have to look at everyone else\\'s incentives.\\n\\nDavid: How can I be helpful, Ben?\\n\\nBen: Dave is only 29 years old, but everyone else is 23. He actually is adult supervision. At the same time, the partnership was still just a partnership, and there was a handshake deal for the equity. If you\\'re Steve Ballmer at this point in history, it would be nice to have a forcing function to actually turn this into a corporation so that we can get some shares granted here. There\\'s a little bit of incentive to say, hey, if we take on an outside investor, we\\'re going to have to restructure.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s what I had always read about the TVI investment. Obviously, Microsoft didn\\'t need the money. They like Dave, but also a big part of it was this was a catalyzing function to do the conversion into a C-corp.\\n\\nBen: Yes. This would create a little bit of board and governance, so it\\'s not just Bill all the time. Bill, of course, I think is still the controlling shareholder just by the amount of stock that he owns. But there\\'s a board. It\\'s Bill, it\\'s Dave, and it\\'s Kay Nishi. It\\'s a three-person board.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, we should say-to-vis a vis Paul, tragically, and I believe it was 1982-1983, he\\'s diagnosed with Hodgkin\\'s disease. He ends up taking a leave and then fully leaving the company. I think he did go on and off the board at various points in time.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true.\\n\\nDavid: But he\\'s no longer a full-time member of the company after his diagnosis.\\n\\nBen: Yup. On this venture investment, it\\'s pretty fascinating. None of these are terribly compelling reasons other than, I guess, it would be nice to have a little bit of capital associated with us formalizing the corporation, but they don\\'t need money at all. They\\'re printing cash. They\\'ve been printing cash ever since that one tight period in Albuquerque. Dave charmed them. I think that\\'s the answer.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'ve always heard wonderful, wonderful things about Dave, and I think everybody really did love him and see his value. But man, to be a venture capitalist in the 1980s and 1990s, oh, man, you couldn\\'t lose.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s pretty crazy. I think part of it too had to do with the fact that Microsoft was up in Seattle. The VCs just weren\\'t traveling. Dave was young and he was single.\\n\\nDavid: Don Valentine famously had the rule. They didn\\'t invest in any company that you couldn\\'t bicycle to from Sand Hill Road.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s crazy. Dave Marquardt, I think most weekends, is flying up to Seattle to hang out with Bill and Steve. It was a real sell. He says, I was young, I was single, I had nothing better to do, and it was really fun and intellectually interesting, so I did it. That resulted in, depending how long TVI held, one of, if not the best venture capital return in history.\\n\\nDavid: Hard to argue with that one. Okay, back to the story. There are a couple more really, really key things that happened in the PC era. Particularly now, once we\\'re into the IBM PC era and the clones, the 16-bit era. Let\\'s start with applications.\\n\\nLike we\\'ve been saying all along, the 8-bit era, applications, package software aren\\'t really a thing. In 1979, at the tail end of the 8-bit era, two programs come out for the Apple II, VisiCalc and WordStar. VisiCalc is the first software spreadsheet application, and WordStar is a word processor. These applications by today\\'s standards are super simple, stone age–type stuff, but they\\'re the first of their kind, particularly VisiCalc and the spreadsheet. They established the potential for business applications on personal computers.\\n\\nThere\\'s a joke at one point in the industry that the Apple II was a \"VisiCalc\" accessory for small businesses. I think that is part of what IBM is seeing and why they\\'re deciding to now get into the industry with the personal computer. Around this time, Microsoft starts the \"Consumer Products Division\" to compete and make application software themselves.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s quite telling it\\'s called the Consumer Products Division to make applications. Even though they\\'re competing to make these applications that today we would view as business tools, spreadsheets, and word processing, that is not how they referred to it.\\n\\nDavid: Right. One of the first people that they hire into this new division to get it going is an engineer, Ben, who you referenced just a minute ago, named Charles Simonyi. They poach Charles, perhaps with Dave Marquardt\\'s help, away from the legendary Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC). I think this is one of the great misconceptions in technology history. Hopefully we can set the record straight a little bit here.\\n\\nBen: Yes. If you ask anybody in our ecosystem, save for the 1% of people who actually know this, what happened at Xerox PARC? They will tell you they invented the mouse, they invented the graphical user interface, and then Steve Jobs walked in, he saw it all, and he said, oh, my God, we have to have it. He went off and he made the Lisa, which had a graphical user interface and a mouse. That failed, but what succeeded was the Macintosh, and it\\'s a wholesale ripoff of Xerox PARC that lives on today in Apple. That is the story that you will hear from basically everyone.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'ve heard it characterized as something like Xerox hosted a picnic in Silicon Valley, and Steve Jobs attended and dined lavishly at the feast.\\n\\nBen: All of this is true.\\n\\nDavid: Which is true. That is true. All of that is true.\\n\\nBen: But it\\'s half the story.\\n\\nDavid: He was not the only person who dined lavishly at the feast. Microsoft did just as much directly from Xerox, and Charles was one of the main vectors by which this happened.\\n\\nHere is the list of things that were invented or basically invented at Xerox PARC. The graphical user interface, the desktop, the mouse, object-oriented programming, ethernet, laser printing, along with a whole host of other things. This is everything about modern computing, invented there.\\n\\nWho are the people who were at Xerox PARC? There was Alan Kay, there was Bob Metcalfe, who would go on to found 3Com. He invented ethernet, Metcalfe\\'s Law.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, the value of a network scaling proportionally to the square of the number of inputs.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Bob Metcalf, Xerox PARC, Larry Tesler, who would join Apple, John Warnock, who started Adobe, Eric Schmidt worked at Xerox PARC. Everybody was there. It was a lavish picnic.\\n\\nBen: And Charles Simonyi.\\n\\nDavid: And Charles Simonyi. The thing about PARC and the computer that they built there to instantiate all these concepts, which was named the Alto, is it really was a research center. The Alto, go look it up on Wikipedia, go look at pictures. It\\'s the Mac. The Alto is the Mac.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s the Mac with the monitor turned on its side.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, it\\'s a vertical Mac.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s a 3x4 display, not a 4x3 display.\\n\\nDavid: They start making it in 1973. You might be like, wait a minute, what\\'s going on here? The Mac doesn\\'t come out till 1984.\\n\\nBen: 11 years earlier.\\n\\nDavid: How on earth is Xerox making the Mac in the pre 8-bit era, the pre-microprocessor era? It\\'s not a microprocessor. The Alto is not a microprocessor architecture. It\\'s a mini computer. What you see when you look at photos of the Alto is you see the Mac. What you don\\'t see is under the table or behind it is a mini computer.\\n\\nBen: I never realized that.\\n\\nDavid: It is not a personal computer architecture at all. It is a 16-bit, essentially mini computer, that costs tens of thousands of dollars to make each one of them. It\\'s a science project.\\n\\nBen: You should have a little bit more generosity for the East Coast management at Xerox for failing to commercialize this.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. The time was not right. It was not possible. It wasn\\'t even conceived of in the microprocessor architecture, because the microprocessor basically didn\\'t exist when they made it.\\n\\nBen: Interesting.\\n\\nDavid: In 1980, again, this year for Microsoft, same year Microsoft joins, same year they signed the IBM partnership, Charles Simonyi comes up from Xerox PARC. He\\'s of course bringing all this same knowledge, all this same experience that Steve jobs is bringing into Apple. He\\'s bringing all that right into Microsoft too.\\n\\nThe first thing that he gets tasked with is working with this new consumer products division to build application software to compete with VisiCalc and WordStar to compete with spreadsheets and to compete in word processing. He leads the teams that create Word and MultiPlan, Microsoft\\'s first spreadsheet. Remember, we\\'re still at the end of the 8-bit era. The graphical user interface doesn\\'t exist yet other than on the Alto in Xerox PARC.\\n\\nBen: No, these are DOS applications. It\\'s all character mode.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, it is command line interface. The vector that they think they\\'re going to compete, at least in spreadsheets with VisiCalc, is that they\\'re going to be on every platform out there. VisiCalc, I believe, was more or less basically only on the Apple II. That doesn\\'t end up working too well.\\n\\nThe next generation, the IBM PC era, they make the same mistake. The application business stays focused on being on lots of machines, making software that\\'s compatible with everything. A new company pops up called Lotus. Lotus makes the radical decision that they are going to make a spreadsheet only for the IBM PC.\\n\\nThis was genius. This is the 1-2-3 spreadsheet. It goes on to become, at that point in time, the most successful software ever. This is wild. I can\\'t even believe I\\'m about to say this, and it blew my mind when I found it in research. There are a couple of years in the late eighties, where Lotus has more revenue than Microsoft and is valued higher.\\n\\nBen: Yup. In fact, the year that Microsoft went public, Lotus had more revenue than Microsoft at the IPO.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Wild.\\n\\nBen: it\\'s crazy. Lotus 1-2-3 had some graphics, but it was still in character mode. It was a powerful spreadsheet that could start to do some graphics, even though there wasn\\'t actually a GUI operating system yet, which is interesting. Lotus 1-2-3 was faster, it had bigger spreadsheets, and it was just more powerful. Microsoft Multiplan was still targeting the older 8-bit.\\n\\nMultiplan, despite Microsoft\\'s best efforts, is completely left in the dust. Microsoft\\'s trying to figure out, what should we learn from this? In talking with Pete Higgins and Mike Slade, who were both early leaders in the development and the marketing of the applications division, actually, Mike Slade went on to work directly for Steve Jobs at NeXT and Apple for many years.\\n\\nIn chatting with both of them, what basically became apparent Microsoft learned, with our applications, we should not be targeting the current platforms at all. The lesson to learn is never leave yourself open to the next generation of technology. They\\'re learning the Moore\\'s Law lesson again.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and how it applies to applications. Yes. You always got to target the next platform.\\n\\nBen: Right, even if that platform is not the one you own. That\\'s the interesting thing about when they\\'re evaluating Multiplan and they say, how do we not get Lotus 1-2-3 again, basically, the applications team gets the freedom to look around and say, okay, no matter what our overall company strategy is right now, or no matter what the systems division is doing, what is the most cutting-edge platform that is going to be so interesting to people that we can develop the most envelope-pushing technology for it? That becomes the mandate for applications.\\n\\nDavid: This is the dawn of horizontal software. You can have a whole company or a whole division of a company, in Microsoft\\'s case, that makes this tool. That tool will be so much better than anything that even the largest companies can have their own software developers write. General Electric isn\\'t going to write a better spreadsheet than 1-2-3. I think that the technology complement to this law is the killer app.\\n\\nBen: You have to counter position. If 1-2-3 is the best spreadsheet out there for the current technology generation, you just can\\'t compete with them. You need to wait for the next big leap forward in order to find a new competitive vector.\\n\\nDavid: You need to be the killer app on the next platform, and that\\'s what Lotus 1-2-3 did with the spreadsheet on the IBM PC and IBM compatible PC. That\\'s what Microsoft decides, hey, we got to do this in the graphical interface.\\n\\nBen: Who\\'s about to come out with the very best instantiation of a graphical user interface? Apple computer.\\n\\nDavid: That would be Steve Jobs.\\n\\nBen: Yes. The next chapter of our Microsoft story is the Macintosh in 1984.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s so fun.\\n\\nBen: Before we do that, this is the perfect time to talk about another one of our favorite companies and longtime Acquired partners who are back, pilot.com. For startups and growth companies of all kinds, Pilot handles all of your company\\'s accounting, tax, and bookkeeping needs, and is in fact now by far the largest startup focused accounting firm in the entire US.\\n\\nDavid: Also, we have to give our good buddy and Pilot CEO, Waseem Daher, a special shout out here because I think he is now the only Acquired sponsor CEO, who is also a source for an episode, because back when Waseem was a student at MIT, he interviewed Bill Gates for the school paper. He dug up the PDF and sent it to us. We\\'re going to link to it in the episode sources.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Very fun. Back to Pilot, and speaking of incredibly successful Seattle business people, we talk all the time on Acquired about Jeff Bezos\\' AWS-inspired axiom that startups should focus on what makes their beer taste better, i.e. only spend your limited time and resources on what is actually going to move the needle for you, your product, your customers, and outsource everything else that you need to do as a company but doesn\\'t fit that bill.\\n\\nAccounting is example number one of what he\\'s talking about. Every company needs this, but it needs to be done by a professional. You don\\'t want to take any risk of something going wrong. But at the same time, it actually has zero impact on your product or your customers.\\n\\nDavid: So enter Pilot. Pilot both sets up and operates your company\\'s entire financial stack, finance, accounting, tax, even CFO services like investor reporting from your general ledger, all the way up to budgeting and financial sections of your board decks. They\\'ve been doing this now for years across thousands of startups in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. There\\'s nobody better who you can trust to both get finance right and make it easy and painless for your company.\\n\\nBen: These are now companies like OpenAI, Airtable, Scale, as well as large ecommerce companies. It\\'s not just that they have the experience across startups, they can also keep working with you as you scale to the growth phase and beyond. If your company wants to go back to focusing on what makes your beer taste better, go on over to pilot.com/acquired and tell them that Ben and David sent you.\\n\\nAll right, David, why are we talking about the Mac?\\n\\nDavid: Because I think it\\'s fair to say that the Mac made Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Office made the Mac. I don\\'t think that it\\'s actually a controversial statement, although it probably sounds crazy to many of you listening.\\n\\nBen: Totally. Far and away the first thing to point out is the first version of Microsoft Excel was for the Mac. It\\'s especially crazy for all the finance people today who are like, oh, Mac Excel isn\\'t real Excel. Excel has to happen on Windows.\\n\\nDavid: No, Excel was on the Mac. That was it.\\n\\nBen: Yes. The logic basically was Microsoft was really coming around to the idea that the next big thing in computing was the graphical user interface. The reason they were coming around to this was because they knew from Xerox PARC just as well as Apple did, and they were rapidly trying to figure out how to get All of that Xerox PARC-iness into their product line, too. That\\'s the other half of this untold Xerox PARC story.\\n\\nOne of the first ways that they see to bring the graphical user interface to their products is launching Excel for the Mac because they basically see, the way that we got destroyed with Lotus 1-2-3, we can\\'t compete with lotus on the IBM PC, so we\\'re going to shelf Multiplan start over, and Excel is going to come out in the graphical user interface. We\\'re going to try to be first and best on the GUI.\\n\\nDavid: One thing just to underscore here, Excel is the world\\'s first graphical spreadsheet program. That\\'s why it wins, and that\\'s why it\\'s so important. Imagine trying to use Excel in the command line interface. That\\'s what VisiCalc was, that\\'s what even 1-2-3 was. Yeah, useful, better than nothing, but graphical charts, cells, visual relationships, this is so important. Excel is where it all starts.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Of course, Apple loves this. The Macintosh came out in 1984, and everybody remembers the great intro video and the hello script. I\\'ve watched that Steve Jobs keynote because of course, I have, and it\\'s this magical moment in computing history where finally something that\\'s insanely great comes out. It\\'s the beginning of Steve Jobs\\' unbelievable presentation prowess. It\\'s so fun to watch it. It\\'s, of course, a product that eventually people really loved. But at first...\\n\\nDavid: It doesn\\'t have the killer app.\\n\\nBen: No, it\\'s a product that was supposed to ship in 1982. It didn\\'t, it shipped in 1984. At the time, what they were targeting for 1982 was a pretty great set of technologies. By 1984, it\\'s an aging set of technologies. It debuts with 128K of memory, which basically isn\\'t enough to create any interesting applications. Developers are ignoring it as an interesting platform to develop on. Within 12 months, they figure it out and come out with a better version that\\'s 512K. That\\'s the version that people now really think about.\\n\\nDavid: That gets re-christened as like, that\\'s the original Mac. The original original is the Mac 128 or something that.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. But in the meantime, Microsoft, the applications group is working their ass off to make something really great for the Macintosh, and they come up with Excel. What ends up happening is Apple\\'s really trying to promote the sales of this machine. They view Excel and PageMaker as the killer apps, as reasons that people should buy this thing, because once you run through a lot of the demo apps and the stuff that Apple built, you\\'re like, okay, what else is here? It\\'s crickets.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Writing hello in script is cool, but like a lot of VR stuff, you\\'re like, oh, that\\'s a cool demo, but you\\'re going to do that every day? No.\\n\\nBen: I\\'m not sure this has ever been publicly disclosed before, but Apple spent just as much marketing Excel as Microsoft did. They matched Microsoft\\'s marketing spend with their own campaign for it and split the bill.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s amazing.\\n\\nBen: You\\'ve got a couple of concurrent things going on in applications land. You\\'ve got Excel coming out for Mac to take advantage of the GUI. This strategy is just all over the place, I think that\\'s an interesting thing to underscore about Microsoft in this era. They\\'re trying a ton of stuff because they\\'re paranoid. They don\\'t want to miss the next wave. Meanwhile, also in the applications group, Charles Simonyi has written Word. This is about a year before in 1983. Microsoft Word comes out for DOS.\\n\\nDavid: Right, and they ship it with a mouse.\\n\\nBen: Yes. This is like, okay, we see the Xerox PARC stuff coming out in the Mac. Great, Excel will be for that. We want to develop Word. We\\'re going to do that for DOS. But I can imagine how useful the mouse is going to be in a word processing environment. They actually ship a mouse tied to the application that\\'s not a part of DOS. This is how early we were in figuring out what the split between applications and platforms were at this point in history. Microsoft thought maybe a mouse makes sense just for this one application, even though it doesn\\'t do anything else for the rest of the command line interface.\\n\\nDavid: It was all being figured out. I think it is also really fair to say that Microsoft was right there with Apple in the Mac development phase. Obviously, they\\'re working on Excel, working on other what would become the Office Suite applications together for Mac.\\n\\nSteve Jobs shows Bill Gates the Mac project in 1981, three years before it ships. Microsoft and Apple signed an agreement to work together on applications for it in 1982. They were very deeply embedded on this, which is going to make the lawsuit and what comes up in a minute here all the more funny.\\n\\nBen: The decision for the Excel team is to focus on GUI. The whole marketing message is Excel on a Mac is better than Lotus 1-2-3 on a PC. You\\'re starting to see truly divergent cultures at Microsoft between the systems group, which is currently making DOS.\\n\\nWe\\'ll soon make Windows, soon partner with IBM, or soon do something else that we\\'re getting into here in the next chapter of the story, and the applications group, which is also currently a bunch of disparate applications and teams targeting disparate platforms, but is also about to become unified in their next chapter. Within the applications group, that next chapter is Microsoft Office.\\n\\nIn 1985, in January, the bundle is released. It was originally called the Business Pack for Microsoft. It started on the Mac.\\n\\nDavid: It really rolls off the tongue.\\n\\nBen: Totally does. They haven\\'t acquired PowerPoint yet or forethought as we talked about eight years ago on Acquired way back in history. There\\'s no PowerPoint, it\\'s not part of the bundle. What you\\'ve got here on the Mac and the first version of Office is Word, which they\\'ve developed in house, File, Chart, and Multiplan. This first notion of a suite, so today we\\'re very familiar with suite—Creative Suite over at Adobe. Software is sold this way. This was the first time.\\n\\nWhat was actually happening is all of the bundling was happening in pricing, in marketing, and in manufacturing. You had a single box that they would ship with the different applications by 1988 or 1989. It was Word, Excel, PowerPoint. They\\'re very different things, but they\\'re getting bundled together in a way to be sold to customers, but there\\'s no product integration.\\n\\nYou don\\'t have the ability to do this very nice copy-paste from an Excel table and just paste that into Word. That whole idea is pretty far away. In this earliest Microsoft Office, it was just, how can we bundle something for a cheaper price if you buy all three and make marketing easier for us to have this unified message?\\n\\nDavid: Soon to come—and we\\'ll get into Windows here in a second—one of the big killer app for productivity in particular for business productivity with a graphical user interface like Windows and true multitasking, you can get copy-paste from Excel into PowerPoint. Lotus and the world back in the command line interface where you\\'ve got these programs running on top of DOS, that is a completely foreign concept.\\n\\nBen: Right, none of those verbs exist.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. We\\'ve now set the stage of Microsoft\\'s doing a lot of stuff. They\\'re hedging a lot of bets, they\\'re not totally sure which strategy is going to win out, they\\'re not sure which platform is going to win out. They\\'re not sure if they\\'re more of a systems company or an application company, but what they are unified on is we make great software for personal computers. I think anything that fell into that purview, they were willing to explore.\\n\\nThey didn\\'t really have hard boundaries between, we\\'ll do anything to make our operating systems great, or we\\'ll do anything to advantage our applications. Even we think we\\'re an enterprise company, we think we\\'re a consumer company. They just didn\\'t have well formed opinions yet. It was just we make software for personal computers.\\n\\nDavid: At this point in time, the actual boundary between an operating system and an application is very fluid.\\n\\nBen: You\\'ve got a mouse that works for one program.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Lotus would really go down a dead end evolutionary path with Notes later in its life and its final chapter, where the application was going to be the operating system.\\n\\nBen: Right. Lotus Notes was crazy. It was a word processor, an email service, and it was a platform on which you could write other applications.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and it itself was an application.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Not an operating system. It was all dynamic. Speaking of though, Microsoft here is in bed with Apple, working on the Mac. Bill and the company are big believers in the future of the graphical user interface. Starting in 1983, they\\'re like, we got to do our own graphical operating system or at least user interface. This is the origins of the Windows product. They actually announced it in November, 1983, before the Mac ends up shipping, which their partner, Apple, is of course not happy about.\\n\\nJust development of the Mac was rocky, development of Windows was super freaking rocky within Microsoft, too. This is around that same time when Paul Allen gets Hodgkin\\'s disease and leaves the company. His presence as great technical leader is very much missed, but they bring in someone from Xerox to manage the development of Windows.\\n\\nThat person ends up not working out, he gets fired. Steve Ballmer gets drafted to come in and be the dev manager for the final push to release Windows 1.0, which is hilarious. You can find amazing YouTube videos from the launch and all joking about how non technical Steve coming in to Save the day and dev manage windows to launch.\\n\\nBen: Which is so funny. I don\\'t think at this point in history, the lines were clearly formed among the executives yet. Steve wasn\\'t running the global sales force, and Microsoft wasn\\'t an enterprise company.\\n\\nDavid: No, we\\'re going to get to that later.\\n\\nBen: Steve was one of the smart executives, they were a software company, and someone had to manage getting the software out the door. Windows 1.0 comes out. It\\'s bad.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s bad. November 1985, Windows 1.0 is a very, very different thing than you imagine a graphical user interface is today or what you know of as Windows. It was tiled. It was not overlapping Windows that you can drag around and have one over the other. When you opened a program in Windows 1.0, the system created a literal window of it on your screen, and then it dynamically resized the windows as you open other applications. Nothing could ever be on top of each other. As you open more and more stuff, the windows get smaller and smaller and smaller. It\\'s very bizarre.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. The idea of windows overlapping on top of each other, that was a uniquely Mac thing and a thing that smart engineers at Apple figured out how to do that in a performant way that offers good user experience. I would classify Windows 1.0 as a half step between command line and an actual graphical user interface.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, 100%. I believe Microsoft and Apple actually did a licensing agreement while they were working together during this time that said, hey, Microsoft can use a lot of the stuff that\\'s being developed for Mac for Windows 1.0.\\n\\nBen: Yes, that\\'s right. Apple does do a deal to license a lot of \"their intellectual property\" which of course came from Xerox, to Microsoft. Apple, I think, was under the impression that it was just for Windows 1.0, but the actual terms of the agreement are this and all future versions of Windows, which comes back to haunt Apple later. But yes, they totally get the license.\\n\\nDavid: Also, by the time that this agreement actually happens, I think Steve Jobs has been ousted, so it\\'s Scully who does this agreement. People in Apple would look back on this for years and be like, this was a huge error.\\n\\nThe other important thing about Windows during this awkward teenage phase is it\\'s not an operating system. It\\'s just a graphical interface on top of DOS.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: The original name for Windows was Interface Manager.\\n\\nBen: Isn\\'t it crazy? In all of their early marketing, they referred to it as Windows, a graphical operating environment that runs on the Microsoft MS-DOS operating system. Actually, it was not until Windows 95 that Windows was its own operating system. It was in Windows 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups. It was a graphical operating environment.\\n\\nHere\\'s the question. Why is Microsoft doing Windows? Obviously here, Microsoft knows they need to evolve DOS. They need to figure something out for the graphical world. David, are you telling me that Windows is the widely agreed upon future of the company and that\\'s just a straight line?\\n\\nDavid: Obviously that\\'s a setup there. Here\\'s the other thing that\\'s happening in the company at this time, and it\\'s the bigger thing. It\\'s the next phase of the IBM relationship. Windows, the Mac, all of this, are hedges for the company. Microsoft and Bill, in particular, were masters of hedging their bets in an uncertain technology future.\\n\\nHe was so great. The company was so great at making sure that whichever way the apple fell from the tree, as Jetson Huang put it to us in our interview, Microsoft was going to be positioned to catch it. A lot of people, including Bill and Microsoft themselves, believe that the way that apple was going to fall from the tree here was IBM and OS/2.\\n\\nBen: The IBM PC was such a big deal last time around. You would think that whatever IBM wants to do next is a pretty good way to ally yourself.\\n\\nDavid: What\\'s going on here? IBM, obviously the PC was a huge success, but losing dominance of the ecosystem to the clones, this was bad. IBM wants to find a way to evolve the PC ecosystem back to being more IBM proprietary. They\\'re going to make Microsoft come along for the ride here.\\n\\nThe way that they\\'re going to do this is with the next generation of the PC ecosystem, they are going to make a whole new modern operating system. They\\'re going to get rid of DOS. They\\'re going to make this operating system in partnership with Microsoft, and it\\'s going to be called, fittingly, OS/2. They are going to lock Microsoft up that they can\\'t license it to anybody else. OS/2 is going to be proprietary to IBM hardware, just like the Mac operating system is proprietary to Apple hardware.\\n\\nAs powerful as Microsoft\\'s become here, they\\'re still the little brother to IBM. This is not great news for Microsoft. On the other hand, it\\'s much better for them to be on the inside here with IBM working in bed with them than it would be to be on the outside looking in if IBM\\'s vision comes true and they recapture control of the PC ecosystem.\\n\\nBill, Microsoft, the company, and Steve too as the manager of the account with IBM, commit themselves to Microsoft is all in on this vision of the future of OS/2, and IBM is our horse in the race.\\n\\nBen: This is such a crazy part of the story to me, because we just talked about how Microsoft discovered this amazing business model. With everyone needing to license DOS from them, they\\'re taking over the world, and they\\'re becoming the standard development platform. Why on earth, if all that is true, are they going to develop some software that\\'s going to be locked to IBM computers?\\n\\nDavid: This is a recentralization attempt. Ballmer has this great, great, great quote about it. He says, \"This,” the IBM partnership at this time, “was what we used to call riding the bear. You just had to try to stay on the bear\\'s back and the bear would twist, turn, and try to throw you off. But we were going to stay on the bear because the bear was the biggest, the most important. You just had to be with the bear. Otherwise, you would be under the bear.\" That was IBM at this point in time.\\n\\nReally, I think it was IBM essentially putting a gun to Microsoft\\'s head and being like, well, you can be in bed with us on this future that we\\'re going to re-centralize everything, or you can be everybody else and not be, and you\\'ll lose.\\n\\nBen: Even though Microsoft\\'s doing all these little hedges, Windows, this tiny little team that\\'s 30 people or something, it\\'s not the most prestigious place at the company. The people in the applications division may as well be on another planet by this point from the systems division. They\\'re trying all kinds of crazy stuff. The company motto at this point is the next big thing is OS/2 and IBM, and we are the software vendor for that.\\n\\nDavid: Certainly Bill and I think Steve, too, they needed to tow the party line politically of expressing that, nope, OS/2 is the future. What we\\'re doing with Windows and with the Mac is those are small things within the company. It\\'s a super bizarre period in history, but IBM had also made a bit of a power play too with the later generations of the 16-bit era product they called the PC/AT. They used the Intel 286 chip instead of the Intel 386 chip. The 286 chip—this was an intentional decision on IBM\\'s part—was good, but it wasn\\'t great.\\n\\nBen: You say it was good, but not great. Bill Gates said it was brain dead.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Bill Gates called it a brain-dead chip.\\n\\nBen: I think you might be being charitable.\\n\\nDavid: I think it certainly was more powerful than the 8086, 8088, but it was nowhere near what the 386 could do. There\\'s a bunch of technical aspects to this, but the most important takeaway is that the 286 was not really powerful enough to do a graphical user interface or to power true multitasking in a way that the 386 and then later the 486 would be.\\n\\nA big part of actually the Compaq story about how Compaq and the clones leap ahead of IBM is they\\'re not deterred from coming out with 386 machines, which are way more powerful, can run Windows, can do all this stuff. That\\'s how they start to separate from IBM.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s right. That was a bet that company move where Microsoft was like, hey, Compaq, go make 386 stuff because we\\'re going to make a really great 386 software. We need someone to be all in on that because IBM\\'s not.\\n\\nDavid: This is the thing. Bill, Steve, and the company, they\\'re having to tow the party line of expressing commitment to IBM, but really they\\'re like, no, Compaq, go do the 386, we\\'re going to do Windows.\\n\\nBen: Right, they\\'re riling up the rebels.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. They are the rebels versus the empire here. Anyway, IBM, of course, sees all this. They made the decision not to go to 386 and to discourage it in the marketplace because they didn\\'t want PCs to start creeping into the core enterprise mainframe IBM workloads, their core business. If that was going to happen, they wanted it to be IBM proprietary closed system. I think that was a big part of the impetus for this OS/2 initiative.\\n\\nBen: I see.\\n\\nDavid: This is the empire strikes back here.\\n\\nBen: They\\'re basically trying to coop the PC movement back into IBM proprietary land.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. When OS/2 finally does come out in December 1987, predictably, as you can imagine here, it\\'s not very good. The market does not like it. Thank God for Microsoft. Again, this probably was Bill\\'s strategy all along that they hedged with Windows, with the Mac. That\\'s clearly the future. The market is not going to accept OS/2 and a recentralization on IBM. Microsoft\\'s just crushing it on the revenue side, even though OS/2 is a failure.\\n\\nBen: DOS and the applications were both great businesses by 1987.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Fiscal 1987, Microsoft does $350 million in revenue. Fiscal 1988, they do $600 million in revenue. Basically, none of this is from OS/2 and the IBM world. Towards the end of 1988 is when the wind starts really blowing away from IBM here.\\n\\nIn June of 1988, Microsoft hires Mike Maples, who is IBM\\'s director of software strategy away from IBM to come head Microsoft\\'s application software. What is Microsoft\\'s application software strategy right now? It\\'s the graphical user interface. It\\'s everything that IBM isn\\'t. The writing is starting to be on the wall here that divorce is coming between IBM and Microsoft.\\n\\nFinally, a year-and-a-half later in 1990, Windows 3.0 comes out. This is when they get it right. This is when there\\'s enough installed base of 386 and 486 machines out there in the open PC ecosystem that you can have a really good, true multitasking, good UI, graphical user interface running on top of DOS.\\n\\nWindows 1.0 and Windows 2.0 only ever achieved 5% penetration of the DOS installed base. Windows 3.0 doubles that in the first six months. PC Computing magazine writes about Windows 3.0. May 22nd, 1990 will mark the first day of the second era of IBM compatible PCs. Microsoft released Windows 3.0.\\n\\nOn that day, the IBM compatible PC, a machine hobbled by an outmoded character-based operating system and 70s style programs, was transformed into a computer that could soar in a decade of multitasking graphical operating environments, aka everything OS/2 is not. Windows 3.0 gets right what its predecessors got wrong. It drives adequate performance, it accommodates existing DOS applications, and it makes you believe that it belongs on a PC.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s awesome.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s what the press thought. Ben, I know you talked to a really important person in the Windows ecosystem and Microsoft internally at this time. What do you have for us?\\n\\nBen: We have to thank Brad Silverberg for helping us with this section. Brad led the Windows 3.1 team. He came in right after the 3.0 release and would eventually go on to lead the Windows 95 effort as the VP of the Personal Systems Division.\\n\\nBrad comes in, Windows 3.0 has just shipped. The first thing that is super, super obvious is as Brad observed everything going on with OS/2 land and everything going on with the core Microsoft culture, it was a complete clash. It was impossible for the pace of Microsoft. This is a super young group, all in their 20s. Some people in their 30s, but mostly 20s who just want to push the cutting edge, ship stuff.\\n\\nThink about Google in the early 2000s, just hire all the smartest people you can, set them loose, have creativity, and bump up against the edge of what\\'s possible, both in terms of pushing the hardware, but also pushing even laws as we would later see. Let\\'s just do what users love and see what happens. Let\\'s just do what technology enables us to do and see what happens. That\\'s the opposite of IBM\\'s culture at this point. There\\'s this huge cultural rift between what IBM needs and who Microsoft is at this point.\\n\\nWhat ended up happening with 3.0, it was unexpectedly loved. Microsoft was not really prepared for how much people were going to love the GUI, and with 3.1 it got really good. There was a small off site of the executives, and Bill and Steve basically decided that it was time to bet on Windows. That was the new strategy. Windows had always been plan B, and now suddenly it was plan A.\\n\\nWhen I say plan B, I don\\'t mean thought they had a prayer of being plan A. It was 65 people that shipped windows 3.1. These were the misfits. It was not prestigious. The prestigious thing to work on at Microsoft was OS/2 and eventually Windows NT. But the Windows team in the Windows 3.0 era is almost the Mac team over at Apple. They were flying the rebel flag, they valued creativity over bureaucracy, even if it meant they weren\\'t working on the prestigious thing.\\n\\nSuddenly, there\\'s this huge strategic opportunity to become the standard independent of IBM if the platform is good enough, and then boom. The early reception to Windows is so good, it gives this glimmer of, that may seem really ambitious, but that opportunity is actually ours if we want to go seize it. Everyone took a big gulp and said, the GUI\\'s the next big thing, users love this, let\\'s take the ragtag group and promote them.\\n\\nDavid: This was, I think, the moment when Microsoft started to believe in themselves, really. If you look at the facts as we told the story, it was like, Bill did this great business deal with IBM, anticipated the rise of the clones in the first PC, won, and then Microsoft now was the thing, and IBM was the old thing. It wasn\\'t until this. In this whole OS/2 thing, I think you can see, they felt like they were still little brother. They had to go along with what IBM dictated. Now they\\'re like, whoa.\\n\\nBen: Why do we again?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, we\\'re in control.\\n\\nBen: The press is making a big deal out of Bill Gates. Boy Wonder, he\\'s the youngest ever billionaire at age 31. By the way, when Bill Gates became a billionaire, there were not lots of billionaires, there were 50 billionaires. All this lore around the company, it\\'s like they can do no wrong. But inside the company, I think they\\'re like, we don\\'t know the future of technology. Any wave could break against us at any moment, and this is all tenuous. I think that chasm kept getting wider and wider and wider of internally feeling like they\\'re screwed and externally it\\'s seeming this is the next great thing.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I\\'ve got some fun stats on money and revenue around all this. In fiscal 1990, the year that Windows 3.0 shipped, Microsoft does $1.2 billion in revenue, making them the first software company ever to pass a billion dollars in revenue. Fiscal 1991, they do $1.8 billion. Fiscal 1992, they finally win the Apple copyright lawsuit around the GUI.\\n\\nBen: By the way, the way that they won that, a judge basically looked at the paper and said, Apple, you totally said in all the future versions of Windows, they can use your UI paradigms. For most of the counts, they\\'re covered. For these other things that you\\'re trying to ask them about, those are not actually defensible. It\\'s just widely accepted that these are UI paradigms now, and you can\\'t enforce any ownership over those. It basically got thrown out. Apple tried to appeal all the way up to the Supreme Court, who said no.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s right. Like we\\'ve been saying too, they both stole from Xerox.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Fiscal 1992 though, this is when Microsoft just blows the doors off. They do $2.8 billion in revenue in fiscal 1992, up from $1.8 the year before. That year, 1992 in October is when Gates finally passes John Kluge—Acquired OG fans, back to the LVMH episode—Gates passes John Kluge of Metromedia fame, media mogul to become the wealthiest person in America. Everything you\\'re talking about, all the press comes around that.\\n\\nIn January 1993, the crowning moment happens. Microsoft passes IBM in market cap. They have inherited the earth. They have inherited computing. Supposedly. I don\\'t know if this is 100% true. This is written in one of the books I read. I read this. The folks involved will have to confirm or deny.\\n\\nSupposedly, the next month after Microsoft passes IBM in market cap—we\\'re now in February 1993—the IBM board is in disarray. The empire is going down. They fired the CEO. Tom Murphy of Capital Cities fame who is on the IBM board, supposedly comes out to Redmond to sit down with Bill and personally ask him to come and be the next CEO of IBM.\\n\\nBen: No way.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This is what I read. I don\\'t know if this actually happened, but this is what I read.\\n\\nBen: Is that in Hard Drive?\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s in Hard Drive, yeah.\\n\\nBen: Wow. Listeners, there are some unauthorized biographies that we tried to corroborate as many of the facts as we can. But the ones where David\\'s saying he doesn\\'t know a source, it\\'s these unauthorized ones.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Gates obviously declines that. Whether or not that actually happened, spiritually, you could believe that happened. Bill and Microsoft are the new emperor here. This carries through to this day. We\\'re going to tell in the next episode here, the antitrust, the fall, and all that, but not really. Microsoft\\'s still the most valuable company in the world. They inherited the throne from IBM. It happens right here.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s nuts. Suddenly, Microsoft feels the full weight of everything that you have to do to build a platform and be a steward of an ecosystem. Suddenly, this huge effort began to try and make developers successful. That\\'s how Windows would be successful if it was a great platform for application developers to thrive on.\\n\\nCameron Myhrvold led the developer relations group basically to try and figure out, what do people want out of a platform, and how do we provide the APIs for them, the support, and everything in order to do that, all the documentation, all the help, everything? At the same time, Microsoft basically knew establishing a platform is brutal and requires bootstrapping a multi sided network of developers, users, and PC manufacturers.\\n\\nSo 3.1 had users excited, but it was still very early. They could have lost that throne. Developers were not really yet targeting Windows. Microsoft had to show, we make great applications for Windows, too. The applications group really had to start doing Windows 3.1.\\n\\nDavid: Right, because developers were targeting DOS at this point. They were probably preparing for OS/2. Some of them were targeting the Mac, Microsoft itself, but nobody was targeting Windows.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. You\\'ve got this big developer relations group effort that spins up. Meanwhile, there\\'s a huge push with OEMs to get them to install Windows. At this point, they were still installing DOS or some people were actually installing nothing and requiring users to put operating systems on. There\\'s a conceded push to get the OEMs to install 3.1.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and there are some people installing nothing. We should mention here, around this same time, this era, they move a lot of their OEM deals to a per processor licensing fee arrangement, which gets them in a lot of hot water with antitrust a few years later.\\n\\nBen: Okay, this happened from 1988 to 1994. David, explain the per processor licensing agreement.\\n\\nDavid: Here\\'s how Microsoft (I think) would position it to their OEM partners. You could pay us a license fee for every machine you ship with DOS installed on it, or DOS and Windows. You can offer other OSes too. But rather than that arrangement, we\\'ll give you a cheaper per unit deal because you\\'re going to ship DOS on everything. DOS is the standard, and we want Windows to be the standard, and Windows is going to be the standard.\\n\\nWe\\'ll make it more economically attractive to you, give you a lower per unit rate. If we just change the terms and say, instead of every unit you ship with, DOS or with Windows, every machine you ship, period, every microprocessor based machine that you ship, no matter what operating system is installed on us, just pay us a per processor rate. If you do that, you\\'ll be paying us for every machine, whether you ship DOS or Windows on it or not, but you\\'re going to ship DOS and Windows anyway.\\n\\nBen: You may as well take the cheaper rate.\\n\\nDavid: You may as well take the cheaper option. Obviously, what effect does this have on competition? There\\'s now a very, very, very strong incentive never to ship any other operating system.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Basically, you\\'re going to pay for two different operating systems, even though you\\'re only putting one on if you ever load a different operating system on. Yes, it very strongly incentivizes you to never ever ever ship any other operating systems on your computers as a company.\\n\\nThis is of course the way that regulators would look at it in 1994. That would get Microsoft in some hot water, and they had to agree to stop doing this practice. The way Microsoft would look at it is, we\\'re just helping our customers. Do you really think that these companies want to keep a whole separate ledger of what machines they shipped DOS on or Windows on versus what machines they shipped period? Wouldn\\'t it just be easier if once a month or once a quarter, they could just report to us their total shipments like they have to report to their investors anyway, and then we\\'ll just send them an invoice for all their machines?\\n\\nDavid: Totally. While antitrust and the government would seize onto this as a smoking gun, I think the reality is this was irrelevant in terms of the forces that made DOS and Windows the winners. They were already the winners by the time they started doing this.\\n\\nBen: If this had happened earlier, you could see how this would be more of a compelling way to get market share. But by the time they started doing it, they were already running away with the market.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Speaking of this new customer-friendly, buyer-friendly business practice from Microsoft, which I think is how they thought about it...\\n\\nBen: Totally. They wanted to make the stuff that people wanted to use the most, and that\\'s how they would win. Their goal was make the very best products, the best software we possibly can in the ways that people want to use and buy software, and then we\\'ll make a bunch of money.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. As this changing of the guard is happening from IBM to Microsoft, I think part of this new self confidence from Microsoft is, wait a minute, why can\\'t we go win the enterprise too and take that from IBM? We don\\'t have to get in bed with them to sell to the enterprise. We should sell to the enterprise.\\n\\nBen: The thing they were realizing is, well, we have made software that people like to use, so they\\'re using it in businesses. They always wanted that to be the goal, but now it was happening. People are doing their work in Excel. People are bringing PCs to the office.\\n\\nMaybe businesses are buying their PCs, but people are actually buying them themselves and using them in the office. It just made them that much more efficient. Microsoft really had to figure out how to sell to businesses, but we actually have no idea how to do that. It sounds crazy today. The Microsoft you know today, as late as the mid-90s, really had no idea how to sell or build software for businesses.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. This is the first half of the original Microsoft vision statement coming true, a PC on every desk and in every home. Desk means work, means enterprise. In this era, everybody we talk to, gives 100% of the credit to Steve Ballmer.\\n\\nSteve took it on his shoulders at this point in time when Microsoft is passing IBM to say, I am going to build, and we are going to learn as a company how to sell to enterprises. Ben, like you\\'re saying, it\\'s impossible to imagine now Microsoft not like this, but there\\'s so much that they needed to do that they didn\\'t have.\\n\\nBen: In part because prior to this, personal computers were not used by enterprises. It was just not an enterprise tool. Now that it was happening, Microsoft had to figure out how to be the ones that would benefit from it.\\n\\nDavid: That meant selling to the C-suite at global Fortune 500 companies, most of whom did not use computers.\\n\\nBen: Correct. Certainly, it didn\\'t want to buy operating systems one at a time.\\n\\nDavid: Right. To the extent, members of the C-suite like CIOs or proto IT organizations used computers or were the computing centers in the company, they hated the PC. It made their life hard. This was when employees would bring a PC to work, plop it down on their desk, and start mucking around with stuff. It made things hard.\\n\\nBen: And there really isn\\'t yet a business server that couples nicely with the PC on the desk. You have this weird thing where there\\'s a mainframe that is where the company\\'s real enterprise applications run, but people are bringing PCs. Those PCs don\\'t actually communicate well with anything else yet. They just are there for the employee to do their own work on a spreadsheet or something, print it out because finally 3.1 had printer drivers, and then deliver that. But it wasn\\'t a system that operated with other systems in your enterprise.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s no email. This really was a business transformation task for the global Fortune 500.\\n\\nBen: It wasn\\'t like, hey, let\\'s sell something to businesses that they want to buy. It\\'s, hey, let\\'s convince businesses that PCs are a good idea for their workforce to adopt.\\n\\nDavid: This was partnering with the consulting firms. This was building a direct sales force within Microsoft. This is building an indirect sales force within Microsoft to partner with distribution partners, with channel partners, with independent software vendors. This is building a customer service organization. This is building the executive briefing center on the Microsoft campus, and bringing CEOs and other C-suite folks there to Microsoft. It\\'s building solutions for them, it\\'s becoming a partner. It\\'s everything that Steve is frankly just born to do.\\n\\nBen: All of this stuff is pretty out of scope for this episode, including all the software systems you would need to build for the enterprise like Windows NT server, Exchange, SQL server, and Active Directory, the classic mid-2000s Microsoft stuff that they got known for. That is what this would all evolve into, and it really just started with everyone looking at Steve and saying, can you figure this out?\\n\\nWe\\'ve all to date basically just been either running dev teams, running marketing, or running product groups, and been selling through retail or distributors in the application side or mostly through OEMs on the systems and operating system side. But can you go figure out how to sell everything we make in a completely different way to a completely different buyer profile and keep us posted on how that needs to change all the products we make in order to do that? That\\'s a pretty crazy change.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. How it actually goes down, and we heard this from Steve and you heard it from other people, is so fitting. By the end of 1990, the Microsoft-IBM divorce is official. IBM takes full control of OS/2 development back from Microsoft. Microsoft ceases involvement. The breakup is official. This now gives Microsoft and Steve hunting license in the enterprise to go compete against IBM, but they have a secret weapon that is going to enable them to come take the enterprise from IBM. Ben, tell us what it is.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s painfully obvious. It\\'s Microsoft Office, and it\\'s the fact that the whole workforce is already using Microsoft Office. Everyone loves to talk about product-led growth and how it\\'s this new thing in the late 2010s, how Slack, Atlassian, Trello, and everyone figured out PLG. This bottoms-up workforce-adopted way, rather than selling to procurement, IT, or the central administrator. And it\\'s just not new.\\n\\nDavid: No. This has always been the case, and Microsoft invented it.\\n\\nBen: All the employees wanted to use Excel and Word. They were doing it anyway. At some point Microsoft needed to figure out how to take advantage of selling it centrally and how you do business with other businesses, rather than selling a zillion retail copies of people who are using it illegally for their work.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s so many things that are beautiful about this. It\\'s the legacy of this bet on the Mac, bet on Excel, and bet on Windows shortly thereafter, that enables Microsoft to go into the enterprise because even though they\\'ve just broken up with IBM and OS/2 isn\\'t going anywhere, it\\'s not like Steve can just go knock on the door of some banking CEO or C suite and be like, I\\'m Microsoft, come talk to me about how you\\'re going to use Microsoft products in your organization. But rather it\\'s like, hey, thousands of people in your organization are already using Excel. Let\\'s have a conversation about how we can make that work better for your organization, and what else Microsoft can do for you.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely. Next episode is going to be all about the enormous success of becoming an enterprise company, the enterprise agreement, cloud, and everything that came after that. But we have two chapters left in this episode, and they happen concurrently within the systems group by two very, very different teams, and that is Windows 95 and Windows NT.\\n\\nDavid, let\\'s start with NT, and then our little cherry on top can be 95 to close us out. How did Windows NT happen?\\n\\nDavid: Perfect, and it\\'s intertwined with the beginning of all this enterprisification of Microsoft. Okay, Windows NT. Remember, IBM\\'s whole goal with OS/2 was that they saw the trajectory of the PC was going to eat into traditional mainframe type applications in the enterprise. They wanted to recentralize and own the PC enterprisification of workloads. NT is, after the divorce, Microsoft being like, screw that we\\'re going to do the same thing and eat your lunch.\\n\\nThe initial work starts out of the work they had been doing on OS/2 with IBM. But then in October 1988, as they\\'re heading towards divorce, Microsoft hires Dave Cutler away from DEC. Dave is an absolute beast and legend. He\\'s still writing code at Microsoft today, which is amazing.\\n\\nBen: Isn\\'t that crazy? He\\'s in his 80s.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing. Dave at DEC wrote the whole operating system that DEC ran on VAX. Poaching him away to come work at Microsoft, he\\'s the guy that\\'s going to build an enterprise-ready, take share away from the way traditional enterprise computing is done onto the PC. He\\'s got the chops to do this, he\\'s also got the credibility to do this.\\n\\nBen: He\\'s written a widely-deployed enterprise operating system.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Him coming to Microsoft, him leading and building this effort, gives Steve and the sales force so much legitimacy when they\\'re going in and talking to the C-suites, the CIOs, the IT departments, and enterprises.\\n\\nBen: Even though they don\\'t yet have an enterprise product to sell, they\\'ve got DOS and early Windows, which is essentially consumer-targeted, but now they\\'ve got this guy, Dave.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, now they\\'ve got Dave.\\n\\nBen: We should say, this is really the first time they brought in someone who had real industry experience. In 1988, Microsoft was 13 years old, so Bill Gates would have been 33. Everyone is in their late 20s and early 30s, and Dave\\'s mid-40s. He\\'s like, you know I\\'ve seen a few things.\\n\\nDavid: I think it was Dave and also Mike Maples coming from IBM too. Mike obviously wasn\\'t a technical leader but on the business and strategy side, too. NT, we\\'ll talk a lot more about it on the next episode. But spoiler alert, it is the vision of what IBM wanted OS/2 to be, but it\\'s Microsoft\\'s version of it.\\n\\nBen: It enables all of your desktop computers at the company to join and network together in a compliant way. It enables an internal server that everything communicates with. It enables a directory of all the devices on the network and all the people in your organization.\\n\\nDavid: Soon with the Internet coming, it\\'ll enable servers that face externally from your company. The punchline here is that NT becomes the seeds of Windows Server, the business line, which become the seeds of Azure today.\\n\\nBen: The other important takeaway on NT is it was going to take a long time to build. It was going to take a long time to test. It was going to take a long time to sell and deploy, and it was going to have really strict requirements for what it could work on because it\\'s a power hungry operating system built for enterprise IT administrators. That is not your short-term product strategy. That is a long-term bet that a team is going to work on concurrently while you\\'re figuring out what to do after Windows 3.1.\\n\\nIn 1991, Bill Gates sums this up in a memo where he says, “Our strategy is Windows. One evolving architecture, a couple of implementations, and an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others.” Every word in that sentence does a bunch of heavy lifting.\\n\\nYou got one architecture. Okay. I think what that basically ends up meaning a few years later is one application programming interface (API) that developers can target so that when they want to write a Windows app, it works on both NT and whatever the evolution of 3.1 is. That\\'s one architecture, but it says one evolving architecture. That buys Microsoft a little bit more fluidity in the one architecture that\\'s being targeted.\\n\\nThen you hear a couple of implementations. This basically says, even though developers are targeting what became the Win32 API, the one way that we write applications, there are two different implementations. For many years, they would display very differently on NT systems versus—spoiler alert—Windows 95, the successor to Windows 3.1.\\n\\nDavid: By Windows 95, you mean Windows 4 that was supposed to ship in 1993?\\n\\nBen: Yes, I do, but it\\'s so much sexier to say Windows 95 and name it after the year that it actually ships. Yes, an immense number of great applications from Microsoft and others sheds light on the DRG (Developer Relations Group) strategy. We got to go out and be massive evangelists, and everyone in the systems group is looking over at the apps group going, did you see that? Bill Gates just said our strategy is Windows. We\\'re now the Windows company, and that includes great applications from Microsoft and others.\\n\\nWhat does that mean, applications group? Let\\'s go first and best on Windows, get to it. I just think that sentence says it all for what we\\'re looking at 1991 through call it 2000 or so.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. We just spent a bunch of time talking about the enterprisification and all the amazing enterprise stuff that the seeds get sewn from Microsoft at this point in time. This era is also the heyday of the consumer PC. In 1993, Jensen starts NVIDIA, graphics cards are becoming a thing. PC gaming is becoming an industry. You can even look at Minesweeper as being a seminal moment in terms of the consumerization, these devices, these personal computers becoming companions to people\\'s lives like the phone is today. You\\'ve got CD-ROM technology, multimedia, Encarta. The heyday of the consumer PC is here in this era.\\n\\nBen: Totally. Even before Windows 95 shipped, they had 75 million Windows users. This is even before you get plug-and-play, multimedia, or networking. This is on Windows 3.1. Crazy.\\n\\nWe\\'ve been leading up to what we\\'ve been building hype, Windows 95, or should I say Chicago? The Chicago name, for those of you out there who were paying attention when this was under development, and you were all excited about what Windows 95 would become—and it\\'s probably 1% of our audience or something who knows the Chicago code name—they wanted to create an OS for the everyman, one that was easy to get to, a nice quality of life when you\\'re there, it was affordable. Chicago is the perfect name in every way. It is also a contrast to what was going on in a different part of Microsoft, where there was the codename of Cairo for a very ambitious next generation operating system.\\n\\nMind you, NT had already come out in 1993. Cairo is this general bucket of maybe it\\'s post-NT, maybe it\\'s part of NT, but this is a really sophisticated, crazy set of technologies that we\\'re going to eventually bake into an operating system. It doesn\\'t really have a release date. No one really believes in any of the release dates that are proposed.\\n\\nThe Windows 95 team, the Windows 4 team, the Chicago team, loved contrasting this idea of a far flung land that\\'s really ambitious. Who knows what it\\'ll actually be like? Chicago is something we know quite well. You get on I-90 from Seattle, you drive for three days, and you\\'re there. That is the goal. That\\'s the spiritual thing about Windows 95.\\n\\nDavid: Pizza, the bears, the cubs.\\n\\nBen: 100%. We should say, Cairo never shipped, so there\\'s a lesson in that.\\n\\nDavid: Might as well been called Oz.\\n\\nBen: Or Longhorn.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Okay, all right, we\\'re getting ahead of ourselves.\\n\\nBen: We are getting ahead of ourselves. Windows 95, let\\'s start with the launch event itself. It was a huge, ridiculous, insane day in Redmond, Washington. They set up tents all over Microsoft\\'s campus. They flew in journalists, beta testers. There was a movement around Windows 95 in a way that you would not believe. It was an operating system launch, and Jay Leno launched it. It wasn\\'t like Jay Leno did some stand up, it was Jay Leno for 90 minutes in a tightly scripted environment, co-hosted with Bill Gates all of the fanfare and festivities.\\n\\nDavid: There is no other word to describe the Windows 95 launch besides glorious. I am so glad that this stuff is preserved on the Internet and on YouTube, and that we could experience it ourselves over the past month.\\n\\nBen: It might be the peak moment of pure joy to celebrate technology before a lot of the skepticism came in and the tech haters.\\n\\nDavid: The DOJ.\\n\\nBen: Totally. It was unabashed celebration of software is probably the best way to put it. Microsoft license Start Me Up famously from the Rolling Stones.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s amazing, a software company licensed Start Me Up by the Rolling Stones as the official theme song of an operating system. The idea that this would be happening, certainly back in 1975 when they were moving to Albuquerque, but even just a couple of years earlier, this is breaking new ground.\\n\\nBen: Totally. The other thing that\\'s happening in 1995 is the Internet hype is starting to build, but we will table that for next episode. Right at this point in history, only 14% of Americans had internet access. It was still very early, so there was no guarantee that any story posted online would actually reach the masses. Microsoft had really relied on traditional broadcast coverage of this event, and brought in all these journalists, all these print magazines, and all these newspapers to build the hype.\\n\\nI watched the whole keynote yesterday. At the end, they ripped down the back of the tent behind the stage. There\\'s the entire development team in the red, yellow, green, and blue squares of the Windows logo sitting outside on the big sports field on Redmond\\'s campus. There\\'s only 360 people that built Windows 95, so it\\'s still a small team, but they\\'re all there. They\\'re fired up. They\\'re part of the moment. That\\'s the launch event in Redmond, at least.\\n\\nAround the world, people are lined up around the block to buy an operating system. There\\'s a lot of news coverage of that. It was basically the iPhone launch of its day. They lit up the CN Tower, the Tower of London. This date, August 24th, 1995, they basically treated an operating system launch the way that you would launch a movie or a new Madonna album. It was a marketing case study, so much so that the folks from Coca-Cola actually reached out to Microsoft to ask them, how do you do marketing this well in the new age?\\n\\nDavid: To the Bill Gates quote with the Warren Buffett talk at U-Dub.\\n\\nBen: Yes. This is a company that freaking invented Santa Claus to sell us all sugar water, and they\\'re calling Microsoft asking, how do you market in this new era? It was that successful. They launched concurrently worldwide in eight languages. This thread that Microsoft had of early international continued all the way through to this moment. They invested heavily in doing all of the localization and help stuff so that the whole world really could adopt something all at one time. It really was the perfect product at the right time, the Internet, games, all of that.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s so much about Windows 95 too that I\\'m sure you\\'re going to get into, but the start menu. It was so perfect because this was the peak of the PC going fully mainstream. Nobody had ever treated software like this before.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s the takeaway. They thought about software in a completely different way. Yes, the start menu, while it got cluttered, complicated, and messed up over time, the idea of a button that you click to start using your computer was very appealing to people.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. The Mac obviously shared a lot of these elements, but it was at so much a smaller scale.\\n\\nBen: The Mac just never had any real PC penetration. From the IBM PC forward, it never had big market share.\\n\\nDavid: This was your grandmother coming into the digital world.\\n\\nBen: That is how they tried to market it. They market it as people on job sites using Windows. They marketed it as people doing crafts. There\\'s someone who\\'s modeling something for an F1 car. It\\'s just fun watching all these old videos and seeing all the different personas.\\n\\nDavid: Computer companies love F1 cars for demos. It\\'s the ultimate aspirational demo.\\n\\nBen: I must say this all pains me deeply as someone who never owned a PC, grew up using a Mac, loved every bit of my Mac. I was even an apologist in the OS-9 era of this isn\\'t very good, but I\\'m still going to say it\\'s good. I was on the OS-10 public beta. I only clicked a start menu when I was fixing a teacher\\'s computer at school. Even though the takeaway here is everyone thought this was a great operating system and it won the market, I always looked at it like, well, it\\'s not a Mac.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s how Mac users always look at Windows.\\n\\nBen: The way that Apple products became mainstream always felt odd to me as someone who was using them when they weren\\'t, but it\\'s been interesting gaining a new appreciation for Microsoft through studying their history that I absolutely did not have as a user during this era.\\n\\nDavid: Having this discussion now makes me think, Windows 95, they did what Apple tried to do in bringing Scully in. Scully came from Pepsi. Obviously, that didn\\'t work, but Microsoft, they\\'re the ones who did it. They\\'re the ones who mass-marketified the computing vision.\\n\\nBen: It was the wrong strategy for Apple, and it was the right strategy for Microsoft. Apple has always, at least in my opinion, created a better computing experience by being completely integrated. It\\'s the Alan Kay quote, \"Anyone who cares about making great software needs to build their own hardware.\" The complete integrated package that Apple offers, I have always found to be the best computing experience. And it doesn\\'t scale.\\n\\nDavid: It didn\\'t in that era for sure.\\n\\nBen: In that era, yeah. The way to scale is Make the software that is going to get distributed on the most PCs, and then that is the most interesting to software developers. It is the most interesting to consumers who want the software and IT buyers who want to buy the standard thing. Apple\\'s strategy versus Microsoft strategy in this era, Apple was always going to be a bit player rather than the scale winner.\\n\\nThe trade off is lots of PCs had blue screens of death, Apple never had blue screens of death. Where do blue screens come from? It\\'s driver problems. It\\'s that the printer is not speaking the same language as your particular computer and what the operating system knows about your computer, and are the device drivers right for your particular version of whatever\\'s on your motherboard? Apple never had those issues, but they also had very few units shipped and much more expensive product.\\n\\nDavid: Sidebar. That Alan Kay quote about if you really care about software, you do your own hardware, makes so much more sense to me now having done this episode, because he\\'s coming from having made the Alto and the graphical interface there. The only way that he could have made the GUI on the Alto was basically building a mini computer.\\n\\nBen: Isn\\'t that crazy?\\n\\nDavid: It makes so much more sense now.\\n\\nBen: A little bit more on Windows 95 before we finish the story here, it is remarkable to reflect that it took 5–6 years to go from Windows\\' plan B to Microsoft being extremely right that that was the franchise, that was the bet to bet the entire company on.\\n\\nAs Brad Silverberg put it this way to me, he said, Windows 95 cemented Windows as the franchise product for Microsoft, which interestingly it was not yet. David, this is crazy. It would remain the franchise product for the next 20 years, perhaps 5 or 10 years too long, but we\\'ll save that story.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Just to put some numbers on this, August 24th, 1995 is the launch event, the glorious day. Windows 95 comes out. It sells a million copies in the first week, seven million copies in the first month.\\n\\nFiscal 1995—this is the 12 months ending in June before Windows 95 comes out—Microsoft did $5.9 billion in revenue. Fiscal 1996, they did $8.7 billion. Fiscal 1997 when Windows 95 is really going, they do $12 billion in revenue. First software company to pass $10 billion in revenue, already the most valuable company in the world. They are a monster. There is no other way to put it.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s crazy. From a product perspective, there was just so much really got smoothed here. This was a user experience where they finally had time to think, what actually do users want to do with an operating system? What features should be part of the OS, and what should we delegate to applications? What are modern networking technologies that we should bring in?\\n\\nI don\\'t want to foreshadow too much, but how should the Internet be in a modern operating system? That was a huge thing. The multimedia, the video stuff. An operating system really showed up and said, we thought about this experience for you. You\\'re looking for where to start, you\\'re looking for cool stuff to do, and you\\'re looking for it to not break on you. We now finally have a complete story around all of that.\\n\\nA couple of interesting technical notes, it was basically all new technology. If you try to look this up, it will tell you, Windows 95 was DOS-based. It still used DOS in fallback situations for older DOS applications or drivers. But for most of the time, it was no longer true that Windows was just an operating environment on top of the DOS operating system.\\n\\nWindows had now become a true 32-bit operating system of its own. Windows did all the heavy lifting. It had its own file system. It accomplished a lot of the user experience magic and speed that it was praised for by rewriting a lot of this from scratch. This was the beginning of Windows as its own OS. You can see that actually change in the marketing messages that change from operating environment to operating system.\\n\\nDavid, that brings us to the end of our chapter one. We\\'ve got plenty of analysis here to do, but my God, what a first 20 years for the company.\\n\\nDavid: We knew this was going to happen. This is why we waited 10 years into Acquired\\'s life to cover Microsoft. It\\'s the most important company in the world still today.\\n\\nIt was so fun researching, going back and doing all this because there are so many different perspectives, and so much has been written. I don\\'t know if we\\'ve gotten it right here, but I feel like every other major attempted storytelling at this has not gotten it right. Getting to go talk to all the people who were part of this...\\n\\nBen: Yeah, living in Seattle is quite helpful.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. We really got that sense of like, there\\'s still a story to be told here. It\\'s never been more relevant again than today. All that to say, I\\'m glad we waited 10 years.\\n\\nBen: And there\\'s all this stuff we miss. I didn\\'t mention Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research was a lot of people and a lot of money.\\n\\nDavid: Microsoft tried to buy Intuit too along the way. That got canned.\\n\\nBen: Actually, the start of research is interesting. I\\'ll say this real quick. In 1991, Nathan Myhrvold started Microsoft Research, and the logic is fascinating. Basically, everything Microsoft had done until that point was taking things from mainframes and mini computers, and adapting those tasks, those jobs to be done for personal computers.\\n\\nAt some point, they looked around and said, all right, well, we did it. All the personal and business applications can now be run on personal computers, so we have to come up with uses for future technologies in order to continue to drive the ecosystem forward. There\\'s no more low hanging fruit. I thought that was an interesting thesis of why to spin up a research division at that point in history.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Let\\'s move into analysis.\\n\\nBen: Okay, great. Playbook. The big interesting one that I want to start with, and it actually involves a chapter from the story that we just glossed over, is capital efficiency allows founders to control their own destinies in a way that you just don\\'t get when you\\'re selling off huge chunks of the company in order to accomplish your mission.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, I love this.\\n\\nBen: Let\\'s just talk through the cap table over time and how the company went public. We talked about the partnership being 64% Gates, 36% Paul Allen. In 1980, Steve Ballmer comes in and gets 8.5%, 8.75%, or something that percent of the company, so dilutes Gates and Allen down.\\n\\nIn 1981, just a year later, they take the VC investment for 5% of the company from TVI. This also, I\\'m guessing around 5% trying to reverse engineer some of the numbers. They also created an option pool, where they were then creating opportunity for basically rewarding management, which is how there were 10,000 millionaires created in the Seattle area from Microsoft.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s the amazing thing. The option pool doesn\\'t get created until late in Microsoft\\'s life. All those Microsoft millionaires only came from whatever size that was, 5% of the company or whatever.\\n\\nBen: At IPO, even with all this dilution, you\\'ve got the Ballmer dilution, the VC dilution, and the option pool dilution, Bill Gates still owned 49% of the company. That\\'s pretty unprecedented. He wasn\\'t the only one with a big chunk. Paul Allen owned 28% of the company. Steve had 7.5% of the company.\\n\\nThis company was basically owned by the three more or less co-founders. A little tiny option pool, and then a VC who ended up with 6.1%. I think Dave got some more shares from being on the board. You just don\\'t see companies that look this anymore.\\n\\nDavid: This is Bill\\'s company. This is their company in a way that no other company is these days. No venture-backed company going through the modern era is like that. By the time you get to be public, you may still be the largest shareholder as a founder or CEO, but it\\'s not your company, far from it.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely. I\\'m trying to figure out why they were able to be so capital efficient. Is it just that software was such an unbelievably good business model compared to everything else that existed? They didn\\'t need a lot of working capital, everything was high margin, they could grow really fast. Or it was just an era before much competition. They didn\\'t need to out-raise their competitors. Once they got a little bit ahead, there was really no way for anybody else to close the gap, assuming that they executed well.\\n\\nDavid: I totally think it\\'s the latter. I think it\\'s that the minimum fixed cost threshold to be that, in Bill\\'s words, slightly better than your competitors and get the positive spiral going, was low enough that it could be paid for just in Bill and Paul\\'s time and effort. There was that unique moment at the beginning of the software industry where that was true, and that would never be true again.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s so, so, so insane. There was no one else really with the knowledge either. Even if someone else came in with a big $1 million check and gave it to a competitor, in 1975, how many people could really write these language interpreters?\\n\\nDavid: You couldn\\'t buy the experience having written emulation software for microprocessors that Paul had.\\n\\nBen: They had an obsession and an obscure skill that turned out to be one of the most valuable in the world in an area where there was a freak law of nature in play with Moore\\'s Law that was so unintuitive, that you had to think from real first principles to understand the impacts of it.\\n\\nDavid: I think there are two freak laws of nature\\'s one. (1) There was Moore\\'s law that they were benefiting from. (2) There was the zero marginal cost of software.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true. It\\'s this complete perfect storm that enabled them to build a highly defensible business without really any investment ever. This is the largest company in the world, the most valuable company in the world that was entirely bootstrapped.\\n\\nDavid: Even though they raised money, not a single dollar of investment actually happened at this company.\\n\\nBen: No, and in 1986, when they actually did go public, they raised $45 million. They never spent that because they generated much more free cash flow than that that year.\\n\\nDavid: It was just a means to an end of getting public.\\n\\nBen: And they needed to for the reason that they had been granting so many stock options from that little option pool to employees that they were going to blow the SEC\\'s 500 shareholder cap. They projected 1987, so they wanted to go public on their own terms in 1986, not when they had to buy SEC rules.\\n\\nDavid: Also, Microsoft needed to be a public company. If you\\'re going to be an important company in the world at this scale, if you\\'re going to first ride the bear with IBM but then inherit the earth from IBM, you got to be a public company. You can\\'t be a private partnership. You\\'re not going to go have conversations with C-suites and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies if you are a private partnership in this era especially.\\n\\nBen: Maybe. I don\\'t know. I\\'d agree with you if you had a bunch of short-term capital interests that owned your company, but if it\\'s all founder-owned, there are great, large private companies in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, fair, true.\\n\\nBen: Coke Industries is a trusted company by a whole bunch of their customers. Cargill is even bigger than that. There\\'s a bunch of European industrial and shipping companies. Rolex. There are privately-held, big, important companies in the world.\\n\\nDavid: For sure, but none of those companies are Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true. That\\'s very fair. Especially getting to the stage that they eventually got to being the trusted partner to governments around the free world, that requires being a public company.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s funny. This playbook theme, this was a moment in time and a set of factors where this worked. I guess the lesson is find an industry in its infancy, be capital-efficient, and run the table.\\n\\nBen: That has unique economic conditions that have never existed before to create these magical businesses you could never fathom before this new technology thing existed? It\\'s an impossible thing to wish for. It may never happen again. We may never get another Google either.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s what I was going to say, it did happen again, it happened with Google.\\n\\nBen: But how many things can you collapse to zero? I think that\\'s the question. With Microsoft, they were able to collapse their marginal cost to zero, but they still had distribution costs, and then Google collapsed distribution costs to zero with the Internet. What\\'s a big cost that a company has now? Maybe AI will collapse. You no longer need 50,000 employees, you can have five employees. Maybe it can collapse that to zero.\\n\\nYou need something of that scale, which is, where does a company spend most of its money that suddenly it can spend no money on? I suppose actually it is on the human capital. You just look at big successful companies and look at what they spend money on. Those are the candidates.\\n\\nDavid: Good point. Still unlikely we\\'ll ever find another Microsoft opportunity.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Other fun things on the IPO, do you know who IPO\\'d the day before Microsoft did?\\n\\nDavid: No.\\n\\nBen: Oracle. Oracle had a nice pop, which actually helped Microsoft price a little bit higher in their IPO. That is another episode we have to do.\\n\\nAnother thing adds yet another layer to the insanity of everything that we\\'ve been talking about of why they were able to build such a successful company on such little capital, I don\\'t think there has ever been a tailwind in history like the one that Microsoft had with the secular growth of the personal computer wave. The only thing I can think of that is comparable is Amazon with the growth of the Internet, powering their early growth.\\n\\nHere\\'s the stat. From 1975 to 1986, 11 years prior to their IPO, so founding to IPO, PCs grew at a compound annual growth rate of 98%. It grew from 4000 units per year to 9 million units per year shipped. You can almost not mess up when you have a tailwind that.\\n\\nDavid: Especially when you are the linchpin player.\\n\\nBen: They managed to make themselves the point of integration for the whole industry. Oftentimes, I find myself when we\\'re looking at these companies that are among the most successful in the world or like Microsoft, the most successful in the world, it\\'s basically a multidimensional multiplication problem.\\n\\nThey had this unbelievable one in a zillion thing going for them, which you can multiply by this other one in a zillion multi thing. It\\'s the zero marginal cost, zero distribution cost, unbelievable secular growth of the PC, Moore\\'s law happening. They\\'re the single choke point for the whole industry. It\\'s just crazy how many things you multiply together, and of course it should end up in a number over three trillion.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. I\\'ll jump in with a playbook theme that we referenced a little bit in the episode, but we really got a highlight here. Bill, Steve, Paul, and everybody at Microsoft, were incredibly talented, incredibly smart. They saw the future in a way nobody else did, but they also were willing to hedge their bets.\\n\\nIt\\'s not like they just got everything right. They were going to get things wrong with OS/2, but they hedged the bets with Windows. I think that is such a key lesson of when you\\'re in a really dynamic market like this, in our ecosystem right now in tech, venture capital, startups, whatnot, people put so much value on conviction. I have conviction. This is what the future is going to be like. I think the Microsoft story is the opposite of that. They had conviction that software was going to be big.\\n\\nBen: And personal computers. Creating software for desktop computers was a really good idea, and they wanted to be the best at it.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, but the exact path of how that was going to play out, they had very little conviction and were willing to be very flexible.\\n\\nBen: You\\'re right. It\\'s both the hedging, but also then the ability to read the world and quickly, entirely change your strategy if you need to, and having your hedge be far enough along that you can jump quickly to it and shift your whole organization to get on board with it. That\\'s a hard leadership thing to do.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I can\\'t wait in the next episode to talk about the Internet tidal wave memo. That\\'s related to your playbook theme too. You can\\'t really do that if you don\\'t own 49% of the company, if it\\'s not your company.\\n\\nBen: Which I think you\\'re seeing play out with most CEOs today. There\\'s a big difference between a founder-CEO and the stuff that they can do. Zuckerberg with the metaverse or Jensen with betting the whole company and going all in again on AI versus Tim Cook or Sundar Pichai, certainly a very different type of CEO. Satya is interesting. Despite the fact that he doesn\\'t own half the company, he\\'s got a lot of founder-like control, which I think is pretty interesting.\\n\\nDavid: All right, don\\'t get ahead of ourselves.\\n\\nBen: Moving along. Other playbook themes, a big one that jumps out to me is that new generations of technologies enable market dislocations. Unless you are in a transformational moment in terms of a new technology came out that enables something that wasn\\'t possible before that\\'s going to rearrange the whole value chain and open up new markets, it\\'s pretty hard to go challenge an incumbent. No one was going to challenge IBM really until the microcomputer, even the minicomputer people. Did DEC really challenge IBM? Not really. It never made a dent.\\n\\nDavid: It wasn\\'t a full platform shift in the same way.\\n\\nBen: And there are these little blips of it. The GUI I think meaningfully reshuffled the DECs. Those are the moments where you can have meaningful new entrants. Otherwise, you have to bide your time and just build your hedges and see.\\n\\nRelated, even if you are the incumbent being disrupted, it is possible to have a very, very large and durable revenue stream that can go on for a very long time. What I\\'m referring to in this particular example is despite all of the dethroning that we just talked about, Microsoft would not eclipse IBM in revenue. You mentioned market cap, David, but in revenue until the year 2015. Isn\\'t that nuts?\\n\\nDavid: I intentionally didn\\'t look up revenue because it made the story muddier, but wow, there you go.\\n\\nBen: I think that\\'s the point. Microsoft\\'s perception by the market, I\\'m sure they were growing faster, I\\'m sure they had better gross margins. I\\'m sure there was a better story there, so there\\'s a multiple that comes out of the story. I\\'m sure there are lots of good reasons why Microsoft became more valuable than IBM very early, but IBM\\'s revenue did not peak until 2012. What?\\n\\nLong after public perception moves on, customers still get value from something created by incumbents for a very long time. I think that\\'s something we often forget about in the buzzy Twitterverse of like, oh that thing\\'s over. It might still grow for another 20 years before it\\'s over.\\n\\nDavid: That also just speaks to the nature of the enterprise business, too.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s a good point.\\n\\nDavid: IBM was the enterprise business. Today, Microsoft is the enterprise business.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true. Peloton revenue can dry up a lot faster than contracts for mainframes. What do you got?\\n\\nDavid: A playbook theme that I want to highlight that really, really came out in our conversations is Microsoft was not just a talent magnet, the talent magnet during the PC era. If you were an ambitious young person, this is where you wanted to be.\\n\\nIt was on every dimension. If you were an ambitious young technical person, that\\'s where you wanted to be. If you were an ambitious young salesperson, if you\\'re an ambitious young marketing person, that\\'s where you wanted to be.\\n\\nThey just had this culture there, which is so funny. We\\'ll talk in the next episode of how that culture really fell apart for a while there. I asked a lot of these early people that we talked to, what was it being there? You guys worked yourselves half to death. Were you mad about that? Did you resent it? Were you just making Bill rich? They\\'re all like, no. Yeah, we neglected every other part of our life, but that was the good old days. This was the magic, we were making it happen.\\n\\nBen: That totally comes through. I asked Brad, why did Windows 95 work? There\\'s lots of structural reasons, but he said, we basically did two things. (1) We laid out principles for product and then pushed responsibility down. Developers were often their own PMs. There\\'s this idea of once you got the principles, we don\\'t need to write a zillion specs, design something three times, and pass it through three functions. You know the principles, make great software that follows the principles. (2) He said that everyone felt personally responsible for the product, and it really showed.\\n\\nDavid: Anybody you talked to from this era of Microsoft, this was their life\\'s work. No doubt about it.\\n\\nBen: Something we touched on a little bit is the benefit of scaling with OEMs. This was the contrast against Apple, where I said Apple was always going to be a niche player by the way that they designed, built, and packaged everything themselves. Apple is in many ways like the AmEx, where Microsoft is the Visa.\\n\\nOn our Visa episode, it just became so clear that Visa could quickly take over the world at MasterCard by being an open network, where they didn\\'t have to do all the work to scale themselves. They could distribute to a bank, partner with a bank, and then boom, each of the banks that was on their network could independently scale at their own rate, which created obviously compounding effects for how fast Visa and MasterCard could scale. The same can be said of Windows.\\n\\nDavid: Totally, the OEMs. Yeah.\\n\\nBen: I think the Microsoft OEM team for Windows was 20 people or something. Before the enterprise, in this era that we\\'re talking about, the group of people responsible for go-to market for Windows was really small. They sold some retail, but the team was just about, hey, make sure HP and...\\n\\nDavid: Compaq, Dell, and Gateway.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. That was their go-to market, and it makes your scaling unbelievably efficient.\\n\\nDavid: Dude, you\\'re getting a Dell.\\n\\nBen: Dude, you are getting a Dell. Similarly, I think the fact that they went international early was this very powerful constraint. It meant that every time they shipped software, they had to make it globally ready quickly. That meant that if there was any network effects to your software, anything becoming a standard, Microsoft was just way better positioned to become the standard than anyone else was.\\n\\nOn top of there being network effects, there\\'s also scale economies. A word processor is a word processor. The extent that you have customers in every country who can buy your one piece of software, you can amortize the development costs over a huge user base so much more quickly.\\n\\nDavid: 100%.\\n\\nBen: The fact that they forced themselves to be international early meant that every product after that also had to figure out how to do all the localization, training, and all of that to get all those effects too.\\n\\nDavid: No matter how much time, money, and resources you have to spend to localize Microsoft word into kanji, it\\'s a lot less time and resources and money than developing Microsoft word.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. They just realized that so early. They also realized that most people who were doing some localization would do a shoddy job. They would think about it as lesser than the US market. They just did a good job at localization. They just cared. They thought of it as this is a strategic pillar that in every country, everyone experiences our software to the same quality because it\\'s our brand everywhere. I don\\'t know. I just think that is not how the rest of the industry thought about it.\\n\\nDavid: Definitely not.\\n\\nBen: On top of all of this, the way that they executed it through subsidiaries was pretty genius. Redmond did not control international. They spun up country managers and subsidiaries in each of these countries in a ton of countries.\\n\\nWhile Redmond did the product development and then did the engineering work to do localization to all the strings files and everything for those countries, the actual marketing messaging, the sales strategy, and the sales structure, happened in country that was owned by a person who lived there so they actually could think through, what is the best way for people to receive this software here?\\n\\nAgain, that\\'s just going to yield way better results than if you\\'re sitting there armchair quarterbacking at Redmond thinking about how a person in Chile is going to receive your marketing message.\\n\\nOne other that I have is this one that we didn\\'t really talk about, but Microsoft famously was not first to market with basically any of their applications. They aren\\'t even really today in most cases. You think about the strategy that they had early on spreadsheets, word processing, all these were copycats at their outset.\\n\\nSometimes they would do an acquisition, but most of the time they just look at a product and say, huh, our software should do the same thing, and they would copy it. They had no shame in doing that. They had their eyes everywhere looking for good ideas, they had reverence for the good ones, and then they would just incorporate them.\\n\\nOn top of that, they wanted to make the software very easy to switch to. A lot of the keyboard shortcuts in Excel to this day are there because they were originally the Lotus 1-2-3 shortcuts. They wanted people to have the same muscle memory that just worked.\\n\\nFundamentally, what this does for you as a business is it just leads to better risk adjusted returns. You already know what\\'s going to work before you ship it. You don\\'t really take market risk. You\\'re not going to be the first to the market with early adopters, but most of the time, you actually don\\'t need to be to win.\\n\\nI think Microsoft own that idea. Most of the time people are sheepish about it. Steve Jobs famously said, Microsoft has no taste. I think that\\'s another way to put it that it\\'s copycatting.\\n\\nDavid: I do agree with the premise, with all of this. I think doing this episode though has made me think there\\'s a little more nuance to it. Yes. In broad strokes, you can say that\\'s what Microsoft strategy was with applications over the years, but the Microsoft versions never actually won until there was a platform shift that they could take advantage of to beat the incumbent.\\n\\nMicrosoft wasn\\'t going to beat Lotus 1-2-3 until the graphical paradigm came along, and then Excel being graphical was just obviously so much better. They tried with Multiplan, they failed. Multiplan was fine, but 1-2-3 was the winner.\\n\\nThe nuance to me is yes, but it\\'s more like with the resources of Microsoft and the timeframe that Microsoft can afford to have, they can afford to start building the application, start building the product, getting into market, start learning, be positioned that then when the paradigm shift comes, leap ahead.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s a good point. It\\'s also different. The Lotus 1-2-3–Multiplan thing, in that era, Microsoft just didn\\'t have great distribution yet. Lotus 1-2-3 just got pretty far ahead of them, and Microsoft had no way to catch up. A few years after that, that would basically never be true again.\\n\\nDavid: That could be true too.\\n\\nBen: I will say, you touched on something that\\'s an interesting corollary to this. Their first versions of software famously are not good. You look at Windows 1.0 and 2.0. They know that it\\'s part of the strategy, and they were world class at learning from customers and integrating customer feedback into subsequent versions.\\n\\nThere\\'s always this saying of Microsoft doesn\\'t have a very good first or second version, but the third version of something is typically pretty good. I think that fact pattern definitely follows.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'m curious your thoughts on this. I\\'m so surprised. One thing that you have not brought up yet on this episode is you were a PM at Microsoft for several years.\\n\\nBen: I was, but it was such a different era in that 2012–2014 era. I guess 2011 is when I started as an intern. I\\'ll have a lot of thoughts on it next episode.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, great. I\\'ve got one more playbook theme before we move on to power. Microsoft figured out software before anybody else, and they figured out so many aspects of what it means to be a software business before anybody else, but they figured out that software is never done.\\n\\nI do think a lot of their competitors, we didn\\'t obviously didn\\'t study Lotus to the same degree that we studied Microsoft here, we didn\\'t study WordPerfect, et cetera, but I think there was a mindset that a lot of other folks are like, you ship software, and then the software was done.\\n\\nThat was not the culture at Microsoft. This is related to what you were just saying. Shipping software is the beginning. You are always working on that software. You\\'re working on next versions and stuff, but even before the next version, the work of software is never done.\\n\\nBen: Of course, if you own the hardware, you definitely think of it more of like, well, we ship them, the big cabinet of things, we install it, and we fix it if it\\'s broken, but we\\'ve sold them hardware. The software is required to run it, but the thing we sold them is the hardware. If you\\'re a pure software company, you think about the world differently.\\n\\nYou\\'re like, well, I can always ship you another CD, another floppy disk, over the Internet. It\\'s obviously very different. But because there weren\\'t really software companies before them, of course people didn\\'t come from that mindset.\\n\\nDavid: I think you still see the legacy of this right to this day in Apple versus Microsoft. Apple still is on a yearly software release cadence, which is ridiculous. Whereas Microsoft is on the cloud, it\\'s all constant. It\\'s all constantly shipping. Look at AI, look at OpenAI. The software is never done so deeply in the software business model.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true.\\n\\nDavid: All right, should we move on to power?\\n\\nBen: Yes. Listeners who are new to the show, we do this section based on Hamilton Helmer\\'s seven powers framework. The question is, what is it that enables a business to achieve persistent differential returns, or to put in another way, to be more profitable than your closest competitor and do so sustainably?\\n\\nThe seven are counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs, network economies, process power, branding, and cornered resource. David, I am pretty sure I could make a case somewhere between 1975 and 1995 at Microsoft for all seven of these.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s one of the most defensible businesses they built in history, so of course they would have all seven of the powers.\\n\\nDavid: All right, let\\'s run through each of them and do a quick 45 seconds on each.\\n\\nBen: Great. Counter positioning. I think the biggest example of this comes through where Microsoft is basically willing to jump on the microcomputer revolution before the incumbents were. IBM did not want microcomputers to happen. When they started to happen, IBM tried to figure out how to slow it down and reintegrate it into their old business model.\\n\\nMicrosoft basically had no baggage. This is classic innovator’s dilemma stuff. They could say, well, we don\\'t need to make any money on hardware. We don\\'t need to even make hardware. We are free to become the whole point of integration for the entire ecosystem just by shipping bits. And that is crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Actually, related to that—I can\\'t believe we haven\\'t talked about this in the episode until now—Microsoft could enable other companies to be successful. You talk to Microsoft people, they always talk about themselves as a platform, like we\\'re a platform. Other companies grow on the back of Microsoft. That was not true for IBM. Totally not true.\\n\\nMicrosoft could make Compaq successful. Microsoft could make Lotus successful. Microsoft could make Intuit successful. Microsoft could make Netscape successful.\\n\\nBen: We keep talking about Microsoft as the point of integration, choke point, dependency, or standard for the whole ecosystem. Given that, it is quite remarkable how much value they created on top of the platform versus just captured for themselves. There\\'s that famous Bill Gates line, you want your ecosystem around you to be generating more revenue than you are taking for yourself. They did a ton of that. It\\'s the OEMs, and it\\'s the application developers.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s major counter positioning. Okay, that\\'s one.\\n\\nBen: Scale economies.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s everything we just talked about in Playbook.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s unbelievable. When Microsoft has an install base of 100 million people using Excel—in this episode, let\\'s just say 10 million people who are using Excel—and suddenly some up and coming spreadsheet comes out with a cool feature like auto sum, fill down, draw borders around the cells, or whatever, suddenly, Microsoft does a tiny bit of dev work. They can reap tons and tons and tons of value for doing that that the tiny company cannot do.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, great.\\n\\nBen: Fixed amount of dev work amortized across a large customer base.\\n\\nDavid: I don\\'t think we need to say any more on this. The whole episode\\'s about scale economies.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Switching costs. The funny thing about monopoly is there\\'s nothing to switch to.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s a good one. This one\\'s pretty related to network economies for me with this one of, okay, sure, you can switch to another operating system. Good luck getting other applications that you know and love to run on that.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, that\\'s the answer.\\n\\nDavid: Speaking of network economies, developers, applications, OEMs.\\n\\nBen: There\\'s not a classic network, Facebook, or AT&T style network here, in terms of one user can contact every other user, but more users being on Windows incentivizes more developers to make great applications for Windows, which enables Microsoft to sell more copies to more users, et cetera.\\n\\nDavid: Although, actually, I think once they start getting into the enterprise workplaces in general, organizations in general, there is the user network effect, like I want this Microsoft Word document that I just worked on for you to be able to open it and use it too.\\n\\nBen: You\\'re right. I didn\\'t even think about that. The document formats are a huge network effect thing, even before the Internet. Even before organizations were networked and computers were networked outside of an organization, file formats. You\\'re right, there are huge network economies to file formats.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and it\\'s inter-organizational too. If I\\'m a law firm, I want my clients to be able to open my Word docs.\\n\\nBen: Right.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, next.\\n\\nBen: Process power. This might be the weakest.\\n\\nDavid: As it so often is.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s elusive. This is a little bit later in history, but I did always think it was absolutely incredible when I was at Microsoft, and we would ship a version of Office every three years. I worked on Office 15. The entire 6000 person organization had a process in place, where we could release to manufacturing (RTM) on a date that we planned three years in advance and actually hit it.\\n\\nThe process of the ads cuts meetings, the zero bug bounce, the testing schedule, and the triage when you had things that people wanted to introduce late in the schedule. It was a remarkable product, especially with all these teams that needed all their code to interoperate.\\n\\nI worked on a shared experiences team that would check things and that would be a dependency. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, all of them took on the shared code. We knew our ship date three years in advance and would hit it. It\\'s crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. This exists. Especially by the time you get to the Windows 95 era at the end of this episode, it\\'s like RenTech. The amount of stuff and process within Microsoft, the device drivers, the middleware, the programming languages, the dev tools, the machine there to make all this computing work, there was a miracle that this stuff worked. You couldn\\'t just recreate that.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s funny. The process power, I would say, is stronger in Office than Windows. Now my colors are showing. Windows always notoriously miss their ship dates. I\\'m actually less sure that process power existed in that early days. I think they were a bunch of smart people, but I\\'m not sure that they had a unique way of creating software.\\n\\nDavid: I think that got built over time.\\n\\nBen: Agree.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, branding, for sure.\\n\\nBen: For sure.\\n\\nDavid: Don\\'t get fired for buying Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true. Windows 95 built a consumer brand. The idea of a consumer brand of operating systems was there was Apple, but they were tiny, and that was more around the hardware.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s both fronts. It\\'s their brand in the enterprise that is an amazing story that they built. They were branding consumer. The easiest to point to instantiation is the Rolling Stones and Jay Leno, but they had a software brand. Nobody had that.\\n\\nBen: But branding is probably the thing that they rely on the least interestingly enough. There are other structural reasons that they\\'re entrenched, where even if Microsoft had a crappy brand in this era, they probably still would have won. The magic of getting the whole deal with the IBM PC and then getting to sell licenses to all the other OEMs.\\n\\nDavid: That brings us to the last one, which I think is a super strong one at least in this era, cornered resource. DOS, full stop.\\n\\nBen: Yup. It didn\\'t start as a cornered resource, but as soon as IBM started shipping it on the IBM PCs, it was over. I\\'ll say it again, IBM\\'s distribution created demand for DOS, and then Microsoft just got to capture value from everyone else who wanted it.\\n\\nAll right, we would do bear and bull, listeners, but we know what happened after this. The bull case is that the party continues, and Microsoft continues shipping amazing operating systems after amazing operating systems. That stays the important thing in the world. The bear case is something else becomes an important thing in the world. Just having this super locked-in operating system is not actually the way to bet your whole company for the future.\\n\\nDavid: The dramatic tension for you all to come back for our next episode on Microsoft here is not because you want to find out what happens.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s true.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, take away, splinter. We\\'ve spent the last probably six weeks deep in this. We\\'ve talked to everybody. What are you thinking about in the middle of the night?\\n\\nBen: The IBM deal. I can\\'t unsee it. Microsoft figured out a way to take someone else\\'s dominance and wholesale transfer that into their dominance for the next generation. The fact that IBM called the Project Chess is so deeply ironic because Bill Gates was playing chess and they played checkers.\\n\\nDavid: Maybe Bill was playing 3D chess. This is the thing about it, though. We got to give IBM so much credit for Project Chess and the PC, that they even did what they did was huge, that a big entrenched corporation that could ship a skunkworks project in a year, revolutionized the industry. They just didn\\'t end up capturing any value out of it.\\n\\nBen: If I could make a less cheeky comment on it, I would say it\\'s that a new technology generation, when something becomes possible and opens up a new market, it enables a shift in the point of integration and a value chain.\\n\\nThe old value chain of IBM, if you shipped the mainframe, you had all the power. But in this new world of PCs, if you controlled the operating system that all the users were familiar with and all the developers wanted to target, you had all the power. I think that is not necessarily obvious unless you went through it and have the hindsight of history to be able to articulate it.\\n\\nDavid: I think you might be right. I think this might be the single best business deal negotiation of all time.\\n\\nBen: It arguably created $3 trillion of value.\\n\\nDavid: No, a lot more than that because this is the point about Microsoft being a platform. Microsoft is worth $3 trillion, but how much value has been created on top of Microsoft? No matter what you think, good, bad, or ugly of Microsoft, you can\\'t deny that.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely.\\n\\nDavid: At least twice as much, probably much, much more.\\n\\nBen: You watch every early interview with Bill, and you read a lot of his writing, he\\'s a great writer. It\\'s awesome that so many of his memos leaked whether intentionally or unintentionally over time.\\n\\nDavid: So many of his memos were issued for publication.\\n\\nBen: He really did view himself as a steward of the software ecosystem, and had this steadfast belief that software was magic and was going to change the world. Over the next 20 years, from 1975 to 1995, software did change the world, and Microsoft enabled it to happen.\\n\\nAgain, good, bad, or ugly, whatever you think of the company, they were sincere. I think the ugly part is, a lot of people want to hate on the value capture, because god did they capture value, but they were sincere in their desire and ability to create too.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. That\\'s super related to my takeaway here. The moment for me in the research and then when we\\'re telling the story along the way is when they start to believe in themselves that they don\\'t need IBM. Just the audacity, and I mean that in a pure good way of these kids. These kids changed the world. That\\'s so trite to say.\\n\\nMy book we read my daughter at bedtime and somebody gave us, it\\'s like the most Silicon Valley trophy thing ever. It\\'s like, what do you do with an idea? The punchline at the end of it is you change the world. It\\'s become such a trope, but these kids in the 70s did it. They believed in themselves in the beginning and then more and more and more over time.\\n\\nThere\\'s just this moment that I think, where they started to really, truly believe that they were going to change the world. Again, good, bad and ugly come out of that. Mostly good, I think, but just the level of ambition and audacity of these people is staggering.\\n\\nBen: Is that your splinter in your mind?\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s my splinter, yeah.\\n\\nBen: Listeners who are new to the show, we\\'ve been iterating on how we end episodes. We decided on this recently of, how should we land the plane? It\\'s to talk about the thing that we can\\'t stop thinking about.\\n\\nDavid: This company\\'s 49 years old, and it\\'s still the most valuable company in the world.\\n\\nBen: Crazy. All right, David, I have some trivia for you.\\n\\nDavid: I love it. Trivia before carve outs.\\n\\nBen: Do you know where Dave Marquardt from TVI first encountered Bill Gates?\\n\\nDavid: No, I just assumed it was through Steve.\\n\\nBen: Dave had watched Bill present many years earlier at none other than the Homebrew Computer Club at Stanford, the very place that is part of the Apple lore with Jobs and Woz showing off the early Apple computer. Apparently, Bill also went and made a presentation there and would hang out there, and that is where Dave first came across him.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing. When we were talking about the letter that Bill writes to the hobbyist community decrying piracy and software, he\\'s basically writing it to the Homebrew Computer Club. He believed that those were the people who were ripping off his software.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s amazing. All right, carveouts?\\n\\nDavid: All right, carveouts. For new listeners, at the end of every episode, Ben and I just chat about one or two things that we\\'ve been enjoying personally lately that usually have nothing to do with the episode.\\n\\nIn my case, I have two. The first one has a lot to do with the episode. I have discovered/rediscovered the LGR YouTube channel. Are you into this Ben?\\n\\nBen: No.\\n\\nDavid: Clint and LGR, and it stands for Lazy Game Reviews, which I think is how it started, but then it became so much more, and now it\\'s just LGR. Clint is this awesome dude, and I think he lives in North Carolina. He is dedicated to basking in the glory, restoring, reliving, and preserving computer history, hardware and software from this era. The YouTube channel is all unboxing a Compaq PC from 1992 or restoring a Windows 3.1 machine.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s awesome.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s so good. He\\'s got the best, most soothing voice in the world. He just seems like such a nice dude. He\\'s dedicated to preserving the era of computing that we are talking about on this episode. It\\'s so fun.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s cool. It\\'s really hard because all hardware fails eventually. At some point, there will be zero computers out there that can run Windows 3.1 that will boot. The only way to experience any of these things is through an emulator. I don\\'t know. To be able to capture high-res footage and stuff of those machines while they still work, it\\'s cool.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, super cool. My other carve out is Andre 3000 from Outkast. Do you know what Andre 3000 is up to these days?\\n\\nBen: Not at all. No.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, my God. Okay. GQ just did a big interview with Andre 3000 because he just released a new album. This is not what you think. Andre, a lot of people say, consensus top five rappers of all time. Big Boi, his counterpart in Outkast, also great too, but they basically went out on top.\\n\\nThey did Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which was their double album. I think it came out 2004 maybe. I was a freshman in college.\\n\\nBen: Hey Ya was on that, right?\\n\\nDavid: Hey Ya, yeah, everything was on that. They did one more album, and then they stopped. Andre would be featured on some other rappers tracks over the years, but didn\\'t put out another album for close to 20 years. He just put out an album, and he just did this big video interview with GQ.\\n\\nThe album is a flute album. He got really into woodwind instruments. This has been his life. He reveals in the interview that he has put out other songs and other albums over the years under pseudonyms. This interview is so great. It\\'s so unexpected because the interviewer keeps asking, you\\'re Andre 3000, why\\'d you stop rapping? I don\\'t have anything to say. Am I going to rap about getting a colonoscopy? This is where my life is right now. I never wanted to put out any work that wasn\\'t both authentic and great. I didn\\'t have anything to say anymore.\\n\\nBen: Yup, I love that. If you ever heard the phrase, go out when the top row at the back of the auditorium is empty?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and that\\'s what they did. Idlewild which was the album that came out after Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, was great, but it wasn\\'t that, and yet that\\'s exactly what he did.\\n\\nBen: I think it\\'s a Seinfeld quote. I might misattribute it. Drop a note in the Slack if I did, but I think it\\'s a Seinfeld quote. \"You let one row be empty, but you don\\'t want to wait too long.\"\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, it\\'s the same thing as what Seinfeld did.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: Super fun. We\\'ll link to it in the show notes.\\n\\nBen: All right. I have three and they\\'re all different. We\\'ve had a tradition on the recent episodes of doing multiple carveouts, and all of them are different genres. My product that I\\'ve really been loving, my physical product is the Meta Ray-Bans.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. I was talking with the team at Meta about them. They\\'re doing great.\\n\\nBen: I bet. It\\'s a pretty delightful product. I bought them because I was in Hawaii and with my four month old son. We were in the pool and stuff. My iPhone\\'s waterproof, but I want a different angle, and I don\\'t necessarily want to be holding my phone. It\\'s very cool to be able to take pictures and record video of what I actually see to be able to relive that moment.\\n\\nI did a bunch of photos and video. We were on vacation that way, and then I discovered a thing that they\\'re actually just awesome for. I think even better than AirPods is phone calls. The speakers are great. I wouldn\\'t say necessarily they\\'re the best for listening to music. The bass is obviously not as good as headphone bass. They project the sound down toward your ears. Unless you\\'re standing really close to me, you can\\'t really hear, or unless I have the volume all the way up.\\n\\nThe microphones are great too. I was on a long walk on the beach with the wind whipping by on a call with my mom. I was like, does this sound really bad and distorted to you? She\\'s like, not at all. I was really impressed and we\\'ll definitely be using them for more calls. I think that style of headphone over the ear, there are many things that it\\'s not good for.\\n\\nWhen you\\'re on an airplane or something, you want to plug your ears, or if you\\'re in a super loud environment. But unless you\\'re in one of those environments, it\\'s a nice break for your ears versus having AirPods jammed in. It\\'s a great call experience. So they\\'re great.\\n\\nThe battery\\'s great. It\\'s a four-hour battery, so it\\'s a low key, more subtle, augmented reality experience. There\\'s no heads up display. You don\\'t see anything, but when you get a text message, it\\'ll read it to you.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s more than just the camera system.\\n\\nBen: Totally. It basically is you have AirPods in, but you don\\'t actually have AirPods in, and you have a pretty good photo video camera on your face.\\n\\nDavid: Does it have an indication when you\\'re taking photo or recording video?\\n\\nBen: Yes. It\\'s not super bright. I\\'m not sure everybody really knows when you are, but if you know what to look for, you know if it\\'s on or off.\\n\\nDavid: Cool.\\n\\nBen: I\\'ve been loving it. I think it\\'s a great product. I intend to wear them a lot this summer.\\n\\nMy second one is a thank you to a very, very good designer, Julia Rundberg, who worked with David and I on a recent project for some design work, some of which is actually featured as we speak on Apple podcasts. She did a bunch of other stuff with us, too, and she\\'s really excellent.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for someone who\\'s good at visual identity, branding, slide decks, websites, I\\'ve worked with her on a few projects before and she\\'s just awesome, so I wanted to recommend her.\\n\\nMy third is this community spotlight to go all the way back to nine years ago Acquired. It was a listener who runs a company called Summer Health reached out and said, I heard you say that you have a baby. I\\'ve got this great company that is for new parents, and here\\'s some info on it. I am now a paying member. It is an on-demand texting relationship with a pediatrician.\\n\\nDavid: Wow. This is crack for new parents.\\n\\nBen: It is crack for parents. It\\'s crazy. You can hook up multiple phones, so my wife and I both have a direct line to like, something weird is going on, will you help me through it? We had a 2:00 AM wake up the other night. Everything ended up being fine, but as I\\'m sure any other new parents can relate to, you really want to make sure in the middle of the night, if you\\'re not sure if everything\\'s fine, you would like to figure out the right steps to make sure everything\\'s fine. Having a virtual doctor on demand is totally amazing. Summer Health, if you are a new parent, we\\'ve been loving it.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing. I\\'m going to have to subscribe. We\\'ve referred to this before. I think this will probably be the last episode that comes out while I\\'m still the parent of just one child. Number two coming soon. If it may take a little longer than usual for the next Microsoft episode to come out, our next six-hour opus on Microsoft, don\\'t get too mad, that is the reason why.\\n\\nBen: We have a lot of thank yous on this one, as you can imagine. People were really generous with their time, pointing us to different resources, explaining their recollection of history as it happened. Being in Seattle, active in the venture community here, both through PSL and David, you\\'re in my shared history at Madrona, me working at Microsoft, a lot of good opportunities to learn what really happened from folks.\\n\\nA huge thank you to Mike Slade who spent the time with me. Mike spent two different stints at Microsoft and then at NeXT, and Apple in between.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, he worked for Steve at NeXT, right?\\n\\nBen: Yup. One of the few people in the world who both spent a ton of time with Steve, Bill, and worked closely with both of them. It\\'s so great to get his perspective, especially about the early days of Office and the applications group. Very helpful. Similarly, Pete Higgins worked closely with Mike. Pete, I think, ran Excel for a long time and oversaw a lot of the different stuff in the applications group, and I believe also ran Office.\\n\\nIt\\'s funny how many different people picked up the mantle over time as these things traded around groups. But frankly, I think that\\'s a huge part of the Microsoft story. The company very quickly adapted and changed its structure depending on the current needs of technology, competitors, and et cetera.\\n\\nHuge thanks to Tren Griffin, who is actually a lifelong Seattleite and close friend to the whole Gates family. Bill Gates Sr. was his mentor. I\\'m sure you\\'ve seen Tren\\'s prolific tweets online about Microsoft history. Actually, Tren I think currently works at Microsoft in a strategy role. Thanks Tren for your help as well. David, I know you\\'ve got a bunch.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Also, speaking of former Microsoft folks who are very active and prolific on Twitter, we talked to Steven Sinofsky who had lots and lots of great perspective, and we can\\'t wait to share more of it on the next episode.\\n\\nBen: I read 20 of Steven\\'s Hardcore Software posts. When David and I were dividing up what belongs in what episode, I realized 19 of them belong in next episode. Steven, thank you for your early prep work for part two.\\n\\nDavid: So much fun internet stuff to talk with that Steven was right there for. I spoke with other people who ran windows, Terry Myerson who\\'s a great friend and a supporter of the show. Terry ran Windows for quite a long time, right?\\n\\nBen: Yeah. When I was there, Terry was EVP over Windows and Windows Phone.\\n\\nDavid: Terry was very generous. He was actually the first person that clued us into just how key Steve\\'s role was in building the enterprise for Microsoft.\\n\\nBen: And how different the go to market motions were for Windows and Office. I think Terry was the one that gave us the insight of Windows, especially in the early days. It was basically an OEM game, small group doing an OEM thing.\\n\\nDavid: There were 10 people selling that.\\n\\nBen: And it\\'s still I don\\'t think a very big team even today.\\n\\nDavid: Speaking of strategy, Charles Fitzgerald, who\\'s OG in Microsoft and a great platform strategy guy, prolific angel investor in Seattle now, it\\'s fun chatting with him about the early days.\\n\\nBen: Obviously, Brad Silverberg who we mentioned a bunch. It was very fun seeing after spending some time talking with Brad and texting a lot with him to see the end of the Windows 95 announcement after Bill and Jay Leno are done for Brad to come out and finish it off. It\\'s fun. It\\'s like watching a time machine, watching that thing is really cool.\\n\\nSoma Somasegar at Madrona is someone that David and I love crossing paths with in the Seattle entrepreneurship ecosystem.\\n\\nDavid: Soma\\'s just such a legend at Microsoft and in the industry too. There\\'s so many people who Soma made their careers, plucked them out of school, saw something in them that maybe they didn\\'t even see in themselves, and then they went on to be big executives or venture capitalists at Microsoft or elsewhere.\\n\\nBen: Lastly, huge thank you to Steve Ballmer. To be honest, it was a little bit surreal chatting and hearing about his experience over the whole thing. There\\'s nobody including Bill Gates that bleeds Microsoft more than Steve Ballmer, and his just unabashed pure pride in what they built is infectious.\\n\\nDavid: Absolutely. It was so fun talking to Steve. He was so gracious with his time. It must have been just super special for you too. He was the CEO when you worked there.\\n\\nBen: Totally. To be frank, I had a very opposite strategy in mind, but I was a new hire out of college, individual contributor PM. It was still the Windows company then, and Steve was championing the Windows strategy, and I was a guy working on Office for iPad.\\n\\nWith that, our huge thank you to JP Morgan Payments, ServiceNow, and Pilot. You can click the link in the show notes to learn more about any of those great partners of Acquired.\\n\\nIf you like this episode, I was thinking of ones to recommend. It would be pretty funny to go listen to the forethought acquisition, given all of this context. It\\'s a short episode when David and I were not good at this yet, and we did our very best. It is from our early days, and it covers overlapping source material.\\n\\nDavid: Forethought was the company that made PowerPoint, Microsoft acquired, the first major acquisition for the company.\\n\\nBen: If you are new to the show and looking for great recent episodes that we\\'ve done, I highly recommend the Visa one as discussed earlier in the Network of Networks idea, if you haven\\'t heard that, or perhaps the Nintendo or NVIDIA episodes, all of which will be right up your alley if you liked this one.\\n\\nDavid: If you\\'re not at all interested in technology or software, but have somehow managed to get through all these hours with us, give a listen to our LVMH and Hermes episodes. Even if you do love technology and software, which obviously you do if you\\'re still here, there\\'s so much to learn from that world.\\n\\nBen: If you want to know every time an episode drops, get hints at the next episode topic, and get episode corrections and follow up, you can sign up at acquired.fm/email. Come discuss this episode with everyone else who\\'s chatting about it at acquired.fm/slack.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for another episode, go check out our second show, ACQ2, where we will have actually some very awesome tech CEO guests coming out over the next month or so that are absolutely worth listening to, especially if you\\'re interested in semiconductor and tech history. If you want some sweet Acquired merch, go to acquire.fm/store.\\n\\nWith that, listeners, we\\'ll see you next time.\\n\\nDavid: We\\'ll see you next time.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  'followups_and_corrections': \"Follow-Ups and Corrections:\\n\\n• The first GUI actually pre-dates Xerox PARC! Doug Englebart's “Mother of All Demos” was at Stanford Research Institute in 1968, demoing the first mouse, graphical user interface, and more. Many of these team members did however go onto form the core group of researchers at Xerox PARC.\\n\\n• We said that Steve Ballmer became the development manager for Windows 1.0 after the former dev manager was fired. That is not the case — that person resigned unexpectedly.\\n\\n• We left out the story of the development of “Protect Mode” Windows, which was a secret skunkworks project driven by a brilliant engineer named David Weise and his boss, Phil Barrett. (And not authorized by management!) By accessing the Intel 386 processor’s “protect mode”, David was able to allow Windows apps to use the chip’s full 16MB of memory, instead of just the standard 1MB memory they otherwise would have had. This was absolutely essential to making Windows commercially and technically viable in the marketplace (and eventually led to it dominating OS/2, Mac, etc). (Thanks to Rob Glaser)\\n\\n• Windows 386 was a key bridge product that paved the way for Windows 3.0 and 3.1. Win386 leveraged one key feature of the 386 chip that wasn’t in the 286 – the ability to multitask multiple 8086 virtual machines, which allowed multiple DOS apps to stay active at the same time. This was a super valuable feature for several transitional years. (Thanks to Rob Glaser)\\n\\n• The competing OS from UCSD was actually called “UCSD p-System”, not Pascal. Pascal was and is a programming language that UCSD contributed heavily to. (Thanks to Brad Feld)\\n\\n• The DEC operating system originally written by Dave Cutler (and other DEC colleagues) was actually named VMS, not VAX. The whole machine/system was commonly called VAX. (Thanks also to Brad Feld)\\n\\n• The decision to have Excel be made for the Mac instead of the PC was a huge and very disruptive decision made by Bill personally. Excel (code named Odyssey at the time) was originally being developed for the PC. When Bill changed it, the team didn’t like it, and the head of the Odyssey team (Doug Klunder) decided to quit over that decision (but was persuaded to stay until Excel 1.0 shipped).

       "  'about': 'Renaissance Technologies is the best performing investment firm of all time. And yet no one at RenTec would consider themselves an “investor”, at least in any traditional sense of the word. It’d rather be more accurate to call them scientists — scientists who’ve discovered a system of math, computers and artificial intelligence that has evolved into the greatest money making machine the world has ever seen. And boy does it work: RenTec’s alchemic colossus has posted annual returns in the firm’s flagship Medallion Fund of 68% gross and 40% net over the past 34 years,while never once losing money. (For those keeping track at home, $1,000 invested in Medallion in 1988 would have compounded to $46.5B today… if you’d been allowed to keep it in.) Tune in for an incredible story of the small group of rebel mathematicians who didn’t just beat the market, but in the words of author Greg Zuckerman “solved it.”\\u200d Sponsors:',\n",
       "  'transcript': 'Ben: I always used to misspell Renaissance as I was typing it out at R-E-N, and then I would not really know what came from there, but I learned a mnemonic to make sure I get it right.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, I thought you were going to say you’ve typed it so many times now over the past month.\\n\\nBen: Well, there’s that too. But you ready for this? You can’t spell Renaissance without AI.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, touche, touche.\\n\\nBen: All right, let’s do it.\\n\\nWelcome to season 14, episode 3 of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. I’m Ben Gilbert.\\n\\nDavid: I’m David Rosenthal.\\n\\nBen: And we are your hosts. They say, David, that as an investor, you can’t beat the market or time the market, that you’re better off indexing and dollar cost averaging rather than trying to be an active stock picker. They say there’s no persistence of returns for hedge funds, that this year’s big winner can be next year’s big loser, and that nobody gets huge outperformance without taking huge risk.\\n\\nDavid: When I was in college, I actually took an economics class with Burton Malkiel, who of course was involved in starting Vanguard and who’s a big proponent of all that. And that is what I learned, Ben.\\n\\nBen: Well, David, it turns out they were wrong. Today, listeners, we tell the story of the best performing investment firm in history—Renaissance Technologies or RenTech. Their 30-year track record managing billions of dollars has better returns than anyone you have ever heard of, including Berkshire Hathaway, Bridgewater, George Soros, Peter Lynch, or anyone else.\\n\\nSo why haven’t you heard of them? Or if you have, why don’t you know much about them? Well, their eye-popping performance is matched only by their extreme secrecy, and they are unusual in almost every way. Their founder, Jim Simons, worked for the US government in the Cold War as a codebreaker before starting Renaissance.\\n\\nNone of the founders or early employees had any investing background, and they built the entire thing by hiring PhD physicists, astronomers, and speech recognition researchers. They’re located in the middle of nowhere in a tiny town on Long Island. They don’t pay attention to revenues, profits, or even who the CEOs are of the companies that they invest in. And at any given time, they probably couldn’t even tell you what actual stocks they own.\\n\\nNow you may be thinking, okay, great, I just learned about this insane fund with unbelievable performance—to be specific listeners, that’s 66% annual returns before fees—and I want to invest. Well, you can’t. To add to everything else that I just said, RenTech’s flagship Medallion fund doesn’t take any outside investors. The partners of the firm have become so wealthy from the billions that the fund has generated that the only investors they allow in are themselves.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, we are going to talk a lot about that towards the end of the episode, because I think it’s the key to the whole thing.\\n\\nBen: Ooh, Cliffhanger. David. I’m excited. So what exactly does Renaissance do? Why does it work? And how did it evolve to be the way it is today? While the resources out there are scarce because for one, employees sign a lifetime non-disclosure agreement, David and I are going to take you through everything we’ve learned about the firm from our research dating all the way back before Jim Simons started as a math professor to understand it all.\\n\\nThis episode was selected by our Acquired limited partners. To be honest, I didn’t think enough people knew what RenTech was to pick it, but when we put it out for a vote, the people have spoken.

Our most recent episode was with Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, who led the team that created the first GLP-1s at Novo Nordisk, so awesome follow-up to the Novo episode if you liked that one.\\n\\nBefore we dive in, we want to briefly share our presenting sponsor this season, is J.P. Morgan, specifically their incredible payments business.\\n\\nDavid: Just like how we say every company has a story, every company’s story is powered by payments, and J.P. Morgan Payments is a part of so many companies that we talk about on Acquired. It’s not just the Fortune 500 too. They’re also helping companies grow from seed to IPO and beyond.\\n\\nBen: Yup. With that, the show is not investment advice, David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss, or perhaps wish we did, and this show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. David, where do we start our story today?\\n\\nDavid: We start in 1938 in Newton, Massachusetts, which is a fairly wealthy suburb just outside of Boston, where one James Simons is born. Both of Jim’s parents were very, very smart, especially his mother, Marsha. His dad was a salesman for 20th Century Fox, the movie company. His job was he went around to theaters in the northeast and sold packages of movies to them.\\n\\nBen: Super cool.\\n\\nDavid: By the way, we know all this because we have to thank Greg Zuckerman, author of The Man Who Solved the Market, which is the only book out there that is solely dedicated to RenTech and Jim Simons. We actually got to talk to Greg in our research. He helped us out a bunch. Thank you, Greg.\\n\\nBen: And helped fact check a few of our assumptions of what happened after the book came out.\\n\\nDavid: So that was Jim’s parents, but really a major influence on him growing up was his grandfather, Marsha’s dad. There are already echoes of the Bezos story here with the grandfather, the mother’s father, spending a bunch of time with him, and rubbing off on young Jeff, or young Jim in this case. Bezos, of course, would get his start in his career at D. E. Shaw.\\n\\nBen: A quant fund coming up at the same time as RenTech.\\n\\nDavid: But back to Jim here in the 1940s, his grandfather Peter, owned a shoe factory that made women’s dress shoes. Jim spends a ton of time there growing up at the factory.\\n\\nJim’s grandfather, Peter, was quite the character. He was a Russian immigrant and he’s still more Russia than Boston at this point in time. As Greg puts it in the book, Peter reveled in telling Jim and his cousins stories of the motherland involving wolves, women, caviar, and vodka. He teaches young Jim when he’s a child here in the factory to say Russian phrases like, give me a cigarette and kiss my ass.\\n\\nBen: Which I think he probably would say that thousands of times the rest of his life.\\n\\nDavid: I think so. If you watch interviews with Jim, his hands are always twitching because he has chain-smoked his entire life, probably going back to age 10 in the factory.\\n\\nBen: Three packs of Merits a day.\\n\\nDavid: Unbelievable.\\n\\nBen: Although I think he quit later in life, but he definitely chain-smoked the better part of the first (call it) 75 years or something.\\n\\nDavid: There are these famous stories of the conference rooms at RenTech and the war rooms when the market is going through a crazy gyration, and it’s just filled with cigarette smoke and it’s all Jim.\\n\\nBen: Different time.\\n\\nDavid: Different time. So back to Jim’s childhood, though, here in the Boston suburbs. He grows up certainly not uber wealthy or uber rich, but very, very solidly upper middle class. And especially he’s an only child, he has all the resources of his parents, his family, his grandfathers, this well-to-do entrepreneur.\\n\\nJim gets to rub shoulders in the Boston area with people who are really rich. He says later, “I observed that it’s very nice to be rich. I had no interest in business, which is not to say I had no interest in money.”\\n\\nBen: Yes. Important to tease out the difference between those two things.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Very, very important. What he means when he says he has no interest in business, it’s because from a pretty young age, he gets really into math. Legend has it when Jim is four years old, he stumbles into one of Zeno’s famous paradoxes from ancient Greek times.\\n\\nBen: Yup. This is great. The basic gist of Zeno’s paradoxes, if you are always taking a quantity and dividing it by two, you will never hit zero. You’ll asymptotically approach zero, but you will never actually touch zero. You need to do addition or subtraction to do that. Division won’t cut it.\\n\\nJim, as a 4-year-old, when he observes they need to go to the gas station to fill up the tank, he throws out the idea, well, let’s just use only half the gas in the tank because then we’ll still be able to, after that, only use half the gas in the tank. The funny thing that doesn’t occur to a 4-year-old is, well then, we’re just not going to get very far.\\n\\nDavid: Jim’s dream is to go to MIT down the street in Cambridge and study math. He graduates high school in three years, and during the second semester of Jim’s freshman year there, he enrolls in a graduate math seminar on abstract algebra. Pretty heavy stuff.\\n\\nBen: Jim would go on to finish his undergrad at MIT in three years, and get a master’s in one year.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Pretty, pretty smart. But it turns out that that freshman year grad seminar he took actually has a big impact on him because he doesn’t do well in the class. He can’t keep up. Jim’s pretty self-aware here.\\n\\nThere are other people at MIT who never run into problems. They never hit a limit, they never struggle understanding any concept. He realizes that, oh, I’m smart, I’m very, very smart. I’m smarter than most other people here. But I’m not one of those people.\\n\\nBen: Which is what do you do with that information? You realize you have to add a few of your skills together to become the best at something. You have to be smart and something else.\\n\\nDavid: Jim’s own words on this are, I was a good mathematician. I wasn’t the greatest in the world, but I was pretty good. But he recognizes, like you said, Ben, that he has a different advantage that most of the super geniuses lacked. And that’s, as he put it, he had good taste.\\n\\nThese are his words. “Taste in science is very important. To distinguish what’s a good problem and what’s a problem that no one’s going to care about the answer to anyway, that’s taste. And I think I have good taste.”\\n\\nBen: By the way, this is exactly the same thing as Jeff Bezos in college, realizing he wanted to be a theoretical physicist. He met some of the extreme brainpower people that would go on to become the best theoretical physicists in the world. He said, I’m smart, but I’m not that smart, so switched to computer science.\\n\\nDavid: I think the analogy here is like sports. There are all-star players, there are Hall of Famers, and then there are LeBron and MJ. Jim ends up being a Hall of Famer mathematician, but he’s not Tom Brady.\\n\\nBen: He is got a pretty important theorem named after him.\\n\\nDavid: That goes on to become a foundation of string theory in physics, which isn’t even Jim’s field.\\n\\nBen: Crazy.\\n\\nDavid: So this realization that Jim has about himself, though, both that he’s not the smartest person in the room at a place like MIT, but he can hang with them, and that he has this taste concept, (I think) becomes one of the most important keys to the secret sauce that ends up getting built at RenTech.\\n\\nHe can relate to everybody. He understands what’s going on. Any person off the street probably couldn’t even really have a conversation with these folks, but he can. And yet he also has the perspective, maybe some of this is from his grandfather of what is important out there in the real world. And as a result, all of his friends at MIT and these super smart people look up to him because you aren’t like the kid in the corner at the high school dance. You’re cool.\\n\\nBen: He’s the extroverted theoretical mathematician.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. He was elected class president in high school. He smoked cigarettes. He’s popular with the ladies. He looks like Humphrey Bogart. He’s a popular dude, especially at this point in time—we’re now in the late 50s when Jim’s at MIT—this is kind of the James Dean and Rebel Without A Cause era.\\n\\nAfter graduation, Jim leads his buddies on a road trip with motor scooters—you can’t make this stuff up—from Boston down to Bogota, where one of his classmates is from. The idea is that they’re going to do something so epic that the newspapers are going to have to write about it. They all load up on scooters and drive down to Bogota. They get into all sorts of adventures. There are knives, guns, and they get thrown in jail.\\n\\nBen: It’s honestly crazy that this group of people took this type of risk.\\n\\nDavid: Totally crazy. After he is done an MIT and after the road trip, Jim heads out to Berkeley in California so that he could do his PhD with the Professor Shiing-Shen Chern. Much later in life, Jim would collaborate with Chern for the Chern-Simons theory that we talked about earlier that becomes one of the foundational parts of string theory in physics.\\n\\nBefore Jim leaves for the West coast, he meets a girl in Boston, and they decide to get engaged in four days. This is him back then, these were the times. When they get to California and they get married, Jim takes the $5000 wedding gift that I believe they got from her parents and he decides, I want to multiply this. So he starts driving from Berkeley into San Francisco every morning to go hang out at the Merrill Lynch brokerage office, just be a rat hanging around the brokerage and find ways to trade and turn this money into something more.\\n\\nBen: Which is so interesting to think about because at that point in time, there was such an advantage to just being there. This wasn’t even the trading floor, but information is all so manual and also relationship-driven in the markets, that there was basically no way to be in on the action unless you were physically there in on the action.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. You couldn’t just log into Yahoo Finance or something, or open the stocks app on your iPhone, which even the information they were getting was God knows how long delayed from New York or from Chicago for the futures and commodities that are being traded that Jim gets into. He’s as close to the action as he can possibly be, but he’s a long, long way from the action. Nonetheless, when he starts out doing this, Jim hits a hot streak and he goes up 50% in a few days.\\n\\nBen: Trading is easy.\\n\\nDavid: Trading is easy. He says, I was hooked. It was a rush.\\n\\nBen: I bet.\\n\\nDavid: Except he ends up losing all of his profits just as quickly.\\n\\nBen: Important to learn that lesson early.\\n\\nDavid: Also right around this time, Barbara (his wife) gets pregnant with their first child and is like, you can’t be driving into San Francisco every morning and gambling our future like this.\\n\\nBen: Effectively playing the ponies.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Jim’s like, okay, okay, I’ll stop. I’ll focus on academia for now. He finishes his PhD in two years. They come back to Boston and he joins MIT as a junior professor at age 23. They stay one year in Boston. But Jim, even though he’s got a family, even though he is super successful as a young academic here because he’s got kids, he’s restless.\\n\\nOne of his buddies from the scooter trip to Bogota is from Bogota and lives there, his family’s there, has an idea to start a flooring tile manufacturing company. He’s like, the flooring at MIT and in Boston is so much nicer than in Bogota. We should start a company and make the same kind of flooring here.\\n\\nBen: When I read this, I couldn’t believe that this was Jim Simons’ first business venture. It’s so random, but it really is emblematic of just how much he was thrill-seeking and just looking for anything that was unexpected, different, exciting. He just gets bored fast.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Not just is this the start of his entrepreneurial career, the seeds of this financially is what goes on to start RenTech.\\n\\nBen: It’s wild.\\n\\nDavid: Totally wild. Jim takes a year off and goes down to Bogota.\\n\\nBen: This is a guy with an MIT undergrad and masters and a Berkeley PhD in theoretical math.\\n\\nDavid: Who’s now a professor at MIT.\\n\\nBen: Who is taking a year off to go work on a flooring company in Bogota.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, accurate. He does that for a year, they get it set up, he gets bored again. He is like, all right, I don’t want to just run this company. I’ve helped set it up. I have an ownership stake in it. Now, he bounces back to Boston, this time to Harvard as a professor there for a year.\\n\\nBen: He’s really racking them up.\\n\\nDavid: But he spends a year there and he’s like, ah, got the itch again. The junior professor’s salary isn’t that much. We said about him back from his childhood days, he sees the appeal in being rich. He’s like, this is not a path to being rich. He’s like, I’m going to go put my skills out on the open market.\\n\\nHe gets a job in Princeton, New Jersey, not at Princeton University, but at the Institute for Defense Analyses, which is a nonprofit organization that consults exclusively for the US government, specifically the Defense Department, and specifically the NSA. These are the civilian code breakers.\\n\\nBen: Yes. It was basically formed with this idea that: (1) across various branches of our government, we need better collaboration and cross funding of the same initiatives, and (2) there are going to be a lot of people who don’t work for the government that we’re going to want to hire to do some pretty secret work.\\n\\nDavid: The IDA there in Princeton functioned like the Institute for Advanced Study, which is also in Princeton. That’s where Einstein went when he came to America. An independent think tank research group, except it’s solely focused on code breaking and signal intelligence with the Russians during the Cold War.\\n\\nBen: It’s a pretty wild charter, and especially how special of an organization it was. The way these people would spend their time is part code breaking but part goofing around, because the creativity of mathematicians working together on passion projects is important to discovering clever new algorithms.\\n\\nDavid: This is so, so key, and this culture ends up getting translated whole cloth right into RenTech. The way IDA worked—I assume still works to this day—is they recruited top mathematicians and academics to come be codebreakers there. They would double their salaries…\\n\\nBen: And importantly, it couldn’t have been a government division if they were going to be doing that because there’s very specific congressionally-approved budgets for payroll.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. They figured out that they needed to attract the smartest people in the world who weren’t going to come just go work for the Department of Defense. This was the way to do it.\\n\\nLike you said, Ben, the charter of the group was that employees had to spend 50% of their time doing code breaking, but the other 50% of the time they were free to do whatever they wanted, like research, pursue whatever they were doing in academia, publish papers.\\n\\nThe appeal of going there was, hey, it’s the same thing as being a professor at MIT or Princeton or Harvard or whatever, except you’re doing code breaking instead of teaching, and there’s no bureaucracy to worry about, there’s no politics. It’s just, hey, you do your code breaking work, and then you publish. You can collaborate with your colleagues there.\\n\\nNow, this is pretty crazy. Very quickly after Jim arrives at IDA—remember he’s in money-making mode at this point in time—he recruits a bunch of his very brilliant colleagues to come work with him in their 50% free time on an idea to apply the same work and technologies that they’re using in code breaking and signal intelligence to trading in the stock market.\\n\\nThey come together and they publish a paper called Probabilistic Models for and Prediction of Stock Market Behavior. Everything that they suggest in this paper really is RenTech, just 20 years before RenTech.\\n\\nBen: It’s crazy. 1964 this was published?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Now at this point in time, fundamental analysis was then, as in most of the world today still is the primary way of investing in things of, hey, I know this company, I’m going to analyze their revenues, their price multiple, or I’m going to think about what’s happening in the currency markets or in the commodity markets and why copper is moving here, or the British pound is moving there and I’m going to invest on those insights.\\n\\nBen: You’re effectively looking at the intrinsic value of an asset, trying to assign it a value, and make investments based on that.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, fundamental investing. There also existed in the 60s technical investing, which is kind of voodoo. This is like I’m looking at a stock chart and I’ve got a feeling that it’s going to go up, like I’m tracing this pattern and it’s going up baby. Or no, no, no. This pattern is going down.\\n\\nBen: Using the phrase ‘technical’ might be a little generous. But what they’re looking for, basically trying to mine trading behavior for signal about the way that it will trade in the future rather than mining the intrinsic information about an asset for what you think it will do in the future.\\n\\nDavid: What Jim and his colleagues here are suggesting is that, but just not really done by humans. It’s that with a lot more data and a lot more sophisticated signal processing.\\n\\nBen: And importantly you might say, why is it this group of people that came to that conclusion of applying computational signal analysis to investing? Well, it’s effectively the same thing as code breaking. You are looking for signal in the noise, and trying to use computers and algorithms to mine signal from something that otherwise looks random.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. When Jim started working on code breaking, I think he just looked right back to his experience trading in the markets and was like, whoa, this is the same thing.\\n\\nBen: Which is not an insight other people had. That was the amazing thing about his background priming him to realize that.\\n\\nDavid: There’s all this noise in this data, and it is impossible for a human to sit here, look at this data, and say, oh, I know what the Soviets are saying. No, no, you have to use mathematical models and statistical analysis to extract the patterns.\\n\\nBen: So mathematical models, statistical analysis, we actually hear a lot of that in the world today because machine learning is a thing.\\n\\nDavid: What they are really doing here at IDA, and then soon in RenTech, is early machine learning. Jim just had this incredibly brilliant insight that you can use these techniques and this technology for making investments, which makes this the perfect time to talk about our presenting sponsor for this season, J.P. Morgan payments.\\n\\nBen: The finance industry has a rich history of innovating, dating all the way back to the literal renaissance, where double entry bookkeeping and letters of credit revolutionized global trade and economic development. J.P. Morgan payments really continues that tradition in their technology investments today.\\n\\nThey move $10 trillion a day securely. That is a quarter of all US dollar flows globally. Just think about the sheer volume of data at 5000 transactions per second and how important that is to the global economy.\\n\\nDavid: Unsurprisingly, J.P. Morgan payments has been in the AI game for years now. Similar to RenTech, they were also early to recognize the value of AI to gather process, and analyze those massive troves of data to provide solutions for their customers and mitigate risk, like when they incorporated AI into their cashflow forecasting tool, which helps businesses manage liquidity, and that proved especially valuable during the pandemic.\\n\\nBen: Also unsurprisingly, J.P. Morgan was ranked number one in a recent global banking index of AI capabilities with Fortune, saying they were “head and shoulders” above the others. Their customers get AI-powered payment solutions for fraud prevention, customer and treasury insights, all of which grows the bottom line. They can even analyze transaction data to predict and mitigate fraud patterns in real time with their validation services, helping stop millions of dollars for customers in attempted fraud.\\n\\nDavid: We were doing some research to prep for this segment and we came across something pretty wild. The United States Treasury Department has started using AI to detect suspected check fraud, and recovered over $375 million in 2023 utilizing the new tools. The US Treasury Department disperses trillions of dollars annually. If they continue to employ new technologies like this, it could really add up to the tune of billions.\\n\\nHow does this fit in? Well, the Treasury Department recently selected J.P. Morgan to provide account validation services for federal agencies. Obviously, payment integrity and this issue of improper payments is top of mind for them and at enormous scale. So whether you are one of the largest institutions in the world or a small business like us here at Acquired, J.P. Morgan offers you peace of mind and protection.\\n\\nBen: One more playbook theme in common between RenTech and J.P. Morgan payments, they both analyze data to uncover patterns and insights you may never think to look for.\\n\\nOne of their clients, a furniture store, discovered a correlation with customers who also shop at pet stores where shoppers spent 76% more than the average customer when this was the case. So the furniture store launched a line of pet-friendly furnishings for that audience. These are the insights that drive growth with J.P. Morgan payments as your partner.\\n\\nDavid: When it comes to payments technology, businesses of all sizes can benefit from having end-to-end AI-powered solutions that are constantly learning. And J.P. Morgan’s API first infrastructure across all aspects of treasury and payments is a one-stop shop solution.\\n\\nBen: To learn more, check out jpmorgan.com/acquired. And fun fact listeners, it is fraud prevention month, so listeners can learn even more by following at J.P. Morgan on LinkedIn.\\n\\nOkay, David, this paper is published. They’re going to trade and make a whole bunch of money in the stock market by applying this code-breaking, signal processing, data analysis approach to investing.\\n\\nDavid: Then the natural question is, okay, what is the model here? How are they going to do this? It turns out that one of the employees of IDA at this time, and one of the members of this sort of rebel group (shall we say) within the organization, is a guy named Lenny Baum. Lenny just happens to be the world expert in a mathematical concept called a Markov model, specifically a version of the Markov model called a hidden Markov model.\\n\\nNow, a Markov model is a statistical concept that’s used to model pseudo-random or chaotic situations. Basically it says, let’s abandon any attempt to actually understand what is going on in all of this data that we have. Instead, just focus on what are the observable states that we can see of the situation.\\n\\nCan we identify different states that the situation is in? If we just do that, can we predict future states based on what we’ve observed about the patterns of past states? The answer to that is usually yes, even if you don’t know anything about fundamentally how the system operates.\\n\\nBen: The great example that Greg Zuckerman gives in the book is…\\n\\nDavid: A baseball game.\\n\\nBen: There are three balls and two strikes. That state has a narrow set of states after it. It’s going to be a strikeout, they’re going to get on base, it’s going to be a walk, or maybe they foul it off and it keeps going. There’s only really a narrow set of things that could happen after that.\\n\\nWhereas when it’s zero balls and zero strikes, there’s a lot that could happen. They could just keep pitching. And if you don’t know the rules, you’re like, why do they just keep pitching?\\n\\nIt’s this great way to explain this idea of the black box that if nobody tells you the rules to the game by observing the outputs enough and observing, okay, in this state these outputs are possible, you actually can get pretty good at (at least) if not predicting, understanding the probability distribution of the outcomes for any given state in the game.\\n\\nDavid: We brought up machine learning and AI a minute ago. This is a foundational concept to modern day AI. If you think about large language models and predicting what comes next, it’s not like these large language models necessarily understand English. They’re just really, really good at predicting states and the next state, i.e., characters and the next character, or pixels and the next set of pixels or frame, et cetera.\\n\\nBen: Obviously, they’re much fancier than that, but that is the underpinning of it all. I remember in my sophomore year of college computer science class, I had a Markov chain assignment. It was basically write a Java program to ingest this public domain book, then I would give it a seed word, the first word of each sentence, and press return, return, return, return, return. It would scan through the probability tree and give me the most probable word based on the corpus of the book that it just read to create some sentence.\\n\\nIt feels like magic. Of course, in these early rudimentary Markov chain things like the one I did in college, it spits out nonsense. But that would evolve to be the LLMs that we know of today.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. That is what they were using at IDA to do codebreaking, and that’s what they propose in this paper that they could use in the stock market too.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. The way that this applies to investing is just like you might not know the rules of baseball, but if you’ve watched enough baseball, you can guess at what the probabilities of the next thing to happen are based on the state.\\n\\nInvesting’s kind of the same thing, or at least the stock market movements are, where you don’t know the future. You don’t know what’s going to happen. You don’t know if stock X affects stock Y in some way because you don’t know in what way those companies do business together or who holds both stocks. Are they overlapping investors? You don’t know the relationship between those companies, so you can’t forecast with 100% certainty of what is going to happen.\\n\\nHowever, if you suck in enough data about what has happened in the past and the probability distribution from every given state in the past, you probably could make some educated guesses or at least understand the probability of any individual outcome based on a state today of what could happen next.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly. Jim and Lenny and this whole little crew are pretty fired up. They’re like, oh, great, Let’s go raise a fund and invest in the markets using this strategy.\\n\\nBen: Certainly we’re going to be successful at raising that fund and certainly we’re going to be very profitable because we’ve got this great idea.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. What could go wrong? Well, in the mid 60s, the idea that some wonky academics at some random secretive agency in Princeton, New Jersey could go raise money, was non-viable.\\n\\nIt was hard enough for Warren Buffet to raise money at this point in time for his fund, and he was Benjamin Graham’s anointed, appointed disciple. And here are these academics who are working at some random, unknown non-profit, saying give us money. We don’t know anything about these companies that we’re going to invest in. We don’t know anything about fundamentals, but we’ve got a really good algorithm. People are probably like, what is an algorithm? So they just have no access to capital.\\n\\nBen: This was decades before it became high pedigree to come from a technical or computer science background in the world of investing.\\n\\nDavid: A bunch of Keystone Cops–style fundraising happens here. They’re going around in secret, trying to keep the IDA bosses from knowing what they’re doing. One of the group ends up leaving a copy of the investment prospectus on the copy machine at work one night. The boss discovers it, calls them all into his office, and is like, guys, what are you doing here?\\n\\nBen: It’s a little bit of a clown show on the operational side, even if the idea is good.\\n\\nDavid: So they end up abandoning the effort, both because they can’t raise money and because IDA has found out about this and they’re not too pleased. Shortly after all of this, though, Jim ends up moving on anyway because the Vietnam War starts and he, as you can imagine from his background, is not a supporter of the Vietnam War at this point in time.\\n\\nJim writes an op-ed in the New York Times denouncing the Vietnam War and saying like, yeah, he’s part of the defense department, but not everybody in the defense department is for the war.\\n\\nBen: Which is so naive thinking you can write an op-ed in the New York freaking times and that’s not going to create issues for you in your job.\\n\\nDavid: Even more than that, amazingly nobody really paid attention to it, except a reporter at Newsweek, who then comes to interview Jim and ask him some more questions and he just doubles down on this. When the Newsweek piece comes out, that’s when the Department of Defense is like, all right, you got to fire this guy.\\n\\nSo Jim gets fired in 1967, even though he’s a star codebreaker. He made supposedly huge contributions to the group, which are still classified, but at age 30 with a wife and three kids, he’s out on the street. Even though he’s super smart, his colleagues love him clearly, he’s now bounced out of MIT, he’s bounced out of Harvard, he’s gone to this seemingly final home for him, great place at IDA, he gets bounced out of there too. His job prospects are not great.\\n\\nHe takes pretty much the only halfway decent–paying job that he could get, which is to be the chair of the newly established or maybe reestablished Math Department at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, which is the Long Island campus of the State University of New York. This is not Harvard, this is not MIT.\\n\\nBen: No, it is not.\\n\\nDavid: But it did have one very important thing going for it, which is why Jim ended up there, and that is that Nelson Rockefeller, who was then the governor of New York, had launched a $100 million campaign to try and turn this Long Island campus of the State University of New York into a mathematical powerhouse, to become the Berkeley of the East. I thought MIT was the Berkeley of the East already, but Rockefeller is way too good a campaign that he wants Stony Brook to become a math and sciences powerhouse. And Jim is the key.\\n\\nHe wouldn’t be able to recruit somebody like Jim otherwise, but because he’s now tarnished his career, here’s a very talented mathematician that they can convince to become chair of the department. They basically give Jim an unlimited budget and leeway to go try and poach math professors from departments all over the country in the world and bring them there to Long Island.\\n\\nPart of how Jim goes and recruits folks is money. The old, hey, I’ll double your salary line. But the other part of it, too, is he’s given such leeway, and Stony Brook is so different from the politics of an MIT or a Harvard or a Princeton. He says, hey, come here. I’ll pay you more.\\n\\nBut even more importantly, you can just focus on your research. You’re not going to have to deal with committees. You’re not going to have to do all this stuff. There is none of this stuff here. You might have to teach a little bit, but that’s not even the point. Rockefeller doesn’t want this necessarily to become a great teaching institution. He just wants to assemble talent there.\\n\\nAmazingly it works. Jim starts getting a bunch of great talent, including James Ax, who is a superstar in algebra and number theory from Cornell, and he ends up at Stony Brook recruiting and building one of the best math departments in the world.\\n\\nBen: Amazing.\\n\\nDavid: Totally amazing. But in true Jim fashion, after a couple of years of this and also his marriage with Barbara falling apart, he starts getting restless again. He decides that he wants to go on a sabbatical, go back to Berkeley, reunite with his old advisor there, and go spend some time out on the coast in California.\\n\\nThis is where Chern and Simons end up collaborating and developing the Chern-Simons theory, that ends up winning the highest award in geometry from the American Mathematical Society, and really is Jim’s personal mark on mathematics.\\n\\nNow also right around the same time, remember the Colombian flooring company? It gets Acquired. Jim and his buddies who are partners in it, come into a good amount of money. Jim is newly divorced, he’s restless in academia, he has these ideas back from when he was at IDA about what you could do in the markets if you had capital. He starts trading again, and he gets more and more into it.\\n\\nMeanwhile, like we said, he is becoming disillusioned again and restless at academia. And in 1978, he leaves to focus full-time on trading, which is a huge shock to the academic community. Remember, he’s assembled this superstar team there at Stony Brook.\\n\\nThere’s a quote in Greg’s book from another mathematician at Cornell. “We looked down on him when he did this, like he had been corrupted and had sold his soul to the devil.”\\n\\nBen: It was really viewed in the math community as anyone who’s going to do investing is throwing away their talent. It wasn’t even that it was common the way that it is today.\\n\\nDavid: Jim was the first one, but the idea that you would leave to do anything commercial, you doing a disservice to humanity.\\n\\nBen: Exactly, and leaving to do anything, sure. But leaving to do investing was almost just seen as dirty, like it’s this rich person’s game that provides no value to society.\\n\\nDavid: I don’t think it was that the rest of the math world was skeptical that it could work. They probably were like, oh yeah, this could work. But they were like, eww.\\n\\nBen: Academics tend to be much more motivated by prestige than money, so I could totally see other people being like, oh, I could do that if I wanted, but I have this higher calling and everyone respects me for this higher calling. My currency is the papers I publish and the awards that I win, and that’s what I want.\\n\\nDavid: Now Stony Brook, we should say too, it’s a very nice place. But it’s in the middle of Long Island on the North Shore. This is not the Hamptons. It’s like the Long Island suburbs.\\n\\nBen: The wooded Long Island suburbs.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, the wooded Long Island suburbs. Here’s Jim in a strip mall next to a pizza joint, setting up his trading operation that he decides very cleverly to call Moneymetrics—a combination of money and metrics or econometrics. He recruits his old IDA buddy, original partner in crime on the trading idea, Lenny Baum, to come and join him. This time though, they have some capital from the sale of the flooring company.\\n\\nBen: How much did he make on that flooring sale?\\n\\nDavid: I think together with Jim, his partners, and whatever money Lenny put in, they had a little less than $4 million in this initial capital.\\n\\nBen: In 1978.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Now, Jim also has another advantage at this point in time, which is he’s right down the street from Stony Brook, and he’s just recruited all of these superstar mathematicians.\\n\\nBen: The table has been set.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and those folks are more loyal to Jim than they are to Stony Brook.\\n\\nBen: But they’re more loyal right now to academia than they are to finance. This is not a paved pathway until Jim paves this pathway.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, in general. But some of them, and in particular the superstar James Ax, Jim convinces to come join him in his trading operations.\\n\\nBen: So having Baum and Ax and Simons, it’s like suddenly this extremely credible team in the math world.\\n\\nDavid: Beyond credible.\\n\\nBen: All the theorems that a lot of mathematicians are using every day are all named after these three guys who are now at the same firm trading.\\n\\nDavid: And it’s led by Jim, who’s somebody that they respect as an academic, but even more important is somebody they want to work for, they look up to, and they think is cool. He’s out there being like, hey, I think we can make money.\\n\\nNow at this point, they’re primarily trading currencies, not stocks. Currencies are obviously large markets, but they aren’t impacted by as many signals and as many factors as stocks are, or really even slightly more complex commodities like soybeans or whatever.\\n\\nBen: And it seemed to me like a lot of the trading of currencies they were doing was basically based on feelings that they had around how a central bank was acting, like if the head of state of a certain country was going to do something or not. It’s basically like betting on how one single actor who was in control of currencies at governments would act. To your point about very few signals impacting price, it’s knowing what one person is going to do.\\n\\nDavid: And this is super important. At the end of the day, they build some models there. They’re getting the early versions, infrastructure, and scaffolding of this quantitative approach set up. But in terms of the actual trades they’re putting on, they’re still doing all of it by hand. And they’re still all really going on a fundamental type analysis.\\n\\nThey’ll take some signals from the model, they’ll see what’s interesting, what they spit out, but they’re not going to act on anything unless they can be like, oh yeah, I see what is going on here. I have a hypothesis.\\n\\nBen: The computers are by no means running loose at this point.\\n\\nDavid: By no means at all, yeah. They’re just suggesting patterns and ideas, and Jim, Lenny, and James have to then decide, hey, are we going to do this or not? Or are we going to do something just totally different that we think is what’s going to happen?\\n\\nThis actually does make sense, really for two reasons. One, computers and computing power just wasn’t sophisticated enough yet to really build AI in a way that’s powerful enough that it could work well enough, you could really trust it. That’s one part.\\n\\nThe other part is these folks are mathematicians. They’re not computer scientists. They’re really, really good at building models, decoding signals (obviously), but they’re much more from this realm of theory.\\n\\nI actually spoke with Howard Morgan who’s going to come up here in a second, and he made this point to me. He’s like, in math, there’s this concept of traceability that’s a really, really important cultural tenant. It’s like proving a proof, or proving a theorem, or something like that. You really need to understand why to get ahead in the field. It’s not like you can just say, oh, hey, the data suggests this. It’s like, no, no, no, you need proof.\\n\\nThat’s the world that these guys are coming from. They’re like, oh, we can use data to help us here, but ultimately we want to have a rock solid theory of what is fundamentally happening here.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating, which is very different from, we’ll cram a huge amount of data in, and then whatever the data suggests, we know it’s true because the data suggests it, which is where they would end up many years later once they had both the hardware you’re referring to—sophisticated computers—the clean data that would be required to make all of those incredibly numerous and fast calculations, and also the real computer engineering architecture to build these scale systems to actually act on large amounts of signals and understand them all to come up with results. They just didn’t have any of that at the time, so it was hunches and chalkboards.\\n\\nDavid: So much so that even Jim is ringleader here, he’s far from convinced that he should put all of his wealth into this thing. He’s like, ah, yeah, this is interesting. We’re building, we’re experimenting. Great. But I also want to put my money somewhere else, too, for some diversification.\\n\\nThis is where Howard Morgan comes in. We used to talk about this on old Acquired episodes that in the early days of Silicon Valley, there were only 10 people out here. They all knew each other and they were all doing the same thing. This was also the case in East Coast finance and technology, and early VC in these days. Howard Morgan would go on to be one of the co-founders of First Round Capital.\\n\\nBen: Which was essentially spun out of Renaissance? It was the venture capital work that they were doing at Renaissance that didn’t fit with the rest of Renaissance?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Here’s how it all went down, and this is so poorly understood out there. Howard was a computer science and business school professor at the University of Pennsylvania. He taught CS at Penn and business at Wharton.\\n\\nHe had been involved in bringing ARPANET to Penn and was early, early internet pioneer. As a result, he was super plugged into tech, early startups, and really early, early proto internet stuff. Jim gets excited about investing together with Howard. They say like, hey, maybe we should partner together.\\n\\nIn 1982, Jim actually winds down Moneymetrics, and he and Howard co-found a new firm together that’s going to reflect both of their backgrounds and be a great diversification. Jim and his group are going to bring in the quantitative trading thing,\\n\\nBen: And again, trading on currencies and commodities at this point.\\n\\nDavid: And Howard’s going to bring in private company technology investing. They pick a name for a firm that is going to reflect this—Renaissance Technologies.\\n\\nBen: It’s crazy.\\n\\nDavid: And that is why RenTech is called RenTech.\\n\\nBen: When we figured this out in the research, I could not believe that this is not a more widely understood story. That this is the origins of what is today a fantastic venture capital firm (First Round Capital), but you could not name two more different strategies in investing.\\n\\nA long-term illiquid thing like venture capital, highly speculative, versus we’re going to trade whether we think the French Franc is going to go up or down tomorrow based on the whim of some government leader. It’s unbelievable these were under the same roof.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. But when you know the whole background in history, it makes sense because this is their personal money. This is Jim and his buddies, Lenny, James, and Howard. There’s no institutional capital here. They’re not out pitching LPs of like, oh, you should invest in my diversified strategy of currency trading and private technology startups.\\n\\nBen: When they say multi-strategy, this is really multi-strategy.\\n\\nDavid: We’ll get into what multi-strategy today means later. But in these early days of RenTech, 50% of the portfolio was venture capital and 50% was currency trading. In fact, a couple of years after they get started, the currency trading side of the firm almost blows up when Lenny goes super long on government bonds and the market goes against him and the whole portfolio drops 40%, which is wild. That ends up triggering a clause in Lenny’s agreement with Jim, and they sell off Lenny’s entire portfolio and he leaves the firm. This is crazy. Blow up risk is always an issue in the markets, but this happened to RenTech.\\n\\nBen: And because we quickly got to this point in the story, it would be easy to say, well that’s a clause that has a lot of teeth. There were many rumbles of something like this potentially happening. Simons going to Lenny and saying, hey, maybe we should cut some of our losses and it’s okay to trade out of these positions. Lenny was just very dug in on I’m a true believer. That’s how you can get into a situation where you trigger a covenant like this.\\n\\nDavid: And again, also shows they weren’t doing model-based quantitative trading really at this point in time.\\n\\nBen: So much gut.\\n\\nDavid: As a result of that, for a while RenTech is truly almost entirely a venture capital firm. One point on the venture side, just one investment, Franklin Dictionaries, do you remember Ben? The Franklin electronic dictionaries? Yeah. That was one of their biggest investments. That one investment is half of Jim’s net worth at this low point for the trading side.\\n\\nBen: I had no idea. That’s crazy.\\n\\nDavid: In the book, Greg talks about, oh, Jim was focused on venture capital, and that’s the story out there. It’s like, well, he was focused on venture capital because that was the only thing working and making money.\\n\\nBen: It’s the only thing where they actually had an edge from Howard’s access to deal flow, because They certainly didn’t have an edge in the global currency markets.\\n\\nDavid: I think perhaps in part because of the trading losses, James Ax starts to get a little disillusioned too, and he tells Jim that he wants to move out to California with Sandor Straus, who started working with them at this point—Sandor was another Stony Brook alum that joined them—and the two of them want to move out to California and do trading out there.\\n\\nJim says, sure, fine. I’m here with Howard. I’m doing venture capital stuff. Why don’t you go move out to California? You can start your own firm, which they do—it’s called Axcom—and we’ll contract with Axcom to run what’s left of the trading operations here for RenTech.\\n\\nBen: It’s this interesting arm’s length thing where Jim strikes a deal where he’s going to own a part of Axcom in exchange for this very favorable contractual relationship where they’re going to hire them to be the manager for this pot of money that Renaissance has raised. But it’s technically not Renaissance. It’s Axcom.\\n\\nDavid: It’s another company that is now doing the quantitative trading.\\n\\nBen: And I think Jim owned a quarter of it, is that right?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, that’s right.\\n\\nBen: And importantly, I don’t think anyone had any idea what Axcom would become or how unbelievably profitable it would be.\\n\\nDavid: Nobody would’ve done what they did had they known what was coming.\\n\\nBen: Wouldn’t have spun it out.\\n\\nDavid: Once Ax and Straus get out to California, Straus is on the computing data infrastructure side. That’s what he was doing at Stony Brook, and that’s what he came into Renaissance to build. He starts getting really into data, and he starts collecting intraday pricing movements on securities.\\n\\nAt this point in time, I think really the best data you could get from providers out there was maybe open and close data on securities pricing. Straus finds a way to get tick data, like every 20 minute data on these securities throughout the day.\\n\\nBen: Not only that. He’s getting historical data that predates what your traditional data providers would give you, then ingesting it into computers and cleaning the data to get it into the same format as the tick data. He’s getting early 1900 even 1800 stuff to try to just say at some point, hopefully we’ll be able to make use of this, and I want to have this just really, really clean data set about the way that these markets interact.\\n\\nDavid: He’s doing ETL on the data (I think) before anybody knew what ETL was.\\n\\nBen: Again, no one told him to do that. That was just a self-motivated, almost obsession of, well, if we’re going to have data, it should be well-formatted, well-understood, labeled and all that.\\n\\nDavid: So that’s one thing that happens. The other thing is Jim says, oh, you’re going out to California. Let me hook you up with my buddy who’s a Berkeley professor out there, Elwyn Berlekamp. Berlekamp had studied with folks like John Nash and Claude Shannon at MIT.\\n\\nBen: I love that Claude Shannon is coming in again.\\n\\nDavid: I know.\\n\\nBen: We talked about a lot on the Qualcomm episode, father of Information Theory, really the center of gravity for attracting tons of talent to MIT, and paving the way for what would become phone technology and telecommunications broadly in the future. But the fact that Berlekamp is crossing paths at MIT with Claude Shannon, so cool.\\n\\nDavid: So cool. Most importantly for this specific use case, Berlekamp had worked with John Kelly who developed the Kelly Criterion on bet sizing, which poker players will likely be well familiar with.\\n\\nWith this combination now of much, much, much better and deeper data from Straus, and Berlekamp coming in and working with Ax on the models and saying, hey, we should be smart about the bet sizing that we’re doing in the trades that are coming out of these models, versus I don’t know what they were doing before. Maybe it was naive of every trade was the same, or we should actually be systematic about this. The models start really working.\\n\\nBen: This is the turning point.\\n\\nDavid: In these mid-80s years, Axcom is generating IRRs of 20+ percent on the trading side. Not necessarily going to beat venture capital IRRs, but liquid, reliable…\\n\\nBen: Well, that’s the thing. They don’t know how reliable yet. They know they’ve done it a few years in a row here, but the question is how uncorrelated to the stock market over a long period of time and how predictable are these returns? Or is it just super high variance?\\n\\nDavid: But the early results are really good, and Jim and Berlekamp (especially) are very encouraged by this. In 1988, Jim and Howard Morgan decide to spin out the venture investments, and Howard goes to manage those with basically their own money.\\n\\nFun coda on this. When Howard starts first round a number of years later with Josh Kopelman, Jim of course is a large LP. Howard, of course, remains an investor in RenTech.\\n\\nThe first institutional fund, that first round ended up raising, was a 50X on $125 million fund. It had Roblox, Uber, and Square. I believe this is right. I think Jim made as much money from his investments in first round as Howard did from his LP stake in RenTech.\\n\\nBen: That’s wild.\\n\\nDavid: Isn’t that amazing?\\n\\nBen: Wow. That is an untold story about Jim Simons. I think I read basically every primary source thing on Jim or Renaissance on the whole internet, but I assume you got that from Howard.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. It was super fun talking to Howard about this, and just the history of how First Round started at early super angel investing and everything that became.\\n\\nBen: I also didn’t realize that First Round’s Fund I was a 50X on $125 million fund.\\n\\nDavid: First institutional fund, which I believe they called Fund II.\\n\\nBen: Wild, wild stuff.\\n\\nDavid: Totally wild. When Howard spins out the venture activities, Jim then decides to set up a new fund as a joint venture between RenTech and Axcom. They decide to name it after all of the collective mathematical awards that Jim, James, Berlekamp, and all these prestigious mathematicians have won in their careers. They name it the Medallion fund.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, we’ve arrived. This is the part of the story that matters. The Medallion fund is the crown jewel, or you might even say, actually the only interesting thing about Renaissance, and it is born out of this observation that, oh my God, what they’re doing over there at Axcom is really interesting. Maybe they shouldn’t be doing it all the way over there. Maybe that should be a deeper part of the fold here at RenTech and we shouldn’t have let that get away, or frankly given up on the quantitative trading strategies too early.\\n\\nAnd again, still just currencies, still just commodities futures, not playing the stock market at all. But the seeds and the ideas, the huge amount of clean data, the robust engineering infrastructure to process all that data, the mining of signals from data to figure out what trading strategies to execute, that is really starting to form here in this new joint venture, this Medallion fund.\\n\\nDavid: Those ideas had all existed before. This is the first time that it’s all brought together, and actually working and operationalized.\\n\\nBen: And frankly, that computers got good enough to actually do it, too. That’s another big piece of this.\\n\\nDavid: I don’t know that Straus could have done his data engineering too much earlier in time. But before we get into the just absolutely insane run that this Medallion fund is about to go on, that continues right through to this day, now is the perfect time for another story about ServiceNow. ServiceNow is one of our big partners here in season 14 and is just an incredible company.\\n\\nBen: ServiceNow digitally transforms your enterprise, helping automate processes, improve service delivery, and increase operational efficiency all in one intelligent platform. Over 85% of the Fortune 500 runs on them, and they have quickly joined the Microsofts and the NVIDIAs as one of the most important enterprise software companies in the world today.\\n\\nDavid: We talked on our Novo Nordisk episode about how ServiceNow founder, Fred Luddy, discovered this core insight that software can transform and eliminate manual tasks. And on Hermes, we told the story of how current CEO Bill McDermott came in and turbocharged that into an absolute monster $150 billion market cap global behemoth.\\n\\nThe key thread that connects those two eras is that from day one, Fred knew the ServiceNow platform could be used across the whole enterprise. But at the same time, he also knew from his decades of prior software experience that launching a broad, horizontal offering right out of the gate as a startup was a recipe for failure. You need to start with a specific vertical use case. And in this case, he chose IT service management.\\n\\nBen: And that’s been true for us here on Acquired, too. David, if we didn’t name it Acquired and cover technology acquisitions that actually went well, we never could have broadened and become the podcast that tells the stories of great companies. You can’t just start as that.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: This is what’s so cool and where I think the playbook lesson really is for listeners, because you can’t just pick any use case. You have to be strategic about it. IT was the perfect vertical because every other department has to interface with them from the CEO on down.\\n\\nThey’re going to notice when IT’s service management rapidly improves. All of those support tickets that used to take forever are now just magically resolved. That greases the wheels for the other departments to say, hey, maybe we should adopt ServiceNow to turbocharge and digitally transform our service levels, too.\\n\\nDavid: Once those other departments do pull the trigger on joining the ServiceNow platform, who is in charge of rolling it out for them? Of course, it’s IT who are already true ServiceNow believers.\\n\\nI’m honestly not sure that there’s a better enterprise software playbook in history than ServiceNow’s. Once they established the beachhead in IT, they then took the same platform to HR with employee experience, they took it to CSM with customer service requests, they took it to finance with regulatory reporting, audit and expense approvals, and now they’re adding AI, which will take everything to the next level.\\n\\nBen: If you want to learn more about the ServiceNow platform and playbook, and hear how it can transform your business, head on over to servicenow.com/acquired. When you get in touch, just tell them that Ben and David sent you.\\n\\nDavid: So they’ve got this grand new plan and vision with the Medallion fund. Unfortunately, right out of the gate, the fund stumbles a bit, and Ax ends up getting burned out. Berlekamp though is like, no, no, no, no. This is an anomaly. Like we’re going to fix this. I really, really believe that what we’re doing with these models is going to be extremely profitable.\\n\\nHe buys out most of Ax’s stake in the summer of 1989, and he moves the offices up to Berkeley. There he comes up with the idea that, hey, we should trade more frequently, a lot more frequently, because if what we’re trying to do is understand the state of the market from the data we have and then predict the future state of the market, and then combine that with figuring out the right bet sizing to make. We actually want to make a lot more trades to get a lot more data points, and learn a lot more about the bets we’re making so that we can then size them up or size them down.\\n\\nBen: It’s that, and it’s two other things. One is the further into the future you look, the less certain you can be about it. If you know something is worth $10 right now, what you know five minutes from now is it’s probably going to be worth about $10. The most likely situation is it’s within 5% of that. If you ask me three years from now, I have almost no intuition about that. A state machine is the same way. If you flash forward a whole bunch of states, you lose predictability as you continue down that chain.\\n\\nThe second thing is, if your models are showing that you’re going to be right, call it something like 50.25% of the time, then the amount of money you can make is gated by the number of bets you can make at a quarter percent edge.\\n\\nIf I walk up to the casino and I think I’m right about this particular roulette wheel, which of course you’re not 50.25% of the time, and I decide to play once or play twice or play five times, there’s a chance I could lose all my money. Or if I have tiny little bet sizes, then I’m just not going to make that much money. But if I walk up to said game with a little bit of edge, and I use small bet sizes, and I play 10,000 times, I’m going to walk out with a lot of money.\\n\\nDavid: There is a great Bob Mercer quote about this later. He says, “We are right 50.75% of the time.”\\n\\nBen: And I do think he’s making up that number. I think it’s illustrative.\\n\\nDavid: But we’re 100% right, 50.75% of the time. You can make billions that way.\\n\\nBen: It’s so true. When you have that little edge, it’s about making sure that you’re not betting so much, that a few bets that don’t break your way can take you down to zero and to make sure you can just play the game a lot.\\n\\nDavid: A lot, yes. And then back to the Kelly criterion, adjust your bet sizes over time as you’re making those bets.\\n\\nBen: Now of course, this is all great in the abstract. If it’s that you’re literally sitting at a casino, you’re somehow perfectly making these bets, and you’re just sitting right there at the table and then you can walk over to the cashier. It gets a little bit different in the market.\\n\\nFor example, there are real transaction costs, especially at this point in history, before some of these more innovative trading business models with pay for order flow and zero transaction fees and all this stuff. There are real transaction costs to putting on these trades. And of course you’re going to move the market when you put on these trades.\\n\\nDavid: This is slippage.\\n\\nBen: There are all sorts of practical consideration. You could get front run by other people. It’s not just a computer program that gets executed. You actually have to meet the constraints of the real world when you’re deciding instead of a few big bets, we’re going to have a hundred thousand tiny bets.\\n\\nDavid: And as time goes on and the whole quant industry emerges and becomes much more sophisticated, I think it’s particularly the slippage there that becomes the governor on how high velocity you can actually be on this. And the slippage is that once you are at a certain scale, you are going to move the market with your trades.\\n\\nBen: So the deeper you get into the order book, like let’s say you want to buy $5 million of something, maybe your first $100,000 you’re pretty sure you can get the quoted price, but by your last $100,000 of that $5 million buy, the price might have gotten pretty different already.\\n\\nDavid: We’re going to come back to this in just a minute, but this certainly for early RenTech, and then even now still for all of quantitative finance, is a really, really, really important thing.\\n\\nBen: And David, in a very crude way, calls back to last episode on Hermes, the idea that the price would be highest for the family member that is willing to sell now and goes down over time. If the family was going to sell to Bernard Arnault, it would behoove you to be first in the order book, not last in the order book.\\n\\nDavid: I feel like there’s this meta lesson that I’ve been learning through Acquired and my own personal investing over the past couple of years. Every market is dependent on supply and demand. You can see quoted valuations and quoted price streams, but oftentimes that’s the mistake of just looking at averages.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. Looking at the quoted price of an asset is wrong. You actually should be looking at what is the volume that is willing to buy and what is the volume that is willing to sell. And for all of those buyers and all of those sellers, what is the price at which they’re willing to transact?\\n\\nThe way that tends to manifest on a stock chart is here’s the price of the share right now. But that’s not actually what’s going on under the surface. It’s a whole bunch of buyers and sellers who have different willingness to pay and have different amounts that they’re trying to buy or sell.\\n\\nDavid: Now, at this point in time, when the Medallion fund is first starting to work in (say) late 1989, early 1990, it’s small enough that this isn’t a big consideration yet. Medallion was about $27 million under management when Berlekamp bought out Ax. In 1990 the first full year after that, the fund gains 77.8% gross, which, after fees and carry was 55% net. Now, what were the fees and carry?\\n\\nBen: Either one of those numbers is shooting the freaking lights out, assuming that this is not a crazy high risk strategy that they executed and will completely fall apart under different market conditions. If this is an actual repeatable strategy that produces the numbers you just said, unbelievable. World-changing.\\n\\nDavid: Hell yeah, let’s go. And indeed it was a ‘hell yeah, let’s go’ situation.\\n\\nBen: The numbers you quoted me, the gross and the net, sounded quite different. Talk to me about the fees and carry.\\n\\nDavid: Carry, I’ve seen different sources of whether it was 20% or 25% in the early days. But the management fee on the fund was 5%, which is crazy. The top venture capital firms in the world charge a 3% management fee, and even that is like everybody holds their nose and are like, this is ridiculous. How on earth were these nobodies charging a 5% management fee out the gate to their investors? Well, a couple of things. One, their investors were not sophisticated. It was mostly their own money and their buddy’s money.\\n\\nBen: So they set that precedent.\\n\\nDavid: They set that precedent. But two, though, they actually needed the money. Straus’ infrastructure costs were about $800,000 a year. So they just backed into the management fee based on like, hey, we need $800,000 a year to run the infrastructure, plus we need some money to pay folks and whatnot. Great, 5% management fee.\\n\\nBen: And the pitch they’re making to the investor base is like, if you believe that we should be able to massively outperform the market doing quantitative trading, well we’re going to need a lot of fees to do that. So the investors basically took the deal if they thought about it enough.\\n\\nOkay, so that’s the fees. On the performance, that 20% or 25%, it’s just not actually that far above market, if it’s above market at all. What you’re seeing is a high fee, normal-ish performance fee fund at this point in time.\\n\\nDavid: High management fee, normal-ish carrier performance element.\\n\\nAt the end of 1990, Simons is so jazzed about what’s going on that he tells Berlekamp, hey, you should move here to Long Island. Let’s recentralize everything here. I want to go all in on this. I think with some tweaks, we can be up 80% after fees next year.\\n\\nBerlekamp is a little more circumspect. (a) He wants to stay in Berkeley, he doesn’t have any desire to move to Long Island, and (b) I couldn’t tell how much of this is just, he’s a little more conservative than Jim, or how much of this actually might be his, hey, whole poker bet sizing thing.\\n\\nHe turns to Jim and he says, well, if you’re so optimistic, why don’t you buy me out? So Jim does at 6X the basis that Berlekamp had paid Ax a year earlier.\\n\\nBen: On the one hand, making a 6X in one year sounds great.\\n\\nDavid: On the other hand, this is the equivalent of when Don Valentine sold Sequoia’s Apple stake before the IPO to lock in a great gain, but miss out on all the upside to come.\\n\\nBen: David, I think we should throw this out so people understand the volume of this. They’ve generated on the order of $60 billion of performance fees for the owners of the fund over their entire lifetime. On the one hand, 6X in a year isn’t bad. On the other hand, you owned a giant part of something that has dividend $60 billion in cash out to its owners.\\n\\nDavid: That’s just on the carry side. The owners are the principles. So just like dollars out of the firm, it’s probably twice that. I would estimate probably $150–$200 billion that have come out of Medallion over the last 35 years.\\n\\nJim buys out Berlekamp, he rolls everything in the Medallion fund back into RenTech itself, moves everything back to Stony Brook, Straus moves to Stony Brook.\\n\\nBen: So it’s now the Jim Simons show in New York, with Straus building the engineering systems, and Ax (I think) still had a small stake.\\n\\nDavid: That’s right. And Straus had a stake as well. Once Jim takes control and moves everything back, he basically decides that he’s going to turn RenTech into an even better, even more idealized version of IDA and the math department at Stony Brook. He’s going to make this an academic’s paradise, where if you are one of the absolute smartest mathematicians or systems engineers in the world, this is where you want to be.\\n\\nOf course he starts raiding the Stony Brook department itself again. This is when Henry Laufer joins full-time. Laufer had been consulting with Medallion in the early days and working with Berlekamp as they’re doing bet sizing as they’re making more frequent trades. But now, once the whole operation is moved back to Long Island Laufer’s like, oh, okay, great. I’ll come full time. I’m here at Stony Brook anyway. This is way more fun than teaching.\\n\\nBen: And listeners, I imagine this is probably the point where you’re starting to get confused and saying, there are so many people in this story. I think we’re on eight or nine. We just keep introducing more people.\\n\\nThat is the story of Renaissance. It is not this singular clean narrative. It is a very complex reality of a whole bunch of different people that came in and out at different eras, where the firm was trying different things, and eventually became phenomenally successful with a very particular approach. But while they were figuring it out along the way, it took a lot of people.\\n\\nDavid: And just a lot of time, too. This is 25 years, this is a quarter century. From the time that Baum and Simons write the paper at IDA until Medallion really starts to work. It takes a long time.\\n\\nBen: And we haven’t even introduced the two people who would become the co-CEOs of this company for 20 years.\\n\\nDavid: Well, let’s get to that. So Jim moves everything back to Long Island, sets it up as this academic paradise, is recruiting the smartest people in the world. In 1991, the next year, the firm does 54.3% gross returns and 39.4% net returns after fees. Not Jim’s bogey of 80%, but still pretty freaking great.\\n\\nBen: We should say the years of modest performance are behind them. From every single year forward, they shoot the lights out. From 1990 onward, they never lose money. And on a gross basis, they never even do less than 30%. It’s working, it’s going. The whole rest of the story is about, hold on, keep the machine working, and we’re on the train.\\n\\nDavid: The historic run has begun, let’s just say. So 1992 gross returns are 47%, 1993, they’re 54%. At the end of 1993, Simons decides to close the fund and not allow new LPs in. If you’re an existing LP, you can stay in, but they’re no longer open for new inflows. He has so much confidence in what they’re doing that he thinks they’re all going to make more money without accepting new capital by just keeping it to the existing investor base.\\n\\n1994 gross returns are 93 freaking percent. Medallion at this point is stacking up cash. It is a meaningful fund. It’s about $250 million total at this point in time, which is small, but we’re talking about 1994 with a bunch of outsiders and academics that have managed to amass a quarter billion dollars here. People start to pay attention.\\n\\nBen: And the performance fees on this are $7 million, $13 million, $52 million. The free cash flow flowing to partners here is certainly becoming real too.\\n\\nDavid: But as they get into that—call it on the order of magnitude of a billion dollar scale—they start bumping into the moving markets problem and the slippage that we were talking about earlier.\\n\\nBen: And that’s in the mid-90s?\\n\\nDavid: Yup. As they’re hitting this $250 million–$½ billion scale.\\n\\nBen: The computer model spits out, we should go buy this huge amount of something at this price. They go to do it, they can only buy 10%, 20%, 30% of the amount they want at that price, and then suddenly the price is very different.\\n\\nDavid: Up to this point, the vast majority of what Medallion is doing is trading currencies and commodities, not equities. Because you might be thinking, okay, yeah, I hear you. The 90s was a different era, but a $½ billion fund doesn’t sound that big. How are they moving markets with $½ billion?\\n\\nBen: It’s not the equity markets.\\n\\nDavid: It’s because they’re in these thinner markets. It’s not that commodities and futures are small markets. They’re large, but they’re thin compared to equities. There’s just not that much volume, and you just can’t trade that much without slippage becoming a huge issue. And Medallion is now hitting that limit.\\n\\nSimons decides the only thing we can do here to expand—which I’m such a believer in what we’re doing, we need to expand—is we need to move into equities. Equities are the holy grail. If we can make this work there, the depth in those markets will let us scale way, way, way bigger than we are now. And there’s so much more data about equities, pricing that we can feed into our models and the signal processing that we can do in the signals that we can find are going to be even better.\\n\\nBen: There are so many buyers and sellers every day showing up to trade so many different companies at such high velocity. It’s almost this honeypot for Renaissance’s systems. This is their moment. This is what they were built for. And it’s funny that they’ve just been in kid glove land the whole time with these thinly-traded markets with minimal data.\\n\\nDavid: This brings us to Peter Brown and Bob Mercer. In 1993, one of the mathematicians that Jim had recruited to RenTech, a guy named Nick Patterson, gets especially passionate about going out and recruiting new talent along with Jim. And this is (I think) one of the keys to RenTech and the culture there. People want other smart people to come be there, too. Nick sitting there like, this is a joy. I want to go find other best people in the world to hang out with.\\n\\nHe had read in the newspaper that IBM was going through cost-cutting and was about to do layoffs. He also knew that the speech recognition group at IBM had some absolutely fantastic mathematical talent. Really what they were doing was, again, another vector in the early AI machine learning research, specifically IBM’s Deep Blue chess project of the time had come out of this group. Peter Brown there was the one that actually spearheaded the project.\\n\\nBen: It’s interesting that you talk about speech recognition as the perfect fit for what they were doing. You might say, why is that? Well, the actual work that goes into speech recognition, natural language processing is kind of the same signal processing that Renaissance is doing to analyze the market.\\n\\nDavid: It’s not just kind of. It’s exactly the same signal processing.\\n\\nBen: Speech recognition is a hidden Markov process where the computer that’s listening to the sounds to try to turn it into language doesn’t actually know English, right? Obviously. But what it does know is when I hear this set of frequencies and tonalities and sounds, there’s a limited set of likely things that could come after it.\\n\\nIn Greg’s book, he greatly points out this perfect example. When I say apple, you might say pie. The probability that pie is going to be the next word following apple is significantly higher, so these people who have spent their careers not only doing the math and the theoretical computer science behind speech recognition to help figure out and predict the next words that you have a narrow set of likely words to choose from, so when you’re listening to those frequencies, you can say it’s probably going to be one of these three, rather than search the entire dictionary for any word that it could be to narrow the processing power. It’s not only the theoretical side, but it’s also people who have built those systems at IBM, like a real operational computer company.\\n\\nDavid: At operational scale. This is what’s so important and why the two of them become probably the most critical hires in RenTech’s history, even including all the great academics that came before them, because they’re good on the math side, but they have this large systems experience.\\n\\nJim and Nick know that if they’re going to move into equities, because of the volume of data and because of how much more complex that market is, they need more complex systems. And the current talent at RenTech coming from academia has just never experienced that or built anything like it.\\n\\nBen: The world that they’re entering is just exploding in complexity and dimensionality. When I say that, here’s what I mean. The data that they are mining, that they’re looking for is this intraday tick data between every stock trading. They’re trying to map the relationship between one stock and every other stock, not just at that moment in time, but every time before and every time after it.\\n\\nThey’re also, once they do identify patterns, which this is key, the algorithms identify the patterns. It’s not a human with a hunch saying, I think when oil prices go up, the airline prices are going to get hit. It’s computers doing machine learning to discover the patterns in the data.\\n\\nThen there’s the second piece of, well, what trades do you actually put on to be profitable from the probabilities that you just discovered? All these weights of relationships between all of these different companies.\\n\\nYou’re not just putting on one trade, you’re putting on 10, 100, thousands of simultaneous trades both to hedge, to be able to isolate some particular variable that you’re looking for—again, not you, but a computer is looking for—and you also need to do it in such specific bite sizes so that you don’t move the market.\\n\\nYou’re looking for a super multi-variate, multi-dimensional problem, both on the data ingestion side and on the how-do-I-actually-react-to-it side. All of this computation can’t take a long time because you must act, not in milliseconds. It’s not a high frequency trading that’s front running the market. That’s not actually what they do. A lot of people think it is, but we’ll get to that later. But they do need to act with reasonable quickness probably in the order of minutes. So these need to be really efficient computer systems too.\\n\\nDavid: And the universe of equities is so much more multidimensional and interrelated. There are only so many currencies in the world, and there are especially only so many currencies that are large enough trading markets that you can operate in. There’s not infinite, but thousands and thousands of equities in the world that are deep enough markets that you can operate in. And to some degree they’re all correlated with one another.\\n\\nBen: And just keep adding layers of complexity here. Keep adding new things to multiply by. Many of these are traded on multiple exchanges. So you might also be looking for pricing disparities on the same equity on different markets at different points in time. There are just dimensions upon dimensions of things to analyze, correlate, and act upon.\\n\\nDavid: So Patterson and Simons go raid IBM. They’re like Steve Jobs raiding Xerox Parc. They bring Peter, Bob, and one of their programming colleagues, David Magerman over from IBM into RenTech, and they get started on building the equities model.\\n\\nBut it turns out they’re obviously very successful at that, but the impact that they have and what they build is even bigger because Bob and Peter realized that, hey, actually we should just have one model for everything here. For currencies, for commodities, for equities, everything is correlated. Everything is a signal.\\n\\nIt’s not like the equities market is wholly independent and separate from what’s happening in currencies or what’s happening in commodities. There are relationships everywhere. We really want just one model. This is like a fantastical undertaking, especially in the early- to mid-90s.\\n\\nBen: But if you can nail it, it means that you can do interesting things like, hey, we don’t have a lot of data on this particular market, but it looks a lot like something we do have data on, so if it’s all part of the same model, we can just apply all the learnings from this other thing onto this brand new thing that we’re looking at with little data for the first time. And because we’re putting it all in one model and no one else in the world is, we can discover patterns that no one else knows about.\\n\\nDavid: It turns out that this was actually the second most important innovation that Bob and Peter bring to RenTech, the actual product and performance of having one model.\\n\\nThe most important thing is that if you have only one model, one infrastructure, everybody in the firm is working on that same model. You can all collaborate all together, which is especially important when you have the smartest people in the entire world all in one building.\\n\\nBefore this, there were separate models within RenTech. Insights, innovations, and work that one team was doing on one model wouldn’t get applied or translate over to work that was happening by another team on another model.\\n\\nBen: They did have the cultural element where it was encouraged that you share your learnings, but someone would have to take the time during their lunch break and go learn from you about those and then implement it in their version. There’s a lag and it may actually not get implemented.\\n\\nDavid: This is wholly unique and revolutionary. No other at-scale investment firm, period, and especially quant firm operates this way today with just one model. Their portfolio managers, teams, and multi-strategy people are culturally competitive with one another, but even if they’re not, the work that you’re doing on this side of Citadel is not impacting the work that you’re doing on that side of Citadel. What Bob and Peter do is they unify everything at RenTech, so all the wood is going behind one arrow.\\n\\nBen: And before we talk about the impact of that, we want to thank our longtime friend of the show, Vanta, the leading trust management platform. Vanta, of course, automates your security reviews and compliance efforts, so frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance and monitoring, which is quite topical if you are in the heavily regulated finance industry and you need a lot of security and compliance. Vanta takes care of these otherwise incredibly time- and resource training–efforts for your organization and makes them fast and simple.\\n\\nDavid: Vanta is the perfect example of the quote that we talk about all the time here on Acquired—Jeff Bezos, his idea that a company should only focus on what actually makes your beer taste better, i.e., spend your time and resources only on what’s actually going to move the needle for your product and your customers, and outsource everything else that doesn’t.\\n\\nIn RenTech’s case, this would be the model. Every company needs compliance and trust with their vendors and customers. It plays a major role in enabling revenue because customers and partners demand it, but yet it adds zero flavor to your actual product.\\n\\nBen: Vanta takes care of all of it for you. No more spreadsheets, no fragmented tools, no manual reviews to cobble together your security and compliance requirements. It is one single software pane of glass, just like one model that connects to all of your services via APIs and eliminates countless hours of work for your organization.\\n\\nThere are now AI capabilities to make this even more powerful, and they even integrate with over 300 external tools. Plus they let customers build private integrations with their internal systems.\\n\\nDavid: And perhaps most importantly, your security reviews are now real time instead of static, so you can monitor and share with your customers and partners to give them added confidence.\\n\\nBen: So whether you’re a startup or a large enterprise, and your company is ready to automate compliance and streamline security reviews like Vanta’s 7000 customers around the globe and go back to making your beer taste better, head on over to vanta.com/acquired and just tell them that Ben and David sent you. And thanks to friend of the show, Christina, Vanta CEO, all Acquired listeners, get $1000 of free credit. vanta.com/acquired.\\n\\nSo David, the equities machine.\\n\\nDavid: And indeed a machine it is. Peter and Bob come in in 1993, and 1994–1995 they’re building this. RenTech is getting into equities.\\n\\nBen: Just imagine the computers that you were using during 1994 and 1995. It is astonishing the level of computational complexity, coordination, and results that they are pulling off, again in real time, analyzing these markets with the technology that was available during those years.\\n\\nDavid: Here’s what’s amazing. Returns go down maybe slightly, certainly a bit from the blowout year that 1994 was, but they’re still above 30% every single year, most years above 40%.\\n\\nThis is unbelievable that they’re maintaining this performance as they’re going into this hugely more complex market, and they’re scaling assets under management. By the end of the 1990s, Medallion has almost $2 billion in assets under management while maintaining roughly the same performance by getting into equities. This is huge.\\n\\nBen: And David, if you just look at this and do the math, okay, so 94, their AUM was $276 million and they grew 93%. Then their AUM the next year was $462 million and then they grew 52%. Then their AUM the next year was $637 million. You quickly get where I’m going here, which is, oh, they’re scaling AUM not by bringing in new investors.\\n\\nDavid: It’s closed to new investors.\\n\\nIt’s all just compounding. This is the same capital that they had in 1993 that has gone from $122 million at the beginning of that year to 1999 being $1.5 billion.\\n\\nDavid: And then in the year 2000, they just totally blow the doors off. A hundred twenty-eight percent gross returns, net returns after fees of 98.5%. This is bananas.\\n\\nBen: They grow the fund from $1.9 billion to $3.8 billion of assets under management. Again, purely by investing gains, not by getting any new investors the year the tech bubble burst.\\n\\nDavid: While the whole rest of the market is down big time, Medallion is up 128% gross on the year. This becomes a theme. High volatility is when Medallion really shines.\\n\\nBen: And here you go, uncorrelated. They have their final stamp of approval right here of not only are we a money printing machine, we are a money printing machine in all environments regardless of the state of the broad market.\\n\\nDavid, as you said, volatility actually makes their algorithms work even better, because what are they doing? They’re looking for scenarios where the market’s going to act erratically, and they can take advantage of people making decisions that they shouldn’t. Anytime any investors are under pressure, there’s a little bit of edge that’s going to accrue to a Medallion that’s saying, oh, okay, you’re fear-selling right now. Well, I can determine if you should be fear-selling or not. If I determine that you shouldn’t be dumping that asset, I’m buying it from you.\\n\\nDavid: There’s a really fun story around this that really illustrates Jim’s genius in managing the firm and the people, and how this year was when they really figured this out. The first couple of days of the tech bubble bursting, Medallion actually takes a bunch of large losses.\\n\\nPart of it might be that the model wasn’t tuned right yet because nobody at RenTech had seen this type of behavior in the market before. Part of it might also be, too, that it didn’t perform well for those couple of days. It’s a really stressful time for everybody.\\n\\nEverybody’s in Jim’s office. Jim’s smoking his cigarettes, it’s a cloud of smoke, they’re debating what to do, and Jim makes the call to take some risk off. He’s worried about blowing up. We’re not very far removed at this point from long-term capital management. The model may be saying we should stay long here, but let’s not blow up the firm.\\n\\nAfter this goes down, Peter Brown comes to Jim and offers to resign given the losses that they incurred over these couple of days. Jim says, what are you talking about? Of course you shouldn’t resign. You are way more valuable to the firm now that you’ve lived through this, and you now know not to 100% trust the model in all situations.\\n\\nBen: It’s fascinating. It’s such a good insight. That illustrates Jim as a leader right there.\\n\\nDavid: It totally does. There’s a parallel story when Jim ultimately does retire in 2009, and Peter and Bob take over as co-CEOs, where a year or so before the “quant quake” had happened, where similar to the tech bubble bursting, there was, all of a sudden, very large drawdowns among all quantitative firms in the market and RenTech gets hit.\\n\\nDuring that period, Peter argued very strenuously that we should trust the model, stay risk on, this is going to be an incredibly profitable time for us. Jim pumped the brakes and stepped in, intervened, and took risk off. Peter goes to Jim, again around the CEO transition and says, Hey Jim, aren’t you worried that with me running the place now, I’m going to be too aggressive and blow it up one of these days? Jim says, no, I’m not worried at all. I know you were only so aggressive in that moment because I was there pushing back on you. And when you’re in the seat, you’re going to be less aggressive. He’s just such a master at insight into human behavior.\\n\\nBen: It is so true, though. I even find this about myself, that I will naturally take the position of the foil to the person across from me. So if somebody’s being pushy in some way, I’ll find myself taking a position where if I pause and reflect, I’m like, I don’t think I expected to take this position coming into this conversation. But you know you naturally want to play the other side to balance out the person sitting across from you.\\n\\nDavid: Back to the year 2000 in this incredible performance. Ben, to what you were saying earlier about uncorrelated returns, not only did they shoot the lights out that year, they’re doing it when the market is down.\\n\\nWe got to introduce this concept of a Sharpe ratio now, which for all of you listeners that are in the finance world, you’ll know this, but for everybody else this is a really important concept.\\n\\nBen: I think people grasp it intuitively. We’ve mentioned this concept a couple of times this episode where, okay, great, it’s amazing to have a fund that 25X’s, or a year where you have a 100% investment return, or I bought Bitcoin yesterday and it doubled overnight.\\n\\nDoes that make you one of the best investors in the world? We all intuitively know, no it doesn’t, because maybe that was a fluke, maybe you’re taking on an extreme amount of risk, and then the question is always adjusting for the risk that you’re taking. Can you produce a superior return taking the risk into that account?\\n\\nYou basically can provide value to investors as a fund manager in two ways. You can outperform the market, or you can be entirely uncorrelated with the market and get market returns. Or what you can do, as RenTech is, both. You can be uncorrelated and massively outperform, which is effectively the holy grail of money management.\\n\\nDavid: The Sharpe ratio is a measurement combining these two concepts.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. It’s named after the economist William F. Sharpe. It was pioneered in 1966. It is effectively the measure of a fund’s performance relative to the risk-free rate. If you performed at 15% that year and the risk-free rate was 3%, then you know your numerator is going to be 12%.\\n\\nIt is compared against the volatility (or the standard deviation is technically what it is), but effectively, how volatile have you been the last X years? Typically, it’s looked at as a 3-year Sharpe or a 5-year Sharpe or a 10-year Sharpe. The Sharpe ratio represents the additional amount of return that an investor receives per unit of an increase in risk.\\n\\nDavid, you’re starting to throw out numbers. Low Sharpe ratios are bad. Negative Sharpe ratios are worse because that means you’re underperforming the risk-free rate. High Sharpe ratios are good because it means that you’re producing lots of returns, and your variance or your standard deviation or your risk is low.\\n\\nSo in 1990 they had a Sharpe of 2.0, which was twice that of the S&P 500 benchmark. Awesome. 1995 to 2000, Sharpe ratio of 2.5 really starting to hum. Pretty unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: Good. Where do I sign up to invest?\\n\\nBen: At some point they added foreign markets and achieved a Sharpe ratio of 6.3, which is double the best quant firms. This is a firm that has almost no chance of losing money, at least historically, and massively outperforms the market on an uncorrelated basis.\\n\\nDavid: I believe if I have my research right, in 2004, they actually achieved a Sharpe ratio of 7.5.\\n\\nBen: Astonishing.\\n\\nDavid: Again, back to our sports analogy here, these aren’t hall of fame numbers. These make Tom Brady look like a third stringer.\\n\\nBen: Exactly.\\n\\nDavid: On the back of 2000 and this rise, the next year in 2001, they raise the carried interest on the fund to 36% up from either 20% or 25% whatever it was before. Now remember, they’ve already closed the fund to new investors. There are still outside investors in the fund, but no new investors are coming in.\\n\\nThen the next year in 2002, they raised the carry to 44%. Great work if you can get it, but for context, the Sequoia and the Benchmarks out there, they have obscene carry of 30%, 44% is unprecedented.\\n\\nBen: There are two interesting ways to look at this. One, they’re just trying to jack it up so high that they just purge their existing investors out where they’re saying, we’re not going to kick anyone out yet, but we’ve been closed to new business for a long time now. You should see yourself out at some point.\\n\\nThe other way to look at this, which I think is probably the right way to look at it, is investors are arbitragers. They see a mispricing, they come into the market, they fix that mispricing. Anytime that there’s an opportunity to bring the way that a currency is trading on two different exchanges closer together, investors are serving their purpose of coming in, arbitraging that difference, taking a little bit of profit as a thank you, and then fixing the market to make the market a true weighing machine. Not a voting machine, but making it so that all prices reflect the value of what something is actually worth.\\n\\nIn some ways, that’s what Renaissance is doing here to themselves or to their investors. They’re coming in and saying, look, this is obscene. We so clearly outperform the market, you’re still going to take this deal even if we take more of this because there’s just a mispricing here. This product should not be priced at 20%–25% carry. This product should be priced at a much higher carried interest, and you’re still going to love it.\\n\\nDavid: You should pay 20% carry for a firm that delivers you 15% annual returns. We’re delivering you 50% annual returns.\\n\\nBen: Totally. I have to imagine it didn’t go over well with the existing investors, but they just have so much leverage that what’s going to happen?\\n\\nDavid: Once again, I’m sorry audience. I have to say hold on one more minute for another perspective that I have to offer on the carry element. I want to finish the story first. 2001, they raised the carry to 36%, 2002, they raise it to 44%, and then in 2003 they actually say, hey, we can’t incentivize you out of the fund outside investors. We are going to kick you out. Starting in 2003, everybody who’s an outside investor, who’s not part of the RenTech, family—current employee or alumni of the firm—gets kicked out\\n\\nBen: And not all alumni get to stay. There are select alumni that get grandfathered in.\\n\\nDavid: Now why did we do this? I’m going to talk about one reason in a minute. One reason is super obvious. The Medallion fund is now at $5 billion in assets under management that they’re trading. Even in the equities market, they are now hitting up against slippage. If they want to maintain this crazy, crazy performance, they just can’t get that much bigger.\\n\\nBen: This is the problem that Warren Buffett talks about all the time, and why he has to basically just increase his position in Apple rather than going and buying the next great family-owned business. The things that move the needle for them are so big, that that’s really all they can do. And when you are big, you’re going to move any market that you enter into. The strategy that RenTech is employing right now, they’re just deeming doesn’t work at north of $5 billion.\\n\\nDavid: In 2003, they start kicking all the outside investors out of Medallion. But clearly there are still lots of institutional demand to invest with Renaissance. What do they do?\\n\\nBen: Time to start another fund. They start the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund. There are a couple of things to add a little bit of context to really why they decide to do this.\\n\\nThe first one is sometimes there are just more profitable strategies than they had the capital to take advantage of in Medallion, but they weren’t sure it would be on a durable basis. If they were sure that they could manage $10, $15, $20, $25 billion in Medallion all the time, then they would grow to that. But just sometimes there are these strategies that appear, oh, we don’t want to commit to a much higher fund size and then not always have those strategies available.\\n\\nThe other thing is that a lot of the times, those strategies aren’t really what Medallion is set up to do. They require longer hold times. There’s a little bit of downside to that because these new strategies, the predictive abilities are less because they have to predict further into the future to understand what the exit prices will be on these longer term holds. But they still figure, hey, even though it’s not quite our bread and butter with the short-term stuff, we should be able to make some money doing it.\\n\\nDavid: There’s a fun story around this that Peter Brown tells. Jim came into his office one day and said, Peter, I got a thought exercise for you. If you married a Rockefeller, would you advise the family that they should invest a large portion of their wealth in the S&P 500? Peter says, no, of course not. That’s not a great risk adjusted return.\\n\\nBen: And these guys are very used to Sharpe ratios that are far better than the S&P.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Jim says, yes, exactly. Now get to work on designing the product that they should invest in.\\n\\nBen: That’s basically what they come up with. Can we create something that’s like an S&P 500 with a higher Sharpe ratio? Can we beat the market by a few percentage points, or frankly even match the market each year with lower volatility than if they were buying an index fund?\\n\\nYou can see who this would be very attractive to—pensions, large institutions, firms that want to compound at market or slightly above market rate, but don’t want to risk these massive drawdowns or frankly just big volatility in general should they need to pull the capital earlier. The nice thing about being invested in a hedge fund versus a venture fund is you can do redemptions.\\n\\nIf you look at the 13Fs, the SEC documents that the Renaissance institutional equities fund files over time, it changes every quarter because there are new people putting money in, there are people doing redemption. It’s a pretty good product, or at least the theory behind it is a pretty good product of a lower risk similar return thing to the S&P 500.\\n\\nDavid: And the marketing is built in. It’s not like there’s any lack of demand of outside capital that wants to invest with RenTech.\\n\\nBen: It’s really funny. There are always stories about how the marketing documents literally say this is not the Medallion fund. We don’t promise returns like the Medallion fund. In fact, we’re not charging for it like the Medallion fund.\\n\\nDavid, you said that the fees and carry on Medallion went up to what, 5% and 44%? Well on the institutional fund, the fees are 1% and 10%. You’re only taking 1% annual fee and 10% of the performance.\\n\\nDavid: Clearly, this is a very different product.\\n\\nBen: But people did not perceive that. People were very excited. It’s a Renaissance product, it’s the same analysts, they’re using all their fancy computers. I’m sure we’re going to get this crazy out performance. And at the end of the day, it is an extremely different vehicle.\\n\\nDavid: That has not performed anywhere near how Medallion has performed.\\n\\nBen: Correct. Has it served its purpose? Yeah. But is it Medallion? No. It’s not special in the way that Medallion is special.\\n\\nA couple of other funny things on the institutional fund. I spent a bunch of time scrolling through 13Fs over the last decade from the Medallion filings. They’re all from (I think) two institutional funds.\\n\\nDavid: There’s institutional equities and diversified alpha.\\n\\nBen: The funniest thing is they file these 13Fs. David and I are very used to looking at the 13Fs of friends of the show who run hedge funds, who we’ve had on as guests, or perhaps really just any investor where you want to see what are they buying and selling this quarter, and usually you see 15, 25, maybe 50 different names on there.\\n\\nThe 13Fs for Renaissance has 4300 stocks in these tiny little chunks. There’s a little bit of persistence, quarter-to-quarter. For example, weirdly Novo Nordisk has been one of their biggest holdings. Biggest, I say at 1%–2%. That’s their biggest position for several quarters in a row.\\n\\nDavid: Hey, they’ve been listening to Acquired.\\n\\nBen: That’s right.\\n\\nDavid: That’s one of the signals in the model.\\n\\nBen: You get the sense from looking at these filings that these things were flying all over the place, and this was just the moment in time where they decided to take a snapshot and put it on a piece of paper. Even though this is the end of quarter filing of what their ownership was, if you had taken it a day or a week earlier, it could look completely different.\\n\\nDavid: The way that some folks we talked to described the difference between the institutional funds and Medallion to us is that Medallion’s average hold time for their trades and positions is (call it) a day, maybe a day-and-a-half. Whereas the average hold time for the institutional funds positions is a couple of months.\\n\\nAcross 4300 stocks in the portfolio, there’s a lot of trading activity that happens on any given day, but it’s a lot slower in any given name than Medallion would be, which makes sense. Again, it gets back to this slippage concept. If you have a bigger fund and you’re investing larger amounts, which the institutional funds are, you can’t be trading as frequently or all of your gains are going to slip away.\\n\\nBen: And frankly, it just looks a lot like the S&P 500. When you look at as of November 2023, so 11 of the 12 months of the year had happened, they were up 8.6%. That sounds like an index type return. You look at the first 4 months of 2020, right after the crazy dip from the pandemic, they were down 10.4%. Less than the broader market, but they still were a mirror of the broader market.\\n\\nI think the RIEF, their institutional fund, yes it works as expected. No, it’s not Medallion. If it were standing on its own, there’s zero chance that we would be covering the organization behind it on Acquired.\\n\\nDavid: Zero percent chance. Speaking of the fund—that is the reason why we are covering this company on this show—we set up during the tech bubble crash, the volatility is when Medallion really shines. Well, there are no more volatile periods than 2007 and 2008. 2007 Medallion does 136% gross. 2008 Medallion does 152% gross. Get out of here. This is 2008 while the rest of the financial world is melting down.\\n\\nBen: This really does illustrate where do they make their money from? Who is on the other side of these trades? It’s people acting emotionally. They have effectively these really robust models that are highly unemotional, that are making these super intricate multi security bets. They’re putting on exactly the right set of trades to achieve the risk and exposure that the system wants them to have.\\n\\nWho is on the other side of those trades? It’s panic sellers, it’s dentists, it’s hedge funds who don’t trust their computer systems and are like, ah, crap, we got to just take risk off even though it’s a negative expected value move for us. They’re basically trading against human nature.\\n\\nImportantly, in this business versus every other business that we cover here on Acquired or most other businesses, this is truly zero sum. It’s not like they’re here in an industry that’s a growth industry and lots of competitors can take different approaches, but the whole pie is growing so much that I don’t care if no, you’re fighting over a fixed pie here. I’m trading against someone else. I win. They lose.\\n\\nDavid: There’s one slight nuance to that, but I don’t know how much it holds water. The apologist nuance would be, well, Warren Buffett could be on the other side of the trade, and Medallion could make money on that trade with Warren over its time horizon of a day-and-a-half. Warren could make money over his time horizon of 50 years.\\n\\nBen: Super fair.\\n\\nDavid: I think the argument against that, though, is that Medallions sold after a day-and-a-half to somebody else who bought at that lower price. Somewhere along the chain, that loss is getting offloaded to somebody. The direct counterparty of Medallion and the quant industry writ large might not take the loss, but somebody is going to take the loss along the way. It is, as you say, a zero sum game.\\n\\nBen: But I think the important thing is can you and your adversary both benefit, and I think in this case, you and your counterparty, the person you’re trading against, yes. You have two different objective outcomes. Can I get a penny over on Warren Buffet by managing to take him on this one trade? Sure. But his strategy is such that that is irrelevant.\\n\\nDavid: After the historic performance, during the financial crisis (as I alluded to earlier), Jim retires at the end of 2009, and Peter and Bob become co-CEOs, co-heads of the firm in 2010. They take the portfolio size up to $10 billion when they take over. It had been at $5 billion for the last few years of Jim’s tenure. They take it up to $10 billion, and really with no impact, which I assume means that RenTech was getting better and the models were getting better, because Otherwise they would’ve gone to $10 billion before.\\n\\nBen: They gained confidence that they had enough profitable trades they could make, that they could raise the capacity without dampening returns. And perhaps they could have done it earlier and they just didn’t have the confidence that it would work at larger size, but I bet they’re very good at knowing how large can our strategy work up to before it starts having diminishing returns.\\n\\nDavid: Importantly, during periods of peak volatility, say 2020, Medallion continues to shoot the lights out. From at least the data that we were able to find on Medallion’s performance over the past few years, 2020, they were up 149% gross and 76% net. The magic is still there.\\n\\nOne way to look at it, which may not be the be-all-and-end-all, but I think is a good way to compare Jim’s era at Medallion versus Peter and Bob’s era. During Jim’s tenure, Medallion’s total aggregate IRR from 1988 when the fund was formed to 2009 when he retired, was 63.5% gross annual returns and 40.1% net annual returns, which of course did include many periods of lower carry, 20% versus the 44%.\\n\\nDuring the post-Jim era, the Peter and Bob era from 2010 to 2022 was when we were able to get the latest data, IRRs are 77.3% gross and 40.3% net. Better on both fronts, even with much higher average fees. yeah, I think Medallion is doing fine.\\n\\nBen: It’s amazing. And we weren’t able to tell. There are some sources that report that they’ve grown from $10 billion in the last few years to being comfortable at a $15 billion fund size. If so, that just means that they continue to find more profitable strategies within Medallion to keep those same unbelievable returns at larger sizes.\\n\\nDavid: At the end of the day, this is all just insane. As far as we can tell—Ben, you alluded to this a bit at the beginning of the episode—and as far as anybody else can tell, Medallion has by far the best investing track record of any single investment vehicle in history.\\n\\nBen: So give me those net numbers.\\n\\nDavid: During the entire lifetime so far of Medallion from 1988 to 2022—that’s 34 years—the total net annual return number is 40%. Four-zero over 34 years after fees. It’s 68% before fees, which equates to total lifetime carry dollars for the whole firm of $60 billion just in carry by our calculations.\\n\\nBen: Astonishing.\\n\\nDavid: That is a lot of money.\\n\\nBen: Also, David Rosenthal, good spreadsheet work on this. You have not done a spreadsheet for an episode in a while, so I admire your work on this one.\\n\\nDavid: I still know how to use Excel. Barely. It’s going to be a dying art now with Copilot and GPTs.\\n\\nBen: That’s right. Okay, so $60 billion in total carry.\\n\\nDavid: $60 billion in total carry is a lot of money. Speaking of a lot of money, we do need to mention before we finish the story here, that RenTech money has bought a lot of influence in society.\\n\\nBob Mercer—that name may have sounded familiar to many of you along the way—was the primary funder of Breitbart and Cambridge Analytica, and one of the major financial backers of both the 2016 Trump campaign and the Brexit campaign in Great Britain.\\n\\nNow, lest you think that RenTech dollars are solely being funneled into one side of the political spectrum, Jim Simons is a major democratic donor, as are many other folks at RenTech.\\n\\nBen: Henry Laufer and other folks are also huge donors, approximately to the same tune as what Bob Mercer is on the right.\\n\\nDavid: Tens of millions of dollars, many tens of millions of dollars on all sides, and through many campaign cycles here from RenTech employees and alumni, This did become a flashpoint for the firm in the wake of the 2016 election. Mercer obviously became a controversial figure, both externally and internally within the firm.\\n\\nBen: Especially once people realized he was the through line through Breitbart, Cambridge Analytica, the Trump election, and Brexit.\\n\\nDavid: Ultimately, Jim asked Bob to step down as co-CEO in 2017, which he did, but he did remain a scientist at the firm and a contributor to the models, even though he wasn’t leading the organization with Peter from a leadership standpoint any longer.\\n\\nBen: Ultimately, the thing that surprised me the most is how these people all still work together, despite having about the most opposite political beliefs you could possibly have.\\n\\nDavid: Understatement of the century.\\n\\nBen: And all being extremely influential and active in those political systems. Yes, Bob Mercer is no longer the co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies. He still works there. He’s still associated. They all still speak highly of each other. It’s unexpected.\\n\\nDavid: I think unexpected is the best way to put it.\\n\\nBen: Like everything with Renaissance, it works a little bit different than the rest of the world.\\n\\nDavid: Speaking of, let’s transition to analysis. I have a fun little monologue I want to go on, if you will. Bear with me, Ben. I think this qualifies as the RenTech playbook, but I really think of it as the RenTech tapestry.\\n\\nI was inspired by Costco here because we were talking to folks in the research, and everybody said RenTech just has these puzzle pieces that fit together. On the surface. RenTech does the same things that Citadel, D. E. Shaw, Two Sigma, Jane Street, others, et cetera do. They hire the smartest people in the world, they give them the best data and infrastructure in the world to work on, and they say, go to town and make profitable trades.\\n\\nThose are very expensive commodities, those two things, the smartest people in the world and the best data and infrastructure, but they are commodities. Citadel can say the exact same things, just the same as Walmart and Amazon can say, we too have large scale supplier relationships that we leverage to provide low prices to customers just like Costco.\\n\\nBut it’s underneath that where I think the magic lies. There are three very interrelated things that make RenTech unique. Number one, they get the smartest people in the world to collaborate and not compete. Pretty much every other financial firm out there, employees and teams within the firm quasi compete with one another.\\n\\nBen: Typically in a friendly way, but yeah.\\n\\nDavid: Let’s take in a venture firm, you’ve got your lead partner on a deal, or a deal team. They’re working that deal. Maybe some of the other partners help a little bit, but mostly they’re off prosecuting their own deals. I think that’s the most collegial way that this happens in finance. Then you’ve got multi-strategy hedge funds out there where literally firms are being pitted against one another to be weighted in the ultimate trading model for the firm.\\n\\nAt RenTech, though, because of the one model architecture, everyone works together on the same investment strategy and the same investment infrastructure. That means everyone sees everybody else’s work. Everybody who works at RenTech on the research team, on the infrastructure team, have access to the whole model. That’s not true anywhere else.\\n\\nBen: That’s a good point. The whole code base is completely visible.\\n\\nDavid: And that also means because it’s just one model, just one strategy, when somebody else improves that model’s performance, that directly impacts you as much as it impacts them. This is really different from any other hedge fund out there.\\n\\nBen: Why is that different than if I roll some of my compensation into a multi-strategy hedge fund that I work at? Don’t I love other teams creating high performance also?\\n\\nDavid: Sure, but you don’t love it as much as your team because either compensation or career-wise, you are much more dependent on your performance than you are other people’s performance.\\n\\nBen: Oh yes. This is a big thing. You intend to have a job after that job at most places most of the time, so you care about credit, and you care about smashing the pinata and then going elsewhere, or building reputation and then going elsewhere. Most of the people at RenTech are not going to have another job.\\n\\nDavid: What did you find on LinkedIn, at least the median tenure of employees is like 16 years?\\n\\nBen: Yeah. I just got LinkedIn Premium and you can see median tenure. It’s crazy. There are only 300–400 employees at Renaissance, and the median tenure, at least as reported by LinkedIn, is 14 years.\\n\\nDavid: This brings me to point number two, which you said, this is an absurdly small team. There are less than 400 employees that work at RenTech, only half of which work in research and engineering, and the other half are either back office or institutional sales for the open funds. Let’s call it 150–200 people max who are hands-on the wheel here for Medallion.\\n\\nEvery other peer firm of RenTech, Citadel, D. E. Shaw, Two Sigma, et cetera, all of them—you lump Jane Street, jump the high frequency guys in here—minimum 2000–5000 people work at those places.\\n\\nBen: Wow. I didn’t realize it was that big.\\n\\nDavid: It is an order of magnitude more people who are working at the other firms versus who are working at RenTech.\\n\\nBen: Unless you think that it’s a capital-based thing, no. The institutional funds have gotten big. They peaked at over $100 billion, but they’re currently between $60 and $70 billion that they manage on top of the $10 or $15 billion that’s in the Medallion fund.\\n\\nDavid: AUM is the same as these big funds. This has all sorts of benefits. Number one, there’s the Hermès Atelier workshop benefit. Everyone knows each other by name. You know your colleagues’ kids, you know your colleagues’ families.\\n\\nBen: They put right on their website. There are 90 PhDs in mathematics, physics, computer science, and related fields. The about page has these 10 random bullet points and that’s one of them.\\n\\nDavid: Then there’s the related aspect to all this. The firm is in the middle of nowhere on Long Island. You actually know your colleagues, families, and kids because you’re not going out and getting drinks with someone from Two Sigma in New York City. You’re not comparing notes or measuring parts of your anatomy with someone else. You’re hanging out at the swimming pool.\\n\\nBen: Totally. Since Renaissance doesn’t recruit from finance jobs, it’s unlikely that you know someone else in finance. You came out of a science-related field. You now work in East Setauket, Long Island, which has 10,000 people or something or less that live there. You’re in this little town, you’re not actually going into the city that often, and if you are, it’s (again) not to grab drinks with other finance people. Even if you didn’t have a many-page non-compete and a lifetime NDA, you’re very unlikely to be in the social circles.\\n\\nDavid: You’re Just not getting exposed.\\n\\nBen: Exactly.\\n\\nDavid: And RenTech’s hiring established scientists and PhDs. They’re not hiring kids out of undergrad like Jane Street or Bridgewater is. My sense is that the place is like a college campus without any students.\\n\\nBen: Have you seen the pictures online?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah.\\n\\nBen: If you look up Renaissance Technologies at Google and you go and look at the photos on campus, it’s little courtyard, winding walking path, and woods all around it, tennis courts.\\n\\nDavid: Then there’s the last piece of the small team element, which is just the magnitude of the financial impact, which I don’t think is true. But let’s say that there were another quant fund that made the same number of dollars of performance returns that RenTech does. At RenTech you’re splitting that a couple of hundred ways. At Citadel you’re splitting that 5000 ways. It just doesn’t make sense to go anywhere else.\\n\\nBen: We were chatting with someone to prep for this episode, and they told us you can’t ever compete with them, but they’ll pay you enough that you won’t want to.\\n\\nDavid: This brings me to what I’ve been teasing that I’m super excited about. I think the third puzzle piece of what makes RenTech so unique and defensible is Medallion’s structure itself, that it is an LP-GP fund with 5% management fee and 44% carry.\\n\\nBen: It’s not like a prop shop or proprietary just one pot of money. It’s literally a GP-LP, even though the GPs and the LPs are the same people.\\n\\nDavid: Here’s my thinking on this. Now, I don’t know how it is actually structured, but there was something about this whole crazy 44% carry that just wasn’t sitting with me right throughout the research, because I kept asking myself why.\\n\\nBen: They’ve already kicked out most of the LPs, if not all, so why are they raising the carry?\\n\\nDavid: It’s all themselves, it’s all insiders. Why do they charge themselves 44% carry and 5% management fees? I think Jim talks about this that, oh, I pay the fees just like everybody else.\\n\\nBen: It’s always a funny argument. Who are you paying the fees to?\\n\\nDavid: What is happening here? Okay, here’s my hypothesis. This is not about having crazy performance fees. This is not about having the highest carry in the industry. This is a value transfer mechanism within the firm, from the tenure base to the current people who are working on Medallion in any given year.\\n\\nHere’s how I think it works. When people come into RenTech, they obviously have way less wealth than the people who’ve been there for a long time, both from the direct returns that you’re getting every year from working there and just your investment percentage of the Medallion fund, which by the way, I think they took, it was either the state of New York or the federal government to court to be able to have the 401(k) plan at RenTech be the Medallion fund.\\n\\nBen: No way.\\n\\nDavid: If you work there, your 401(k) is the Medallion fund.\\n\\nBen: That’s crazy. It really doesn’t take more than a few years before you’re set for life.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Depending on your definition of set for life, I think it happens very, very quickly. Given that, though, how do you avoid the incentive for a group of talented younger folks to split off and go start their own Medallion fund?\\n\\nBen: Especially when they all have access to the whole code base. The whole thing is meant to function like a university math department, where everyone’s constantly knowledge-sharing because we’re going to create better peer-reviewed research when we all share all the knowledge all the time. You would think that’s a super risky thing to give everyone all the keys.\\n\\nDavid: I think it’s the 44% carry structure that does it. Basically what you’re saying is every year 5% management fee, so 5% off the top and then 44% of performance.\\n\\nLet’s say Medallion is on the order of (call it) doubling every year. Let’s round that up and just add them and say 49% of the economic returns in any given year go to the current team, and 51% of the economic returns go to the tenure base.\\n\\nWhat is the equivalent here? I think it’s like academic tenure kind of thing. The longer tenure you are at the firm, the more your balance shifts to the LP side of things. The younger you are at the firm, the more your balance is on the GP side of things. But at the end of the day, it’s 51-49.\\n\\nThere’s this very natural value transfer mechanism to keep the people that are working in any given year super incentivized. As you stay there longer, you are paying your younger colleagues to work for you.\\n\\nBen: It’s funny, I think it’s a good insight that it’s structured like a university department tenure.\\n\\nDavid: Well, I just kept asking myself, why? Why? Why do they have this if there are no outside LPs? And this was the best thing I could come up with. I actually think it’s genius.\\n\\nBen: It’s more elegant than it’s all one person’s money and they’re deciding to bonus out the current team every year and just give them enough money to make sure you retain them.\\n\\nDavid: Which is how I think most prop shops work. Like Jane Street is mostly a prop shop. I think it is mostly the principal’s money, but that’s a static situation. It’s not like if that were true then Jim would just own this thing forever. I don’t think that’s true here at RenTech.\\n\\nBen: Essentially David, the real magic is they’ve got one fund, it’s evergreen, and when you start at the firm, you’re only getting paid the carry amount, but over time you become a meaningful investor in the firm and you shift to that 51%. You’re the LP, and then over time you eventually graduate out entirely and you’re only an LP.\\n\\nYou’re right, it’s a value transfer mechanism from the old guard to the new guard in a way that is clear, well understood, probably tax-advantaged, versus just doing, I’m the owner and I’m giving everyone arbitrary bonuses.\\n\\nDavid: And at the end of the day, I think these three pieces to me are the core of this tapestry of RenTech. One model that everybody collaborates on together. A super small team where we all know each other, and the financial impact that any of us make to that one model is great to all of us.\\n\\nThree, this LP-GP model with very high carry performance fees, that creates the right set of incentives both for new talent on the way in and old talent on the way out.\\n\\nBen: I think that’s right. There are a few other parts of the story that we skipped along the way because there was no real good place to put them in. But these are objectively fascinating historical events that are totally worth knowing about.\\n\\nThe first one is called basket options. The year is 2002. RenTech has 13 years of knowing that they basically have a machine that prints money. What should you do when you have a machine that prints money? Leverage.\\n\\nNow, there are all sorts of restrictions around firms like this and how much leverage they can take on. You can’t just go and say, I’m going to borrow $100 for every dollar of equity capital that I have in here. You need to get clever to borrow a whole bunch of money from banks or from any lender to basically juicier returns if again, you have a money printing machine that’s reliable. Most people don’t. Most people probably shouldn’t take leverage because they’re just as likely to blow the whole thing up as they are to be successful. So basket options.\\n\\nI am going to read directly from the man who solved the market because Greg Zuckerman just put it perfectly. “Basket options are financial instruments whose values are pegged to their performance of a specific basket of stocks. While most options are based on an individual stock or a financial instrument, basket options are linked to a group of shares. If these underlying stocks rise, the value of the option goes up.\\n\\nIt’s like owning the shares without actually doing so. Indeed, the banks who of course loaned the money, who put the money in the basket option were legal owners of the shares in the basket. But for all intents and purposes, they were Medallion’s property.”\\n\\nThis is very clever Medallion saying, well, the way we’re going to lever up is there’s a basket. We have an option to purchase that basket. Most of the capital in that basket is actually the bank’s capital, but the bank has hired us to trade the options in the basket. Then after a year when long-term capital gains tax kicks in, we have the option to buy that basket.\\n\\nAnyway, all day Medallion’s computers send automated instructions to the banks. Sometimes in the order of a minute or even a second. The options gave Medallion the ability to borrow significantly more than it otherwise would be allowed to.\\n\\nCompetitors generally had about $7 of financial instruments for every dollar of cash. By contrast, Medallion’s option strategy allowed it to have $12.50 worth of financial instruments for every dollar of cash, making it easier to trounce rivals, assuming they could keep finding profitable trades. When Medallion finds an especially juicy opportunity, it could boost leverage holding close to $20 of asset for every dollar of cash. In 2002, Medallion managed over $5 billion, but it controlled over $60 billion of investment positions.\\n\\nDavid, this exposes something we haven’t shared yet on the episode, which is it’s not just that they could find $5 billion worth of profitable trades. It’s that they wanted to lever the crap out of $5 billion and find $60 billion of profitable trades to make. Basket options gave them a legal way to have an incredible amount of leverage in a way that they felt safe about.\\n\\nDavid: The unlevered returns, if you were running this strategy would be much lower.\\n\\nBen: A big piece of this playbook that we didn’t talk about is leverage, but every quant fund does leverage. Renaissance was just more clever than everyone else.\\n\\nDavid: It’s an important point, though. Nine out of every ten companies that we cover on Acquired leverage is zero part of the story. For us, coming from the world we come from in tech and venture capital, leverage is a dirty word, like I’m scared of it.\\n\\nBen: You could imagine, let’s say it wasn’t they were right 50.25% of the time, but they were right 50.0001% of the time. They would need to do a ton of trades in order to generate enough profits. That’s why you need $60 billion of cash to actually execute the strategy to produce the returns that they were looking for on $5 billion of equity.\\n\\nAnyway, there’s a second chapter to this. It’s all well and good that this is how they get a bunch of leverage. That’s one piece of it. The other piece is they thought this was a remarkably tax-efficient vehicle. The way that they were filing their taxes said, oh sure there’s stuff in that basket, but the thing that we actually own is an option to buy that basket or sell that basket. We only exercise that once every 13 months or so.\\n\\nI don’t know the exact number, but something like that over a year. Therefore, we’re buying something, we’re holding it for a year, we’re selling it. Oh, of course there are millions and millions of trades going on inside the basket, but we don’t own that basket. The banks do. We’re just advising them. You can see the logic here.\\n\\nOver time, eventually in 2021, the IRS said, no. You made all those trades. That was not a completely separate entity. You guys owed $6.8 billion in taxes that you didn’t pay. You’re going to need to pay that with interest, with penalties, and by the way, Jim Simons, we’re going to want you and the other few partners to really bear the load of that. And they did. For Simons alone, he paid $670 million to the IRS in back taxes for this basket option strategy that turned out not to be a long-term capital gain.\\n\\nAll right. Numbers on the business today and then we will dive into power and playbook. Today, we’ve talked about Medallion, $10 or $15 billion depending on who you ask. Historically it was more like $5 or $10 billion. The institutional fund is about $60 to $70 billion, and at one point was $100 billion. The total carry generated, David, you said is $60 billion.\\n\\nForbes estimates that Jim Simons alone is worth about $30 billion today, which pencils with a bunch of other stats over the years that he owned about half of Renaissance. The returns, obviously the Medallion fund generated approximately 66% annualized from 1988 to 2020. After those fees, was about 39%. Wild.\\n\\nAn interesting thing to understand, I ran a hypothetical scenario, of how much money do you think Renaissance the business makes a year in revenue. The institutional fund, let’s call it 10% on $60 billion of assets. That’s $600 million from fees and $600 million from performance, so $1.2 billion a year in revenue to the firm from the institutional side of the business.\\n\\nI always ask myself the question, does that actually matter? They did all this work to stand up the institutional side. Who cares? Well, let’s say Medallion does their average 66% gross on $15 billion. That is $750 million in fees and $4.3 billion on performance. So a total of $5 billion from Medallion and $1.2 billion from the institutional side of the business.\\n\\nNow of course the employees are the investors in Medallion, so you could just argue it’s actually silly to cut them up, but I don’t know. It’s a $7, $8, $9 billion revenue business.\\n\\nDavid: That’s not including the LP return on Medallion.\\n\\nBen: A hundred percent. It’s not.\\n\\nDavid: Which again, as we spent a long time talking about, it’s all the same thing.\\n\\nBen: But it’s interesting just to compare it against other companies to have this in the back of your head. This is a $7–$8 billion a year revenue business.\\n\\nDavid: Now, I think there are a lot of expenses on the infrastructure side.\\n\\nBen: Totally. That was another thing I wanted to talk about. The fact that they do, let’s say Medallion alone, have $750 million in fees. I don’t think they come close to $750 million a year in expenses, but they are running, who knows what infrastructure, some kind of super computing cluster. What does it cost to run one Amazon data center? It’s (I think) much smaller scale?\\n\\nDavid: I don’t know. You’re talking about a lot of data here.\\n\\nBen: It says right on their website they have 50,000 computer cores with 150 gigabits per second of global connectivity, and a research database that grows by more than 40 terabytes a day. That’s a lot of data.\\n\\nDavid: Is that $750 million a year? I don’t know, but it’s not zero.\\n\\nBen: I don’t think so. They’re certainly not losing money on the fees, but there are actual hard costs to this business.\\n\\nDavid: I wonder, too, if the fee element of Medallion basically pays the base salaries for the current team.\\n\\nBen: That feels like it’s right. If you’re someone who has done a data center build out before or has any way to back into what the costs of Medallion’s operating expenses are on the compute, data, and network side, we would love to hear from you, hello@acquired.fm. Okay, power.\\n\\nDavid: Power. This is a fun one.\\n\\nBen: Listeners who are new to the show, this is Hamilton Helmer’s framework from the book Seven Powers. What is it that enables a business to achieve persistent differential returns to be more profitable than their closest competitor on a sustainable basis? The seven are counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs, network economies, process power, branding, and cornered resource.\\n\\nDavid, my question to you to open this section is specifically about RenTech’s lifelong non-competes. That feels like a big reason that they maintain their competitive advantage. I’m curious if you agree with that, what would you put that under?\\n\\nDavid: I think it’s lifelong NDAs and non-competes as long as the state of New York legally allows for, but that it’s not lifetime. I’ve heard various figures, six years, five years, something like that. At the end of the day, non-competes are more like what is one side willing to go to court over? But the reality is people don’t leave. People don’t leave, period, and people especially don’t leave and start their own firms.\\n\\nI was thinking about this in the middle of the night, and I think there are three layers to the effective non-compete that happens with RenTech. There’s the legal layer, the base layer that you’re talking about—it’s like the agreements you sign—then there’s the economic layer of what we spent a long time talking about in tapestry of it would just be dumb to leave.\\n\\nYou’re better off staying there as part of that team with a smaller number of people than going to Sigma with a lot more people. I think that’s the next level up. And then I think the highest level is just probably the social layer. You’re there with the smartest people in the world in a collegial atmosphere where you’re all working hard on something that has direct impact on you.\\n\\nBen: It’s your community.\\n\\nDavid: It’s your community, totally. You’re not in New York City, you’re not in the Hamptons, you’re not in Silicon Valley. You are selecting into that. I think if that’s what you want, then what better place in the world.\\n\\nBen: All right, classify it. What power does that fall under?\\n\\nDavid: I think the people specifically you would put into cornered resource, but I’m not actually sure that fully captures it here. I was thinking more process power, because I think it is the combination of the people and the model and the incentive structures.\\n\\nBen: I think that’s right. I also had my biggest one being process power. You actually can develop intricate knowledge of how a system works, and then build processes around that that are hard to replicate elsewhere. I think these systems have been layered over time also, where anyone who’s come into the firm in the last five years doesn’t know how it works start to finish.\\n\\nI didn’t ask anyone to verify that, but it’s over 10 million lines of code and the level of complexity of the system of when it’s putting on trades, what trades it’s putting on, why, the speed at which they need to happen, I actually don’t think anyone holds the whole model in their head. I think there’s process power just because it’s 30+ years of complexity that’s been built up.\\n\\nDavid: I totally agree with that, particularly in the model itself. Maybe you could argue the model is a cornered resource.\\n\\nBen: I am going to argue that the data is a cornered resource. I don’t know for sure about the model. Maybe? I guess that’s the same thing as saying the knowledge of what the 10 million lines of code does, that’s the model.\\n\\nBut I actually think the fact that they have clean data and they’ve been creating systems. They have the best PhDs in the world thinking about data cleaning. That’s not a sexy job, and yet they have probably the treasure trove of historical market data in the best format that nobody else has. That’s an actual cornered resource.\\n\\nDavid: I have a couple of nuances on this. One, I think it probably is true that they have better data than any other firm thanks to Sandor Straus and the work that he started doing in the 80s before anybody else was really doing this. They have that and other firms don’t. That said, certainly all the other quant firms are throwing untold resources at all this, too.\\n\\nBen: They want to do this, and money’s not the issue.\\n\\nDavid: In chatting with a few folks about this episode, I had more than one person say to me, there are two ways that RenTech could work. One version of how it works is they discovered something 20+ years ago that is a timeless secret, and they’ve been trading on that for 20+ years.\\n\\nBen: There’s one particular relationship between types of equities that they’ve just been exploiting, and no one can figure out except them.\\n\\nDavid: And that may entirely be possible.\\n\\nBen: Isn’t that crazy?\\n\\nDavid: Right. Now, RenTech will all say that is 100% not the way that it works. It’s not that at all. If that were the way that it works, they would of course still say that because they don’t want anybody to know.\\n\\nBen: Don’t look at the relationship between soybean futures and GM. Just don’t do it.\\n\\nDavid: Let’s accept that there is a possibility that that might be true. More likely though, is that what RenTech does say is true, which is no, there is no holy grail. What we do here is we completely reinvent the whole system continuously on a two year cycle. Two years is what I heard. That the model is fully restructured every two years. It’s not like on a date every two years, it’s being restructured every day. But collectively it’s about a two-year cycle.\\n\\nBen: That would be an argument then that the people actually could—five people left—go recreate it and all they would need is the data.\\n\\nDavid: It’s also an argument that there is no actual cornered resource here in terms of either the model itself and maybe not the data either.\\n\\nBen: I bet that data is, though. Let’s say you’ve been working there for 10 years. You don’t know how the 1955 soybean futures data ended up in the database. Even if you’re used to using that data and you’re able to go recreate the model elsewhere, you don’t know how it originally found its way in.\\n\\nDavid: I think that’s fair. I think there might also be some argument to the data that that older data is helpful, but its value decays over time as markets evolve.\\n\\nBen: Definitely.\\n\\nDavid: The broader point I want to make here is just that every other major quant farm out there is also spending hundreds of millions, if not billions on this stuff too.\\n\\nBen: And people are looking for alt data everywhere. The bridgewaters of the world are paying gobs of money for things that you would never dream could possibly have an effect on the stock market, yet they’re paying billions or tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars for it.\\n\\nDavid: I think we can rule out scale economies for sure. If anything, there are anti scale economies here.\\n\\nBen: Oh yes. There’s totally economies of scale. Your strategy stop working when you get too much AUM.\\n\\nDavid: You get slippage. I don’t think there are any network economies here. They literally don’t talk to anybody.\\n\\nBen: Although, well, they do have some very well-established relationships with electronic brokerages and different players in the trade execution chain. I think they have very good trade execution and very fast market data. Their ability to pull data out of the market is very high quality.\\n\\nDavid: Do you think it’s actually better than their competitors, though?\\n\\nBen: I don’t know. That’s probably not the secret sauce.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I don’t think so.\\n\\nBen: It’s the table stakes.\\n\\nDavid: Switching costs I don’t think apply, branding maybe applies in their ability to raise money for the institutional funds, but that’s not a big part of the business.\\n\\nBen: The fee stream on the institutional fund may entirely belong to branding. But I think there are a lot of public equity firms and a lot of hedge funds that have a lot of branding power that have on average market returns with decent Sharpe ratios and are able to raise because they’ve built a brand. Venture firms are the same way.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. For me, this leaves counter-positioning, I actually think there’s some counter-positioning here. I think we’re going to have two episodes in a row of counter-positioning at scale.\\n\\nBen: Tell me about your counter-positioning. Who is being counter-positioned in what way?\\n\\nDavid: There are direct competitors in the market, the other quant firms. When I say direct competitors, I obviously don’t mean for LP dollars. I mean for the same type of trading activity.\\n\\nBen: Like they are counterparties in trades.\\n\\nDavid: I don’t think they are counterparties. I think they are all seeking to exploit similar types of trades. I think the counterparties are the people there, the dentists that they’re taking advantage of.\\n\\nBen: Well, but quant funds are often counterparties to each other.\\n\\nDavid: That’s true. But I think yes, adversaries in finding the similar types of trades. I think the counter-positioning for RenTech or for Medallion, specifically, is I do think the single model approach versus the multi-model, multi-strategy approach that most others have, does have benefits like I was talking about in the tapestries.\\n\\nBut I think also and maybe bigger is every incentive at RenTech is fully aligned to optimize fund size for performance in a way that is not true just about everywhere else. I think they have the most incentive of anybody to truly maximize performance we’re able to achieve.\\n\\nBen: Even though the dollars would continue to rise because they get fee dollars from more money in the door. They are incentivized in a unique way that makes it so they’re not willing to trade the dampener on performance to get those dollars.\\n\\nDavid: Particularly because it’s all the same people on the GP and LP side.\\n\\nBen: Oh, we keep going round and round that axle. I loosely buy the counter positioning thing. I just think the answer is disgustingly simple and annoying here, which is they’re just better than everyone else at this particular type of math and machine learning, and they’ve been doing it for longer, so they’re just going to keep beating you.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, that’s another argument I heard from people, in that RenTech basically is a math department in a way that none of these other firms are.\\n\\nBen: It could be culture.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, it could be culture.\\n\\nBen: I mean, honest to God it could just be that the culture is set up in a way that continues to attract the right people and incentivize them in a fake altruistic way. Like this is just a fun place to do my work, and yeah the outcome is getting really rich, but I wouldn’t go work at Citadel.\\n\\nDavid: I think that could be, so maybe that feeds into process power. Okay, for me it is some combination of process power and counter positioning. I don’t think it’s any of the other powers.\\n\\nBen: For me it is process power and cornered resource.\\n\\nDavid: I buy that.\\n\\nBen: A thing that’s not captured in seven powers is tactical, execution. The whole point of seven powers is that strategy is different from tactics. I think legitimately RenTech may just have persistently been able to out-execute their competitors. There’s part of it that’s just like they’re smarter than you.\\n\\nDavid: Well if you buy the whole thing gets reinvented continuously every two years, then yes.\\n\\nBen: And there’s remnant knowledge. If you started building a machine learning system in 1964, you’re going to be really good at machine learning today. The people that you’ve been spending time with for the last 15 years, learning all of your historical knowledge and working in your systems are also going to be better at machine learning than probably the other people who are out in the world learning it from people that just got inspired to start learning machine learning based on the new hotness. Learnings compound is my answer.\\n\\nOkay, playbook. In addition to the three-part David Rosenthal tapestry that you have woven…\\n\\nDavid: I have nothing more to add.\\n\\nBen: …there are a handful of things that I think are worth hitting. The first one is signal processing, is signal processing, is signal processing. By not caring about the underlying assets, they literally don’t trade on fundamentals, except in the institutional fund when they trade on fundamentals a little bit. They use price earnings ratios and stuff like that in the institutional fund, which is funny because that’s a completely different skillset.\\n\\nBut if you just look at Medallion, it’s all just abstract numbers. You don’t actually have to care about what underlies those numbers. You just have to look for whether it’s linear regression or any of the fancier stuff that they do, just relationships between data. Once you reduce it to that, it is so brilliant that they can just recruit from any field.\\n\\nIt’s not relevant how someone has done sophisticated signal processing in the past, whether it’s being an astronomer and trying to denoise a “photo” of a star super far away, or whether they’ve tried to do natural language processing. It’s just signal.\\n\\nDavid: There’s this really funny line that Jim, Peter, and others will say when asked about why they only hire academics and not from Wall Street and whatnot. They’re like, well we found it’s easier to teach smart people the investing business then teach investing people…\\n\\nBen: How to be smart.\\n\\nDavid: Right. That’s ridiculous. They don’t teach anybody anything about investing. They’re just doing signal processing. I bet at least half the people at RenTech on the research side could not read a balance sheet.\\n\\nBen: It’s so funny. It’s a whole bunch of people who are in the investment business, none of which are investors.\\n\\nAnother one that you can decide if this fits or not. I was thinking a lot about complex adaptive systems. It’s always been on my mind since we had the NZS capital guys on a few years ago and read their work and the Santa Fe Institute’s work on this.\\n\\nIn a complex adaptive system, it’s really difficult to actually understand how one thing affects everything else because the idea is the relationships are so combinatorially complex that you can’t deterministically nail down this one thing as the cause of that other thing. It’s the butterfly flapping its wings.\\n\\nBut there are relationships between entities that you can’t understand or see on the surface. Do you remember way back when we did our second NVIDIA episode? I opened with the idea that when I was a kid, I always used to look at fire and think if you actually knew the composition of the atoms in the wood, and you actually knew the way the wind was blowing, and you actually knew that… all the, could you actually model the fire?\\n\\nWhen I was a kid and you always just assume no, but actually the answer is yes. This is a known thing of what will happen when you light this log on fire for the next three hours, and can you see exactly the flames.\\n\\nI think RenTech has basically, they haven’t figured that out for the market. They can’t predict the future. But if they have a 50.01% chance of being correct, then they can take a complex adaptive system and say we don’t really care that it’s a complex adaptive system. Our models understand enough about the relationships between all these entities that we’re just going to run the simulation a bunch of times, and we’re going to be profitable enough from all the little pennies that we’re collecting on all the little coin flips where we have a slight edge over and over and over and over again, that they’re the closest in the world to being able to actually predict how the complex adaptive system of the market will work.\\n\\nNow, I don’t think they can back out to it. No person could explain it, but I think their computers can.\\n\\nDavid: I think when I’ve heard people from RenTech talk about this, they will all say the model does not actually understand the market, but it can predict and we can be so confident in its predictions about what the market will do, that we rely on it. Whether it understands or doesn’t understand, doesn’t actually matter. It can’t tell you why, but that’s okay.\\n\\nBen: But it does know it has a slight edge, so it should trade on it even though it can’t explain why.\\n\\nWell, speaking of models, I’ve been trying to nail down an answer to this question. Do you think RenTech was the birthplace of machine learning?\\n\\nDavid: This is such a tough answer to tell. We actually emailed some friends who are very prominent AI researchers and AI historians and asked this question. The answer we got back is unsurprising. They said, we don’t know because they don’t share anything.\\n\\nBen: It’s like the principles certainly came out of the same math community that spawned machine learning. But is what RenTech has figured out over the last couple of decades in Google’s Gemini model and in ChatGPT…? No it’s not, because they don’t contribute any research back.\\n\\nIt may be the case that actually RenTech has beat everyone else to the punch, and they have a strong AI or something that is actually much more sophisticated than all the AI we have out in the world today, and they’ve just chosen that they’d rather keep it locked up, captive, and make a bunch of money.\\n\\nIt could just be the case that Renaissance is just taking in as much unstructured data as it possibly can, and they were just a decade or two ahead of everyone else in realizing that you can have unstructured, unlabeled data, and if you have enough of it, you can make it, in the case of an LLM, say things that sound right or sound true. Or in the case of these trades, be right more than 50% of the time.\\n\\nDavid: Make trades that sound right.\\n\\nBen: They figured out this big, unsupervised learning thing before anybody else, all the way up until last year when the AI moment happened.\\n\\nDavid: If that were the case, we should have very different answer to powers.\\n\\nBen: To illustrate this point. It’s quite interesting. Peter Brown’s academic advisor was Jeffrey Hinton.\\n\\nDavid: I’m so glad we brought this up. Yeah, it was the exact same stew, the exact same cohort of people, social group, and academic groups that RenTech came out of, that AI came out of.\\n\\nBen: Just for people who are like, why are you saying that? To make it super explicit, the other person whose academic advisor was Jeffrey Hinton is Ilya Sutskever, who is the co-founder of OpenAI. Many years later, but still.\\n\\nDavid: It’s like we were talking about with Markov models and hidden Markov models. That is the foundation of RenTech. That is one of the foundations of AI and generative AI today.\\n\\nBen: Another big one is this concept that you should trade on a secret that others are not trading on. On the face of it, it seems obvious. Of course I should come up with some strategy to trade on that other people aren’t trading on. But I said a couple of words there, which is ‘of course I should come up with.’ Therein lies the fallacy.\\n\\nI think most investment firms try to get their ideas out of people, and then do an incredibly rigorous amount of data analysis to figure out if they should put those trades on or not. I could be wrong, but I do not think modern RenTech does that. I think all of their investment ideas come from data and come from signal processing. Therefore you are going to put trades on that make no intuitive sense.\\n\\nWhen you’re putting trades on that are profitable and make no intuitive sense, you aren’t going to have competitors. If you find a relationship between two things that a human could never come up with or dream of those relationships—and we’re saying too it end things, 10 things, 20 things, 100 things and in various different weights at various different timescales—that is a killer recipe to exploit a secret that no one else knows and be able to beat other people in the market.\\n\\nDavid: Such a good point. Many, if not most, of the other quant firms are not doing that. Some of them maybe, but I think most of them are the model is suggesting things, and there is a person or persons who are the master portfolio allocators that pull the trigger or don’t pull the trigger.\\n\\nBen: To be super illustrative because I think your natural tendency is like, oh I can understand why these two things would be related, the relationship may not be what you figure.\\n\\nFor example, there could be two things that always move together. Tesla stock and wheat futures. You might try to, because humans are storytellers, concoct some story in your head of why those move together, and if you believe it then you might decide there’s some date where they should stop moving together.\\n\\nWell it could very well be that some other big hedge fund just owns both of those things, and when they rebalance it causes those assets to move together. But you would never think of that. You would think these things have a direct relationship with each other, not just that there’s liquidity in the market from both of them at the same time because someone else owns both of them. I think what RenTech admitted is we have no idea why anything is actually connected, but it doesn’t matter.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. That was surprising for me in the research. I assumed that was the whole quant industry and it was very surprising to me to discover that I believe. No, it is pretty much only RenTech and maybe a couple of other people.\\n\\nBen: My next one is brought to you by a friend of the show, Brett Harrison, who has worked in the quant trading industry for a long time, and shared an idea that he has with us, which is that there’s basically this two-by-two matrix. You have on the one axis fast and slow in terms of trade execution, and on the Y-axis you have smart versus obvious.\\n\\nDavid: The way he phrased it to us was smart versus dumb, but dumb doesn’t mean dumb.\\n\\nBen: It’s the obvious trades. The high level point is all quant funds are not high frequency trading firms and vice versa. This is something that I didn’t know not coming from this industry and now makes total sense to me. I think I thought they were the same thing.\\n\\nFast and obvious is your classic high frequency trader. They’re front-running trades, they’re locating in a data center that’s really near the, this is Flash Boys, or they’ve got a microwave line between New Jersey and Chicago, and they’re trying to arb the difference between two markets. You need to have the fastest connectivity in the world to pull this off.\\n\\nDavid: This is Jane Street.\\n\\nBen: Yes. There’s fast and smart, which you don’t need to be both. You don’t need the fastest connectivity in the world and the most clever trades to put on. People tend to pick a lane that they’re either a high frequency trader or they’re trying to make the smartest, most non-obvious trades possible.\\n\\nThat of course leads us to Medallion, which is in the slow and smart quadrant. All the machine learning system discovered the relationships in the data, so there’s a huge amount of compute…\\n\\nDavid: The non-obvious trades.\\n\\nBen: Exactly, that goes into finding the non-obvious trades, but then they’re actually made reasonably slowly. They still have to happen within seconds or minutes, but the advantage isn’t that they’re high frequency the way that all the Flash Boys stuff is.\\n\\nDavid: My sense is RenTech is not a high frequency trading shop. They’re not front running things, they’re not Flash Boys. Compared to you and me, they still operate incredibly fast. But it’s more about the smartness and less about the fastness.\\n\\nBen: Greg has a quote in his book. “They hold thousands of long and short positions at any given time, and they’re holding period ranges from one to two days or one to two weeks. They make between 150,000 and 300,000 trades a day, but much of that activity entailed buying or selling in small chunks to avoid impacting market prices, rather than profiting by stepping in front of other investors.”\\n\\nDavid: This is another thing that we heard. RenTech is world class at disguising their trades.\\n\\nBen: They can make it so that they don’t move the market and you don’t know who is acting or when. This is because in the early days they weren’t good at this and people basically intercepted the trades that they were making and were front running them. They had to adapt and develop these clever systems to make it so you don’t know who’s buying, you don’t know in what quantities, and you don’t know if they’re going to keep buying.\\n\\nMy last one before we get into value creation, value capture is that this is a terrifying business to be in. The amount of controls and risk models that you need and kill switches are just so important. What if the software has a bug? Is it possible to make a ton of unprofitable trades in a matter of minutes and lose it all? That wasn’t possible in the old world where you’re calling your broker. That totally is possible here.\\n\\nDavid: And it happened.\\n\\nBen: While it’s never happened to RenTech, there was a company called Night Capital in 2012 that lost $460 million in a single day. There was a bug in their process to deploy the new code.\\n\\nBasically, what happened was a simple flag error, a misinterpretation of setting a bit from zero to one that caused this infinite loop to run. Once a certain trade happened, it was supposed to flip the bit. It flipped a different bit. The systems were not looking at the same location and memory for the same bit. It basically thought it was never flipped.\\n\\nThis infinite loop ran 4 million trade executions in 45 minutes. There wasn’t the appropriate kill switches built in. They basically watched it all to just drain out, and there was nothing they could do.\\n\\nDavid: The whole portfolio gone, right?\\n\\nBen: Yes. Well, I don’t know if it’s the whole portfolio, but it was enough that they lost a huge amount of LP capital. They were a publicly-traded firm. Overnight, their equity traded down 75%, and then someone stepped in and bought them.\\n\\nDavid: They probably got margin-called by all their counterparties.\\n\\nBen: Whoever is in charge of the financial controls and safety systems at RenTech, that’s a huge job for someone in this industry.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: To kick off value creation, value capture, I have a provocative statement. David, Renaissance Technologies is actually not in the investment business. They are in the gambling business. In particular, they’re the house.\\n\\nDavid: Well I thought where you thought you were going with this, I was like, yes, I would totally agree. They’re not in the investment business. They have no idea how to invest. The model does.\\n\\nBen: I’ll say you this. They’re not investors and they’re not in the investment business. There is investment going on all around them in the markets that they trade in. But the fact that they’re in those markets, they’re not there as investors. They’re there setting up shop as Caesar’s Palace, letting everyone come in and do business with them while they have a slight edge. They’ll lose sometimes, but most of the time they’re going to come out slightly ahead.\\n\\nLet’s say they do have a 50.01% chance of being right. They’re just there to collect their vig on everyone who is willing to trade with them over all these years. At scale it really worked. Jim Simons managed to drain $30 billion into his own pocket out of everybody that he ever traded with.\\n\\nDavid: Now, I think where you’re going with this is perhaps similarly along the lines to Caesar’s Palace or a casino. They are not in the investment business but they’re providing a service. Is this where you’re going with this?\\n\\nBen: Well, the investment business, it depends how you define investor. If you want to be all hoity-toity about it—which in this illustrative example I’m being one—and saying an investor is someone who provides risk capital to a business, for that business to create value in some way in the future. Or you lend money to some intrinsic underlying asset so that it can be productive with that capital and produce a return for you as an investor.\\n\\nOf course, lots of things are called investing that are not that. Is it investment if I put money to work, then I get more money back later, I don’t actually care how the money got made, and it’s actually zero sum, I’m just vacuuming it out of…?\\n\\nDavid: Right, right. The money is not being invested in anything to produce.\\n\\nBen: Correct. But it’s literally the same business model as a casino. You have a slight edge, and you let a whole bunch of patrons come in and lose money to you in your slight edge.\\n\\nDavid: Where I was going with the service provider, I think casinos are service providers. They’re providing entertainment to their customers. Everybody knows that the games are stacked in the casino’s favor.\\n\\nSimilarly, I think you could make an argument—and I think this is probably quite accurate—that RenTech and all other quant firms like them are providing a service to the market, in that they are allowing trades that people want to make to happen faster and at much lower spreads.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely. That is the undeniable, yes, quant funds create value in the world thing, which (I think) it’s very easy to say quant funds provide no value because it’s zero sum, they’re not actually providing the capital to businesses to do something with. They’re purely looking to do an arbitrage or any of the strategies we’ve talked about this episode.\\n\\nBut you’re totally right that there is a value to market liquidity. Creating more depth to a market makes it so that if we go back to the era that Renaissance was started, there’s no chance that retail is able to function like it does today with zero transaction fees and people able to invest in all these different companies at near real time.\\n\\nDavid: And any single one of us can go buy a security in just about any market, at just about any time of day, pretty much instantaneously, and get a very, very, very granular price on it. None of which used to be true.\\n\\nBen: The fact that there is a whole bunch of quant funds, hedge funds out there that are ready to be willing counterparties to anyone who wants to trade, that is a service. You’re right.\\n\\nThey’re also not all Medallion. They actually don’t all have an edge. Even though they might purport to, lots of them are going to lose money to you.\\n\\nDavid: Lots of them lose money. You too, listeners could beat the market. Not investment advice. Please don’t try.\\n\\nBen: On average, Medallion will not lose money to you. But there are plenty of other hedge funds out there, high frequency shops, and counterparties for you where you could take them. That’s just not Jim Simons.\\n\\nDavid: There’s this great, great vignette at the end of Greg’s book. When was it? It was during one of the selloffs in the mid-20-teens in the market, where Jim calls the head of his family office. He’s long retired from RenTech at this point, calls the head of his family office and says, what should we do with all the selloff in the market? And it’s like, you’re Jim Simons.\\n\\nBen: Right. You’re Jim Simons. What should we do?\\n\\nDavid: What should we do, yeah.\\n\\nBen: All humans are fallible.\\n\\nDavid: Totally.\\n\\nBen: A couple of other squintable, the value creation exists. It’s easy to knock that all these smart people are going into finance, and you wish they were doing something more productive for the world. At the end of the day, humans are going to do what they’re incented to do, absent a larger global concern that is incredibly motivating to people.\\n\\nYou look at World War II, people’s level of patriotism and wanting to go save the world from evil was a huge, unbelievable motivating factor to move mountains. When that is absent or when people feel that there’s some existential thing that is absent, they’re going to go do what’s best for them and their family. If they’re an empire builder, go build empires. If they’re fierce capitalists, go make a bunch of money. The system is set up the way that it is. You can be mad about that.\\n\\nGiven that, okay, people are going to go engage in quantitative finance as a lucrative profession. Fortunately, there’s a bunch of valuable stuff that comes out of that. I think that is often missed is that these really lucrative professions and businesses can often produce R&D that becomes valuable elsewhere.\\n\\nFor example, we just did this big NVIDIA series. What do you think Mellanox was used for before large language models?\\n\\nDavid: This is such a really mind-blowing point here in value creation, value capture. Go for it, take it away.\\n\\nBen: There’s not much to it other than a huge amount of InfiniBand was used by high frequency trading firms. I don’t know for sure, but I think Mellanox built their business on quant finance. That’s one of many examples. Now you know that has limits, but I think it goes overlooked that there’s a lot of technology innovation here.\\n\\nDavid: These are all great points they all came up in the research. I totally agree with all of them. It is, in my opinion, false to say that quantitative finance does not create value for the world. It definitely does in my opinion.\\n\\nBen: But does it create anywhere near as much as it captures?\\n\\nDavid: That said, they’re really, really good at value capture. This is not Wikipedia here. This is about as far away on the spectrum as you can get.\\n\\nBen: There’s a great, always sunny in Philadelphia, where Frank—Danny DeVito—goes back to his whatever business he founded in the 80s. He’s in his pin stripes and stuff again, taken back over, and he brings Charlie with him. Charlie like, so Frank, what does the business? What do we do here? What does the business make? Danny DeVito looks at him and he goes, what do you mean? We make money? He’s like, no, no. What do you build? He goes, we build wealth. I think that’s a pretty good meme for what’s going on here.\\n\\nDvid: Totally. Very, very good at value capture, too.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Okay, bear-bull. This was a section that we had for a long time, that we did not put in the last episode, and boy did we hear about it. Listeners, thank you so much for expressing your concern. Bear versus bull is unkilled and it is back.\\n\\nDavid: Resurrected like a phoenix.\\n\\nBen: Resurrected. However, this is about the lamest episode to resurrect it on. What’s the bull case for RenTech?\\n\\nDavid: Past performance is an indicator of future success.\\n\\nBen: They’re going to keep attracting all the smartest people in the world. They’re going to have the ability to keep their incredibly unique culture. They’re not going to get tempted to let the business of institutional funds become the dominant business. Keep on keeping on is basically the bull case. Maybe that they’re actually still ahead.\\n\\nDavid: The bull case for the GP and LP stakeholders in Medallion, which is, I don’t know, 500 people in the world, and none of the rest of us can get any exposure to it.\\n\\nBen: The bear case is things are changing. I think things are changing basically on any axis is the bear case for them. Things are changing where competitors are catching up, maybe. Maybe the fact that the tech industry has figured out these large language models, maybe that trickles into making it easier to compete with RenTech. It’s a blurry line, but it is plausible.\\n\\nMaybe RenTech actually was here a decade before everyone else, and now everyone else has arrived to the party. There are things that are changing maybe about their culture. Jim Simons has been gone for a long time. Bob Mercer is no longer a co-CEO. Peter Brown is a co-CEO and they just announced that they’re making the guy who was in charge of the institutional funds, David Lippe, is becoming a co-CEO as well.\\n\\nMaybe there’s a bear case around that, that someone from the institutional side of the house is becoming the current co-CEO, and maybe eventually CEO if you believe the Medallion is the special thing and the institutional funds are a blemish on the business. They’re the Hermès Apple watch strap in David’s parlance. Maybe that’s a bear case.\\n\\nMaybe there’s a bear case that their talent is becoming the same as everyone else’s talent. When you look on LinkedIn, I recognize a lot of the companies that people worked at, who are more junior at RenTech and in the past. I think it would’ve been all people just out of university research shops. I think if it’s true that they’re starting to see the same talent flow as everyone else, that would be concerning. These things are all narratives you can concoct and really no way to know if they’re true or not.\\n\\nDavid: There’s no way for us to know any of this because there’s no way to know any of this.\\n\\nBen: It’s all a secret.\\n\\nDavid: Our new ending section, the splinter in our minds, the takeaway.\\n\\nBen: The one thing you can’t stop thinking about.\\n\\nDavid: What is the one thing for each of us personally from doing this work over the past month on RenTech that sticks with us? For me, perhaps this is obvious from my little diatribe on the tapestry. I just think this is such a powerful example of the power of incentives, getting them right, and setting them up right. And culture, too. I don’t want to shortchange that. I think the culture of managing an academic environment in a fashion like a lab, but without letting it spin into the frivolity of a lab that Jim Simons set up.\\n\\nBen: In other words, early Google.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. This is like early Google, exactly. There historically has not, from our research and as best as we can tell currently, is not anything going on at RenTech that is frivolous. They are all very focused, which again, to me then speaks back to the power of incentives.\\n\\nWhen you’re there with less than 400 people, and on the research and engineering side less than 200 people, and those colleagues who you work with are the sole purveyors, supervisors, and beneficiaries of all of this that you’re doing, that is so powerful. I can’t think of anywhere else like that in the world. Maybe some venture funds or other investment firms, but not on a day-to-day fully liquid with returns like this. There’s nothing like it.\\n\\nBen: Pure gasoline right into the veins.\\n\\nDavid: Which is not to say I would necessarily want to work there. I think I would not, but it is truly unique.\\n\\nBen: The one thing I can’t stop thinking about is the idea of the complex adaptive system that I was talking about earlier. I think from what everything we can tell from the outside, Renaissance actually has built a large scale computer system that discovers relationships between different entities in the world—stocks, commodities, bond prices—and whether it can explain them or not, it is correct most of the time. It might be a small most, but all you need is most, then you can operate a casino business.\\n\\nThat is my takeaway is that they are the house and they have an edge, and that edge is predicated on a graph of all the relationships between these entities that we think are just noise, and they know the signal.\\n\\nDavid: It does make you wonder to what you were talking about with the tech industry “catching up” in recent years. How hard is it to build this now given the technology open source and otherwise that’s available for sale out there.\\n\\nBen: That’s the bear case. I don’t know.\\n\\nDavid: Then what’s going to happen? By nature, given that it’s a complex adaptive system, if you can now buy and build this, well, the returns will get arbitraged down.\\n\\nBen: Yup. All right. Should we have some fun, carve outs?\\n\\nDavid: Let’s have some fun.\\n\\nBen: Sweet. All right, listeners, I have three. People have been expressing that they’re loving the carve out section, so I decided to load them up a little bit more.\\n\\nDavid: That’s right. Let’s indulge.\\n\\nBen: We’ll spin off a whole new podcast called Carve-outs.\\n\\nDavid: Forty-four percent carry. Let’s go.\\n\\nBen: I have one announcement, one TV show, and one other fun thing for listeners. First the announcement. David and I are going to be emceeing Modern Treasury Transfer again this year. If payments are your thing, you should come join us. It was awesome last year. It’ll be May 15th, 2024 in San Francisco, and we’ll put a link in the show notes to register. We would love to see you there.\\n\\nDavid: Can’t wait.\\n\\nBen: My second one is a TV show, and it is actually Acquired-related. It is called The New Look on Apple TV+.\\n\\nDavid: Oh yes. But Christian, it is such a new look.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. For anyone who listened to the LVMH episode, remember we were talking about the groundbreaking thing that Christian Dior did was his collection, The New Look, that was a post–World War II explosion onto the scene.\\n\\nDavid: Celebration of life.\\n\\nBen: Gone are the days of the militaristic, boxy clothing, and now we are in with these seductive and dare I say…\\n\\nDavid: Sumptuous materials. War rationing is over.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. Provocative dresses. The Apple TV show is this incredible drama of flashbacks to the harrowing wartime experiences of Christian Dior, of Balenciaga, of Coco Chanel, everything they went through, and how all their paths crossed.\\n\\nDavid: Oh, Coco’s in it?\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Oh wow. How do they treat that?\\n\\nBen: It will be very interesting if a lot of people watch this show to see if that affects product sales of Chanel. I’m also very curious for people who are watching—feel free to put a thing in the Slack and carve-outs—do you think she’s a sympathetic figure? Do you think she’s a villainist figure? I’m curious how you think of her portrayal versus reality.\\n\\nDavid: There’s the whole crazy thing with Chanel where the company ends up getting bought by Chanel the perfume division, which is the two Jewish brothers in New York.\\n\\nBen: The Wertheimers. Indeed. Oh God, we got to do a Chanel episode at some point. But The New Look on Apple TV+, I promise you, whether or not fashion luxury is your thing, it’s a beautiful and harrowing story.\\n\\nDavid: As you and listeners know, I’m not a TV guy, but this is so up my alley.\\n\\nBen: The whole thing. It takes place in wartime Paris.\\n\\nDavid: All right. I got to watch it.\\n\\nBen: You got to watch it. My third one is a fun thing for listeners. After our Nike episode, the president of Cole Haan—if you listen to the episode, you now know is its own company spun out from Nike years ago—reached out, and it turns out, he, like all of you, is also an Acquired listener. We were chatting and he brought up the idea that they’d be happy to create a specific Cole Haan deal for Acquired listeners. I told them, frankly, if it’s good enough, then I’ll share it on air.\\n\\nDavid: To be clear, this is not a sponsorship. This is just he’s a fan and reached out to us.\\n\\nBen: And I’ve owned a bunch of Cole Haan products over the years and have really liked them. For 35% off anything, you can go to colehaan.com/acquired or use the code ACQUIRED35 at checkout. Thank you to Dave for providing this to us. This is only live, I think for a couple of weeks, so if you’re listening to this episode soon after it drops, go check it out. I think they intentionally want to cut it off at some point, so it doesn’t get shared around all the coupon sites. But fun thing for Acquired listeners.\\n\\nDavid: Super cool. He likes Acquired and wanted to share the love back.\\n\\nBen: Love it.\\n\\nDavid: I love it.\\n\\nBen: All right, David, your carve outs.\\n\\nDavid: My carveout is related to The New Look in a very different way, but both video consumption, fashion, luxury, and style. It is the Class of Palm Beach, Instagram, and TikTok account. This is so great.\\n\\nBen: David, you and I go to Palm Beach for two days and you get hooked on.\\n\\nDavid: This is amazing. Ben and I went to Palm Beach for a couple of days for a speaking event recently, which was amazing. I’d never been to Palm Beach before.\\n\\nBen: It is nice.\\n\\nDavid: So great. We didn’t knowingly spot any RenTech people there, but we may have.\\n\\nBen: We did knowingly spot some Birkin bags, though.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, the style in Palm Beach. We had just recorded the Hermes episode, and oh man, I was so pleased to be there. Then I got home and Jenny (my wife) was like, do you not know the Class of Palm Beach TikTok account?\\n\\nBen: And David’s like, I’m a thousand. I have no idea what you’re talking about, Jenny.\\n\\nDavid: Right, right, right. I live under a rock. I’m a dad, and she showed it to me. This is a woman who lives in Palm Beach. She goes around, posts on Instagram and on TikTok, and she just interviews people on the street about what brands they’re wearing, their style. It is magnificent.\\n\\nMy favorite is—we’ll see if we can find it and link to it in the show notes—there’s a video of one woman who’s being interviewed who has a Mini Kelly inside her Birkin.\\n\\nBen: Excess, truly excess.\\n\\nDavid: And that’s when I was hooked. I was just like, this is the greatest thing I have ever watched. I’m obsessed.\\n\\nBen: All right. If I use TikTok, I would subscribe.\\n\\nDavid: You can get it on Instagram too.\\n\\nBen: Oh, all right. Good.\\n\\nDavid: I actually subscribed the Acquired account on Instagram to Class of Palm Beach. I don’t know how many people we’re following. It’s not many, but we are following Class of Palm Beach.\\n\\nBen: Look at David opening up our Instagram account. You’re so youthful.\\n\\nDavid: I know.\\n\\nBen: All right, listeners, well, a huge, huge thank you to J.P. Morgan Payments, ServiceNow, and Vanta. You can click the link in the show notes to learn more. David, I know you’ve got some thank yous from folks you talked with and a few of them we did together.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. For sources for this episode who are so generous with their time and thoughts. First, a huge thank you to Greg Zuckerman, author of The Man Who Solved the Market, the canonical book out there about RenTech and Jim Simons.\\n\\nGreg was super generous spending time, talking to us, emailing with us, making sure we’re getting things right. He and the book is the canonical source of Medallion’s Investment Returns. I know he worked so hard to get that table together that is now all over the Internet as it should be.\\n\\nBen: It is crazy. Everywhere you hear that 66% number quoted, and that is from Greg’s analysis.\\n\\nDavid: Truly a service to us, to corporate historians, and financial historians everywhere that he did that research and got those returns.\\n\\nBen: There are a few other primary sources. There’s really not much, so we can actually list all of them here. There’s a congressional testimony of Peter Brown about the basket options thing. There’s Peter Brown doing an interview at GS exchanges, which again, many of the questions were straight out of Greg’s book and the stories told.\\n\\nDavid: It is a funny moment where Peter’s like, where are you getting these questions? How do you know all this stuff? And I’m like…\\n\\nBen: Come on.\\n\\nDavid: They’re in the book.\\n\\nBen: Clearly.\\n\\nThere’s a great book called The Quants, which is a little bit earlier—I think it’s 2011—so it’s not as updated as The Man Who Solved the Market. There are only a couple of chapters about RenTech, but some good stuff in there. Then there’s a good Bloomberg piece from 2016 that we’ll link to. I think between that and The Quants, it was the first time there was really anything at all that was published about RenTech. all those will be in the show notes.\\n\\nOther people to thank, David.\\n\\nDavid: Other people to thank, Howard Morgan who we spoke to, which was so fun to get a bunch of the first round history from him. Then of course the founding of RenTech, partnering with Jim, and investing in each other’s funds and all that. So fun.\\n\\nBrett Harrison, who you mentioned, Ben. Brett is now building Architect, which—I love this; this is so needed in the world—the Interactive Brokers for the 21st century. Well, anybody who uses Interactive Brokers knows exactly the opportunity there, so thank you Brett.\\n\\nThen Matthew Granade, who I spoke with. Matt is the co-founder of Domino Data Lab, which is a great enterprise AI ops platform backed by Sequoia and many others. It allows model-driven businesses and products to accelerate research, increase collaboration, rapidly deliver new machine learning models, all of the things that we were talking about here with RenTech.\\n\\nMatt, before starting Domino Data, came out of the quant world. He was at Point72 and Bridgewater, which isn’t really quant sort of its own thing, but he was a long-time senior employee at both of those firms, and he gave us great, great perspective on the landscape of everybody out there and where RenTech fits in.\\n\\nBen: Awesome. Well, if you liked this episode, you should check out our Berkshire Hathaway episodes from a few years ago for a very different style to investing.\\n\\nYou can sign up for new episode emails at acquired.fm/email.

       "  'about': 'In luxury, there’s Hermès… and there’s everyone else. Stewarded by one French family over six generations, Hermès sells the absolute pinnacle of the French luxury dream. Loyal clients will waityearssimply for the opportunity to buy one of the company’s flagship Birkin or Kelly bags. Unlike every other luxury brand, Hermès: And yet everyone knows who they are and what they represent. But, despite all their iconoclasm, this is not a company that’s stood still for six generations. Unbeknownst to most, Hermès has completely reinvented itself at least three times in its 187-year history. Including most recently (and most dramatically) by the family’s current leaders, who responded to LVMH and Bernard Arnault’s 2010 takeover attempt by pursuing a radical strategy — scaling hand craftsmanship. And in the process they turned the company from a sleepy, ~$10B family enterprise into a $200B market cap European giant. Tune in for one incredible story!\\u200d',\n",
       "  'transcript': 'Ben: I don\\'t know if you realize this. Hermes is reporting earnings in two days.\\n\\nDavid: Yes.\\n\\nBen: At first I was like, we should probably not do this episode because their annual report comes out in two days. What if we\\'re not current? And then I realized this is Hermes. The short term is of no consequence.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Also, the Hermes annual reports are the most beautiful annual reports ever created in the history of the financialization of mankind.\\n\\nBen: You might think you can\\'t do all of your charts in orange, you need different colors, but you would be wrong.\\n\\nDavid: The illustrations, the themes, you can tell they care.\\n\\nBen: You can tell. All right, let\\'s do it.\\n\\nDavid: Let\\'s do it.\\n\\nBen: \\xa0Welcome to season 14, episode 2 of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. I\\'m Ben Gilbert.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'m David Rosenthal.\\n\\nBen: We are your hosts. Today, we tell the story of a handbag company that won\\'t sell you a handbag, a traditional saddle maker that makes very little of their revenue from saddles, a company that somehow has grown to be worth over 200 billion despite rejecting manufacturing efficiencies and economies of scale, a company so obsessed with craft and a reputation for quality that they have stayed independent while every other luxury brand has merged into conglomerates.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, listeners. Today, we tell the oldest story we have ever told here on Acquired, older than Standard Oil or the New York Times. This company dates back to 1837 in Paris, France. The crown jewel of the luxury industry, Hermès.\\n\\nDavid: Ben, do you know what company was also founded in 1837 that we have discussed quite a bit on Acquired?\\n\\nBen: No, I do not, David.\\n\\nDavid: That would be the other iconic color luxury company, Tiffany.\\n\\nBen: Really?\\n\\nDavid: Also founded in 1837.\\n\\nBen: Chuck T. This episode, listeners, has been probably just under 12 months in the making. LVMH was just after one year ago, and it was in that episode that I feel like I got a real penchant for everything that Hermes stood for. After 187 years, still under family control, they\\'re on their sixth generation of family leadership at the helm. David, everything Hermes does is just so focused, intentional, and pure. As much as they get lumped together with brands owned by LVMH, they are in many ways the anti LVMH.\\n\\nDavid: We\\'ve got a great discussion of that later in the episode. I used to think that and I no longer think that. But after our LVMH episode, you were so inspired by learning about Hermes. You went out and you bought your first luxury object. It was not an LVMH brand.\\n\\nBen: Yes, that is true. My wife and I were on our honeymoon, listeners, after LVMH, so last summer. We were in Aix-en-Provence, and we walked by an Hermès store. I thought that this would be a great time to go in and get each other something as a honeymoon gift. My wife got a little twilly scarf, and I got an Hermès belt. It\\'s the only luxury item I own of any traditional luxury brand.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, as foreshadowed on our holiday special episode a couple months ago.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, if you want to know every time an episode drops, you can sign up at acquired.fm/email. You\\'ll get hints at what the next episode will be and follow up facts from previous episodes when we learn new information. Come discuss this episode with us at acquired.fm/slack. Come check out our second show, ACQ2, where we interview founders, investors, and experts, often as follow ups to these episodes. Before we dive in, we want to briefly share that our presenting sponsor this season is JP Morgan, specifically their incredible payments business.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. We really uncovered the breadth of JP Morgan Payments as we went deep into industry research for our Visa episode last year. Just like how we say every company has a story, every company\\'s story is powered by payments. JP Morgan Payments turns out to be a part of so many of our Acquired companies\\' journeys.\\n\\nBen: With that, this show is not investment advice. David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss, and this show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. David, I feel like we\\'re starting before 1837.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, but not too much before 1837.\\n\\nBen: All right, we\\'re not going to the Egyptian invention of the handbag or anything like that.\\n\\nDavid: Boy, let me tell you, I was tempted. If you read The Luxury Strategy, which is a great book that we\\'ve referenced many times on Acquired, they start back 50,000 years ago. We start in 1801, not in Paris, not even in France. As we\\'ve been talking about, the land of beauty, luxury, enlightenment, where Hermes, of course, was founded and is still based today.\\n\\nUniquely, Hermes still does 85% of their production by hand, by Mastercraft\\'s people in France, as we will talk a lot about. But instead, we start in the land of hardness and precision of engineering, of exactitude, the future land of the Porsches of the world. That is right, Germany.\\n\\nBen: A century before the Porsches and Volkswagens of the world.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, where Thierry Hermes was born in the town of Krefeld, which is just outside of Dusseldorf, where he\\'s the sixth child of a family of innkeepers.\\n\\nBen: Hermes, is that a German name? A French name?\\n\\nDavid: Hermes is obviously not a German name, even I know that. Thierry\\'s father was French and his mother was German. Shortly after Thierry is born, he was born in 1801, something pretty major happens in France and then throughout continental Europe that will become very, very important to our story here, and that is that Napoleon comes to power in France. This is the era we\\'re talking about here. Napoleon.\\n\\nBen: We finally did it here on Acquired, your AP European history class has now merged with business history We\\'re covering Napoleon.\\n\\nDavid: He is critical to what is about to happen here. In the aftermath of the French Revolution, Napoleon essentially stages a coup, declares himself emperor, first of France, and then he basically begins conquering all of continental Europe, including Germany. This Napoleonic conquest was, at the same time, both the very best thing that could happen to young Thierry, It leads directly to Hermes.\\n\\nAlso, the very worst and truly worst, all this conquering, this glory of France that we\\'re going to talk about becomes important to Hermes, that\\'s the result of wars. Thierry\\'s entire family, his parents, his mom, his dad, all five of his siblings, are all killed either directly in the Napoleonic wars or by disease and famine as a result of this. Absolutely terrible. The result is that Thierry, by the time he\\'s 20 years old, he\\'s an orphan. He is the last Hermes left.\\n\\nBen: David, 1821, pretty rough time out in the world. Do you know who was born in this year, 1821, and was also an orphan? We have talked about them on Acquired.\\n\\nDavid: Obviously not Rockefeller, which is where my mind first went, because we talk a lot about his dad.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Louis Vuitton himself.\\n\\nDavid: He will also come up here in a minute.\\n\\nBen: Twenty years younger than Thierry Hermes, but also an orphan.\\n\\nDavid: Wow, I didn\\'t know he was also an orphan.\\n\\nBen: Yup.\\n\\nDavid: Wow, it\\'s just crazy. Two orphans, one of whom was German, go on to found the two most important, most French, most luxurious brands and really communicators of status in the modern world. That\\'s wild.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, especially crazy considering they both came from nothing. These people who would create the monikers of the elite of what would go on to be the symbols of wealth and nobility, came from nothing, were orphans, and at their greatest aspirations were craftspeople for the elite. They were almost servants.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. In 1821, Thierry leaves Krefeld, leaves Germany. He abandons his original destiny as an innkeeper. He moves to France, not to Paris, but to Normandy in the north. There, he becomes an apprentice under a master craftsman learning the art of equipage craftsmanship. Equipage is the business of outfitting horse drawn carriages. Who were the customers of horse drawn carriages? Ben, like you\\'re talking about.\\n\\nBen: The nobility.\\n\\nDavid: The nobility. Horses were extremely important to the world back then. The horse was the car. It was the Ford F150, it was the Toyota Camry. It was also the Rolls Royce that drew the carriage, and only the Rolls Royces were the carriages.\\n\\nWhen Thierry moves to Normandy and takes up as an apprentice, he apprentices for 16 years. It\\'s not until 1837 that he finally moves to Paris as now a master craftsman and opens up his own shop in Paris on the Rue Basse-du-Rempart in the 9th arrondissement, which that whole street today no longer exists.There, he establishes himself as really quite an exceptional harness maker for horse drawn carriages.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear to me at this point if he\\'s using the famous saddle stitch, which becomes so important to Hermes. The reason it\\'s unclear to me is because he\\'s not making saddles. Saddles are what other people are making. It\\'s not that the nobility don\\'t ride horses. They do, but they ride horses like the elite today drive a Ferrari. It\\'s not something they do every day.\\n\\nBen: Right. Their daily driver is a Bentley because someone else is driving them. They have a Ferrari for when they occasionally want to drive a Ferrari. They\\'ll climb in a saddle occasionally, but mostly they\\'re in the carriage.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. When Thierry arrives in Paris in 1837, he pretty quickly starts becoming known as really the best harness maker and carriage outfitter in Paris serving the nobility, which is pretty impressive. Here, he\\'s this immigrant from Germany, apprenticed in Normandy. He shows up in Paris. All of a sudden, he\\'s making the best stuff out there.\\n\\nBen: It turns out he was just really good at the craft.\\n\\nDavid: He had exceptionally good timing. We spoke about Napoleon a little bit earlier. When Thierry finally comes to Paris, at this point, Napoleon I has been defeated in the Battle of Waterloo. That was 1850, and France has now seesawed through a whole bunch of different republics, and the monarchy comes back. It\\'s crazy French history stuff.\\n\\nShortly after Thierry returns, Napoleon\\'s nephew, Napoleon III stages another coup and reestablishes the Empire in France. This is super important, Ben, to what you were talking about earlier about this guy\\'s an orphan. Louis Vuitton was an orphan. How did they become so important?\\n\\nWhen Napoleon III comes to power in France, he does two things. (1) He completely modernizes the city. If people have heard of the Baron Haussmann who rebuilt Paris, that happens at this time under Napoleon III. They transformed Paris from a medieval city with super tight streets. If you go up to Montmartre, those streets around there, that is old Paris. But when you think of the Eiffel Tower, the museums, the grand boulevards, the Champs-Élysées, that\\'s happening right at this time.\\n\\nThe Baron Haussmann, he\\'s like Robert Moses was in New York in the mid 20th century remaking New York. He is given full latitude and direction by Napoleon III to burn Paris to the ground and remake this city as a modern city.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: This is super important for Thierry and Hermes for two reasons. (1) In the old medieval streets in Paris, not that many people were going up and down them. Not that many people were going to see the nobility in their carriages and all their finery. Now you\\'ve got the Champs-Élysées, the Grand Boulevard, everything about the gallantry of Paris that we know today, is all on display now. This becomes really important for showing off for signifying your wealth, your status.\\n\\nThe other related thing here that happens with Napoleon and Napoleon III is that status is no longer just about what you were born into. In the old system, the nobility, the royalty, it was like you\\'re born noble or you\\'re not. It\\'s independent of how much money you have, what you do, or what influence you have. Under Napoleon, he brought in this modern idea that you could shift your class. He was essentially a nobody, and he became the emperor of Europe. That\\'ll completely upset the mindset of people.\\n\\nAll this is happening, this is the best thing that could ever happen to Thierry. He\\'s the best artisan, most exclusive crafter of carriageway of equipage. The city is being transformed so that this can all be displayed prominently. Social stratifications are becoming more blurry. People can spend money for the first time to buy status. Great for business.\\n\\nBen: These are the disruption waves that enabled him to create a business.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Before all this, before this era, there\\'s no way that this evolves into Hermes. Honestly, Louis Vuitton and what he\\'s doing with luggage and with trunks, there\\'s no way that that evolves into Louis Vuitton. Speaking of, both Hermes and Vuitton have one really important client, a key influencer, so to speak, that they both land at this time.\\n\\nBen: I remember Louis Vuitton\\'s key client was the Empress Eugenie. Is Hermes the same client?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, the same client. Napoleon III\\'s wife, the Empress Eugenie, becomes a client of both of these men for her carriages, in the case of Hermes, and for her luggage and for her trunks. Actually, I think also for her packing. I think Louis Vuitton was the royal laities, I believe, and he packed the trunks. He was the luggage guy, Hermes was the carriage guy.\\n\\nBen: Which is so funny because that is still, in some ways, both of their legacy today.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, absolutely. Eugenie and everything going on at this time makes Louis Vuitton and makes Thierry Hermes. It\\'s interesting. Vuitton and luggage, that is inherently of the world that\\'s coming, the modern world. The train exists at this point in time, steam engines are a thing, and then the car is about to come, and Louis Vuitton, trunks, and luggage, all translates directly.\\n\\nBen: Right, it\\'s built for the upcoming world.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Not the case with Hermès. Actually today, I think this is one of the biggest strengths of Hermes and they still. The equestrian theme, the horse is so much of their brand. They talk about it so much of their products, the saddle stitching. It\\'s calling back to that other era, that pre modern era where the horse was primary.\\n\\nBen: Right. Hermes is deeply rooted in French history, in Parisian history, and really a key part of how France as a nation has the identity that it has today.\\n\\nDavid: But it would all be irrelevant if the brand didn\\'t translate out of the horse era and into the car era, which was not Thierry Hermes\\' doing, nor was it his son\\'s doing. Thierry dies in 1878. His son, Charles-Emile, takes over. He apprenticed coming up in the shop in exactly the same way that Thierry apprenticed. He just apprenticed for his dad. By the time he takes over, he\\'s been working in the shop as a craftsman for 20 years.\\n\\nBy the way, this family tradition and way of business continues to this day. Axel Dumas and Pierre-Alexis Dumas, who are the two descendants of Hermes, the sixth generation that are running the company today, Axel is the CEO and Pierre-Alexis is the artistic director, apprenticed in the business. When they were teenagers for five years after school, they went to the atelier, they learned the saddle stitch, they made bags, they made items with their hands.\\n\\nObviously, they also learned the business from their parents, but they\\'re not learning the business the way that the Arnault children are learning the business at LVMH as executives. They\\'re learning with their hands as craftspeople how to make this stuff, which is wild. Axel is the CEO of a $200 billion plus company.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s crazy. To bring it back to the late 1800s, I think the point you\\'re making here is, when Charles-Emile was apprenticing, there was no other example of what this company could become. He thought, why don\\'t I carry it on in exactly the same manner, Thierry, that you did? There\\'s not this grand ambition to innovate and change with the times, it\\'s well how do I learn exactly your craft exactly the way you do it and then continue that?\\n\\nDavid: Right. The business and the craft are intimately intertwined, they cannot be separated. This is a playbook theme I want to pull all the way forward, but it\\'s so critical to understand about Hermes and what really in my mind differentiates it from LVMH. LVMH, as we talked about on that episode, has world class best in the world business executives who partner with world class best in the world creatives.\\n\\nAt Hermes, these are not different people. Obviously, there is a different CEO and artistic director that are both members of the same family and who are cousins. But in spirit, they\\'re cut from the same cloth, they apprentice as creative craftspeople, and they collectively and the family, is in charge as much of the creative side of the house as they are of the business side.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, makes sense.\\n\\nDavid: Back to Charles-Emile and the second generation, he finally adds saddlery to the business. That\\'s his big expansion, he adds saddles. Again, as Paris is modernizing as you can now buy your way into status, for the first time in Paris, you couldn\\'t be seen riding in addition to carriages.\\n\\nThe ideal of what it is to be a noble person or a noble person of status has changed. It\\'s no longer just, oh, I\\'m a leisurely courtier. It\\'s like, no, I\\'m Baron Haussmann. I am doing things for the state, for the country. It\\'s like America in its way and the Rockefellers.\\n\\nBen: Right. You\\'re not just famous for being famous, you are famous because you\\'ve achieved something, you\\'re in the act of achieving something, or you hold a high office in which you were elected or appointed to get a specific goal done. You\\'re on the move. You got stuff to do, and you got to get there.\\n\\nDavid: Exactly, and you need a saddle for that. Charles-Émile adds saddles. In 1880, he moves the workshop in the store to 24 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.\\n\\nBen: The famous address.\\n\\nDavid: The building that is today known as Le Faubourg by everybody in the Hermes universe. This street and this location is one of the most iconic streets in the world, buildings in the world, headquarters in the world.\\n\\nBen: It was stunning to walk it last summer when I was there. You can feel the presence of Hermes and all the other brands that are there.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré is where the French presidential residence is. It\\'s where the British embassy is. It\\'s where French Vogue is today, probably because Hermès is there and because all of the other luxury flagships are there.\\n\\nCharles Emile runs the business for 25 years. He adds saddles, he moves the company to the Faubourg. In 1902, he retires. His two sons, Adolphe and Emile, who have apprenticed in the business just like him, just like every generation will do for many generations to come, take over. They change the name of the company to Hermes Freres, Hermes Brothers, because the two brothers are now running the company.\\n\\nBen: And they\\'re going to do this forever together, and they\\'re going to be thick as thieves. They are of one mind on how this company should go.\\n\\nDavid: They\\'ve been apprenticed together, going to be like Axel and Pierre-Alexis today. Of the two brothers, I think it is fair to say that Emile, who I believe is the younger brother, is the much more ambitious and much more adventurous one.\\n\\nThere\\'s this great story that in the late 1890s, before his father Charles-Emile retires, the young Emile sets off to conquer Russia for Hermes. He literally gets on a train with a notebook and a suitcase filled with miniature versions of the saddles and the harnesses that Hermes makes. He just finds his way into the Tsar of Russia\\'s court and lands him as a customer.\\n\\nBen: That is wild.\\n\\nDavid: Unreal. They have to staff up a whole new atelier with 80 craftspeople to fulfill all the orders for the Tsar in Russia.\\n\\nBen: Whoa.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. This is Emile. He\\'s going places. Right as he and Adolphe are taking over at the end of Charles-Emile\\'s tenure, they decide to introduce a new product. They\\'re not thinking that this is going to be a big thing at the time. Some of their customers, again, now that they\\'ve added saddles, once they get off the horse, they want something to carry the saddle and maybe their riding boots with them while the horse is in the stables wherever they\\'re going.\\n\\nThey say, great, we can help you with this. They introduce the Haut a Courroies bag, which translates as the high belted bag to carry saddles and boots for their clients. Like I\\'m saying here, this was intended to be an accessory to the main business of équipage and saddles, the equestrian business. It\\'s not really practical for anything else. I don\\'t know why anybody else would want a big tote bag that could carry your boots.\\n\\nBen: What\\'s this bag look like?\\n\\nDavid: This bag looks exactly like the Birkins and the Kellys today, except a lot bigger.\\n\\nBen: Interesting. Because you\\'re putting a whole saddle in it, like you\\'re de-saddling your horse, and then you\\'re putting that in this bag?\\n\\nDavid: Yup, but it has the same trapezoid shape. It has the crossover belt, the Haut a Courroies that means the high belted bag. It has the belt. It has the turnstile lock closure for the belt at the top of the bag.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: This accessory that we\\'re going to add to the business becomes the spiritual heritage to the business today.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s crazy. It\\'s like if Apple eventually transitioned to being not the Vision Pro company, but the Vision Pro carrying case company.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Did you get the carry case by the way?\\n\\nBen: No, I\\'m not going to spend another $200 on that.\\n\\nDavid: That thing looks like a balloon. It\\'s enormous.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and it takes up your whole backpack.\\n\\nDavid: This bag, this accessory that would become the Kelly and then the Birkin, they introduced it just at the right time. It\\'s 1902, as Charles-Emile is retiring. This idea of this bag that you would put stuff in, because you wouldn\\'t bring a bag on a train—if you\\'re of this class, you need a trunk. You need a flat pack trunk that Louis Vuitton is going to make for you. None of these three men could have seen it at the time, but this accessory to the real business of saddles, horses, and harnesses was going to become the perfect transition to move Hermes into the age of the automobile. Before we tell that story...\\n\\nBen: Yes, we mentioned Hermes founded in 1837 as the oldest company we\\'ve covered on Acquired, but we might have to caveat that.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Our presenting partner this season is JP Morgan Payments. JP Morgan Chase traces its heritage back to 1799.\\n\\nBen: Over 200 years, incredible. You only survive as long as Hermes or JP Morgan with a relentless focus on the long term and exceptionally high quality bar, and counterintuitively when talking about handbags and banks, technical innovation, which is exactly the JPMorgan Payments\\' story.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Their current payments business was officially forged a few years ago, but many of the capabilities and products came from different parts of the firm, which were already powering the whole payments industry. You can trace their merchant acquiring to the 90s, their treasury products to well before then, and even their blockchain work started earlier than most in the mid 2010s.\\n\\nWhen they combined all that together under one group, it really became a one of a kind, end of one business, a portfolio of treasury, online commerce, point of sale, global trade, card, cash management, fraud prevention, analytics, and more, a one stop payment shop for businesses of all sizes.\\n\\nBen: Yup. When you move 10 trillion a day in 160 countries and 120 currencies, these learnings really compound. That is exactly the story of their new offering, Embedded Banking. This actually reminds me a bit of our episode on Amazon and AWS on how companies can take internal capabilities and scale them externally as brand new products.\\n\\nIn this case, JP Morgan said, hey, we already facilitate credit card acceptance. We manage KYC and anti-money laundering. We pool money and split across virtual ledgers here. We disperse funds. Wow. We can embed all of these into our customers\\' marketplace businesses to power their end to end payments for buyers and sellers and lower risk across the whole ecosystem.\\n\\nDavid: While Hermes explicitly avoids ecommerce for their most coveted products, as we will talk about later, for the other 99% of you out there, that\\'s probably not your strategy. You want to do more business online. Large retailers are increasingly adopting a digital marketplace strategy to connect buyers and sellers directly. But for the underlying platform, whether that\\'s B2C or B2B, there\\'s a lot of complexities that come with having a frictionless payments experience. You have to create and manage the seller bank accounts, money movement, and most importantly, who\\'s going to take on the compliance and risk of holding and dispersing the funds, the third party seller or the platform?\\n\\nBen: Yup. Macy\\'s is a great example. They wanted to offer more selection to customers and support diverse owned small businesses at the same time. But Macy\\'s needed a solution to onboard sellers seamlessly and manage the state by state complexity of the payouts. They turned to JP Morgan payments and their embedded banking solutions. which enables a large number of suppliers and their bank account details on a single platform supported by tokenization and utilizing a single API integration. This frictionless and secure payment solution worked, to say the least. Macy\\'s nearly doubled its marketplace sellers in the first quarter of 2023 and increased revenue by 50%.\\n\\nDavid: Whether you\\'re in retail, luxury, or really any industry, there\\'s a clear growth opportunity from having an end to end payment solution. Head on over to jpmorgan.com/acquired to discover more payment solutions driving growth for businesses, whether that\\'s Fortune 500 startups or any stage in between. Also, if you\\'re heading to the retail conference Shop Talk in Las Vegas in March, be sure to stop by the JP Morgan payments booth where you can learn more directly from their team of experts.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Thank you, JP Morgan. Now, David, how was Hermes perfectly positioned for the age of the automobile with this new accessory?\\n\\nDavid: This is wild. I suspect you probably also found this in research, but when I did, my mind melted. During World War I, in 1916, Emile becomes an officer in the French military. The military sends him to the United States to learn about US industrial and military production. He\\'s a leading industrialist in France at this time, shall we say? One of the people that he gets sent to meet with is, do you know about this, Ben?\\n\\nBen: No, I have no idea.\\n\\nDavid: I can\\'t believe you didn\\'t find this.\\n\\nBen: No.\\n\\nDavid: He meets with Henry Ford. He goes to Detroit. He sees the assembly lines. He sees the car, he sees the future.\\n\\nBen: He sees the assembly lines and then he had blinders on? He\\'s like, oh, pay no attention to the manufacturing efficiencies they\\'ve got going on over there.\\n\\nDavid: This is what\\'s so funny. No, he\\'s like, this is unbelievable. To the manufacturing efficiency\\'s point, he actually does take some elements of the assembly lines and brings them back to Hermes. It\\'s not like they\\'re anti-efficiency. They\\'re pro efficiency, but in the context of being a craft, non-mechanized human master craftsman built object.\\n\\nHe actually does take some of the production ideas from Henry Ford, but more importantly, he\\'s looking at this place and he\\'s like, my God, there is a Model T rolling off the assembly line every three minutes. Ford at this point is producing half a million cars per year. Everybody knew about the automobile, but this is a different arrow. This is the same time as when we talked about our Novo Nordisk episode about the start of that company, where news didn\\'t reach Europe. This wasn\\'t a global world. Emile getting this window, literally seeing the assembly lines in Detroit, he\\'s like, whoa, Once this war is over, the world is going to change forever.\\n\\nBen: Okay. Emile both figures out how to open business in Russia and goes to America, meets with Henry Ford, understands the automobile is going to change the world.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, he\\'s quite the character, this guy. The other thing he finds in America is, I know you know this one, the zipper.\\n\\nBen: Yes, or as it was originally called...\\n\\nDavid: The close-all.\\n\\nBen: Yes, which really does not have the same ring to it, I\\'m glad we changed it to zipper.\\n\\nDavid: I couldn\\'t believe this. The zipper was a late 1800s, early 1900s invention in America. It was primarily used for Industrial use cases. In this case, it was zippering closed the hood of a car,\\n\\nBen: I think a military car.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, where Emile first sees it. It\\'s not at the Ford factory. I think it actually might have been in Canada on the later leg of his journey where he sees it on the car. It was also used for opening and closing boots. That is how the name zipper came to be. I think it was the BF Goodrich company.\\n\\nBen: Really?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I believe they made a brand of boot with this close-all function and they called it the zipper, and that\\'s where the zipper came from. Regardless, enterprising young Emile, he tracks down the inventor of the zipper, the holder of the patent in America. He obtains an exclusive license for two years in France. This literally is like the Novo Nordisk episode.\\n\\nBen: Totally.\\n\\nDavid: It brings it back to France and makes the first zippered products. He makes the first zippered jacket ever created anywhere in the world. It is a leather golf jacket for the British Duke of Windsor, the heir to the throne. It\\'s just amazing. For years in France, the zipper would be called the Hermes fastener in France.\\n\\nBen: Yes, that\\'s right.\\n\\nDavid: Just wild. I think they made the right decision not to make zippers the business and instead to stay focused on leather goods.\\n\\nBen: It does show their penchant for innovation, the idea that we can push the envelope forward in functionality and what people would be willing to wear. This guy\\'s a duke, and he\\'s wearing a zippered jacket. I\\'d imagine that drew some eyes at first.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and a golf jacket literally for use while playing golf, while playing sport. What more modern activity to happen here? Regardless though, the big thing for Hermes that he brings back is, oh, my God, the car is coming.\\n\\nBen: Okay. We\\'re still in Hermes family. Two brothers are running it. What\\'s next?\\n\\nDavid: When Emile comes back and he\\'s running around making zippered jackets, he\\'s collaborating with car companies, it leads to a rift between the two brothers. Adolphe, the older brother, he\\'s much more conservative. He wants to remain in the horse market. He\\'s depressed about the car coming. He\\'s like, hey, I just want to remain a niche leather worker. I\\'m not really cool with everything you\\'re doing here.\\n\\nBen: This is literally like he wants faster horses of the analogy of like, if you would ask people what they want, they\\'d say a faster horse. He\\'s stuck in horse land.\\n\\nDavid: Right. I don\\'t know if it was that he had his head in the sand or more just like he didn\\'t want to go build a big company.\\n\\nBen: Right, which I could understand.\\n\\nDavid: Totally, I can totally understand that. Either way, in 1919, Emile buys him out and says, I believe in my ability to lead this company, making this transition into the automobile era. Legend has it that he goes to the craftsman in the atelier above the shop in the Faubourg and says, okay, what are we going to do? What can we make with our hands here in this atelier that will interest our clients today?\\n\\nI think this is still legend around Hermes of like, what can we make with our hands that will interest our clients today? The obvious answer at the time is a version of the Haut a Courroies bag. It\\'s bags for these cars. If you want the most exquisite bags, the most exquisite things to show in your automobiles that you\\'re buying, who better than Hermes and finely handcrafted leather bags and accessories that you can outfit your car in the same way you could outfit your horse?\\n\\nBen: The business is now a meals and the business is now handbags.\\n\\nDavid: Once again, the timing and insight here like Thierry in the original case, what the automobile does, and it\\'s not just automobiles, it\\'s also improvements to trains and improvements to ships, the global rich, the global elite, start traveling a lot more. We\\'re now in the 1920s, the roaring 20s.\\n\\nThis is what F. Scott Fitzgerald is writing about. The visible symbols of wealth. It\\'s when you\\'re home, it\\'s in your car and the bags and the accessories you\\'re using with your car. But you\\'re also out traveling a lot more, you\\'re rubbing shoulders with elite all around the world.\\n\\nThe American elite are going to France. They\\'re going to Europe, vice versa. People are starting to travel around the world. People are traveling to Asia. People are traveling to the Middle East. People are traveling to South America. Emile\\'s going right along with all these people. Your luggage, your bags, that\\'s what you bring with you. That\\'s what you show.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Importantly, it\\'s not just that you\\'re trying to show a label, which is a little bit different than the modern version of luxury. It\\'s that you\\'re trying to have something really nicely crafted. When you show up somewhere, someone should just look at your luggage and go, wow, that is beautiful. Hermes is not yet a recognized brand, so merely slapping Hermes on it won\\'t do the trick. The way to wow the people that you want to wow is through the raw craftsmanship.\\n\\nDavid: The product itself, yes. In 1922, Emile\\'s wife famously complains that the large bag they\\'ve been making, the Haut a Courroies, the saddlebag, it\\'s too large to fit through car doors, so she asks for a smaller version. This launches the handbag business in 1925.\\n\\nBen: By the way, by this point, they\\'ve put the zipper on a handbag.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, exactly. Speaking of the zipper in 1925, they had ready to wear clothes like the legacy of the golf jacket here. The legend has it that they added clothes because a long time client came in and said, I am fed up with seeing my horse better dressed than me. Who knows if that\\'s true, but it\\'s a nice story. But they really go into this. In this modern world where the global wealthy, the global elite, are traveling, they\\'re seeing each other, what outward signifiers can they supply them? Clothes, in 1927 they had jewelry, in 1928 they had watches.\\n\\nBen: Something interesting that is different than the Hermes you know today, the way that they\\'re adding all of these things, they\\'re finding crafts people who are experts at particular crafts. Exactly what you\\'re talking about, David, a watchmaker. They\\'re finding a watchmaker and they\\'re saying, can we work with you on designing something uniquely Hermes, but you\\'re the craftsperson? We\\'re not trying to build this competency in-house.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s not right to say that they\\'re licensing products. It is a collaboration, but they are selling products in their stores that are not made end to end by Hermes employed craftsmen.\\n\\nBen: Right. It\\'s interesting, because they\\'re towing this line between first and foremost being a craftsman themselves, being a manufacturer, and being a designer, but also being a retailer, where they\\'re just bringing in other branded goods and selling it in their shop.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. I think all this is being figured out real time. These ideas of retailers versus brands, it was a much fuzzier line then than it was today. What does Hermes do? What does Emile do? They start opening up stores outside of Paris. Where are they going to go? They\\'re going to go to the travel destinations where their clients are going. The first store is in the Côte d\\'Azur in the south of France, and then they start opening up more stores around the world, again, not necessarily in the Londons, the Romes, or the New Yorks of the world. They\\'re opening them up in the travel destinations.\\n\\nBen: Their mindset around additional stores at this point is it\\'s for the same clientele in all the places that they travel.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and the clientele was primarily French at this point in time.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, or if not exclusively other than the czar.\\n\\nDavid: I suspect though that it was strategic of like, our French clients are going to go to these places, they\\'re going to rub shoulders with the Americans, with the British, and then we\\'re going to have a store there so that those Americans, those British, elite, can go purchase our products there too.\\n\\nBen: Right. This, by the way, is a different retail strategy than what they have today. Today, management insists that the idea is that each store is for the local clientele. We will only expand into an area if we feel that we can serve the local clientele that lives there well. That\\'s a recognition of the maturation of their business. The rich people are going to go find an Hermes store somewhere. It\\'s easy for them to travel somewhere, buy it on vacation. But if we\\'re going to open new stores, we should open it in places where there is a thriving new upper class who can buy the goods locally there in their city.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Now, I think some element of this certainly still exists. You had a nice time going into the Hermes store in X, right?\\n\\nBen: Yes, for sure. But it plays well for me as someone who is on vacation and shopping to believe that I\\'m shopping in a store that is for the locals. It\\'s less fun to be shopping somewhere that is very clearly created for you as a tourist.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, I think they very brilliantly walk this line. The products that the shops carry are very different. We\\'ll get into that later in the episode too. Back to this era, I think we\\'ve laid the groundwork of a few critical components of Hermes so far. First and most importantly, the craftsmanship, these things are handmade by artisans with their hands, and the family and the people who own the company are the chief artisans. That goes all the way back to Thierry.\\n\\nWe\\'ve talked about the connection to the legacy of French nobility, but not really French nobility. It\\'s like status, but accessible status for the first time in the world and the modernization of the world. We\\'ve talked now here about the true modernization of the company in the transition to the automobile era. What we haven\\'t talked about yet and what Hermes at this point certainly is not is this element of whimsy and art that is really, really critical, I think, to the company.\\n\\nBen: Yes. If you\\'ve ever been in an Hermes store, you can feel a warmth that doesn\\'t exist in other luxury stores. If you\\'re in a destination with a lot of luxury shops, you\\'ll walk past a lot of bright lights, mirrors, punch you in the face reds, and black and white, and you just feel like there\\'s a lot going on. Then you arrive at Hermes, and it feels warm, it feels soft, it feels welcoming, and it feels whimsical. There\\'s this almost dreamlike color palette that they use, starting with a base of orange and having this explosive rainbow of fun, but in some ways it all feels natural, from the earth, and just whimsy. I think that you nailed it, David, whimsical.\\n\\nDavid: This I think is really a very different thread than the original leather craftsmanship, and it is a critical one in the weaving of the Hermes business. This thread comes from the next generation of the family, specifically Robert Dumas. Emile had four children, but they were all daughters. Tragically, one died young, but the other three grew up and got married. Back in this day, women weren\\'t going to take over the business, unfortunately.\\n\\nBen: Right, same story as the New York times. There was a whole generation of daughters, none of the ox daughters get the business, so it goes over to the son in law, the souls burger, and now it\\'s the souls burger ox family that owns the business in the same way that Hermes is the Hermes-Dumas family. The son in law tends to do well in this early 20th century period of passing it down from, unfortunately, father not to daughter, but father to son-in-law.\\n\\nDavid: In this case, when you read about the Hermes family fortune today, it\\'s the Dumas family that are obviously the CEO and the artistic director that you hear about visibly. But really, I think all the sons-in-laws and all of their descendants become active in the business. There\\'s Robert Dumas, there\\'s Jean-René Guérin, and there\\'s Francis Puech.\\n\\nBen: And these are all son-in-laws.\\n\\nDavid: These are all son-in-laws. Those are the three family names that you still hear about to this day of the Hermès family. Back to Robert Dumas and the fourth generation, he brings this whimsy and real art into the business.\\n\\nBen: The way Hermes describes it today when you read their annual report is they talk about their trademark humor and imaginative flair. Despite the fact that they really are tied to this old French elite, they really don\\'t take themselves too seriously in all their products, especially the entry level ones. The Birkin is the Birkin. Yeah, they\\'ll do some special editions here and there, but there\\'s a weight to that product line. There\\'s an overall playfulness that\\'s exuded from the brand that comes from this era of leadership.\\n\\nDavid: Totally, and this comes from Robert. One of the first things he does when he joins the business is he redesigns the smaller Haut a Courroies bag, the handbag line, into what he calls the Sac a Depeches in 1935.\\n\\nBen: Really great name. It\\'s got a ring to it. I feel like that\\'s going to go be a viral hit and appear on Sex in the City.\\n\\nDavid: Beautiful, beautiful, elegant bag.\\n\\nBen: Sac a Depeches. Hold on to that one, listeners.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. A little later in the 1930s, he introduces the Chaine d\\'ancre bracelet, which is another iconic Hermes item in their jewelry métier.\\n\\nBen: Wait, David, I can\\'t let you get away with that métier. Please enlighten listeners. I know Hermes sprinkles around French words in all their literature, and it just expects Americans to deal with it. If it\\'s italicized, it\\'s French. You can go look up what it means yourself here on Acquired. David, tell us about a métier.\\n\\nDavid: A métier is someone\\'s work, but in the craftsman\\'s sense. A métier is like a trade. It\\'s like a craft profession. This is what Hermes calls their divisions. I feel gross even just saying the word divisions. There are 16 of them today, and jewelry, of course, is one of the métiers. I feel so much better saying métier.\\n\\nBen: I bet, yeah. There\\'s a levity here in the room now.\\n\\nDavid: Chaine d\\'ancre in French means chain of anchors, anchor chain. These are anchors like boat anchors. The way that this bracelet comes about is Robert is walking along the beach in Normandy one day, and he\\'s just inspired by the scene of these boat anchors on this foggy beach, so he makes a little sketch in his notebook. He plays with it, and then he decides he\\'s going to turn this into a bracelet.\\n\\nBen: Love it. An important thing to know here is when you\\'re buying Hermes products, they\\'re really not pushing the brand. There is not an iconic, recognizable Hermes H, horse and carriage logo, or bright color that you\\'re supposed to identify. This is really the origin of quiet luxury, where Hermes is handcrafting the highest quality product they can make a single artisan is the person making the good. When you receive it, you really are just aware that it\\'s the highest quality thing made by a single person with their blood, sweat, tears, love, a piece of them left inside.\\n\\nIt\\'s super different than luxury today because it is just not branded, and Hermes hadn\\'t even really developed the iconography yet that would become a Hermes\\' version of slightly louder luxury. Over the years, if you look at products now, the belts have an H. They incorporate horse motifs into designs on their ready-to-wear clothing, but that really wasn\\'t a thing yet in this era. \\xa0Hermes is on the lighter side of branding their goods today, but it\\'s still...\\n\\nDavid: They have to adapt to the market.\\n\\nBen: The customers want some way to let people know that they\\'re wearing an Hermes item, even if it\\'s lower key than other luxury brands, so Hermes builds that for them.\\n\\nDavid: The family talks about this a lot. The words they use is this is not a museum. There is this artistic element to what we do, but we are not a museum. We are a business, we have clients, and we are here to serve our clients. There is this push pull here.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Okay, what year are we that the bracelet is entering the market?\\n\\nDavid: That was in the mid 30s. In 1937, Robert introduces the other key pillar of Hermes products that is less talked about today relative to the bags and the leather goods, but for many, many decades was the bigger business.\\n\\nBen: Yes, I have numbers on this.\\n\\nDavid: Silk scarves, the Hermes classic silk scarves. This is the embodiment of this art and whimsy that we\\'re talking about. The silks that they use are the finest silks in the world. It takes 300 silk moth cocoons per scarf, as they will readily tell you to produce these things. But the designs on them, the artwork on them are whimsical like we said.\\n\\nThe first design, the Jeu des Omnibus et Dames Blanches or the white ladies at play, I guess you could translate that, is based on a woodblock engraving that Robert does. This is what an artist this guy is. He\\'s about to become CEO of Hermes, but he\\'s making woodblock engravings and then making silk scarves out of them. That\\'s the first design that they put out there, and quickly they become a huge, huge phenomenon with Hermes clients.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Fast forward all the way to 1988, when Axel Dumas has his very first internship with the company, this is crazy. Silk was 55% of the company\\'s sales. Leather was only 9%. You compare that to today, it is a completely different story. Leather is 43% and silk and textiles is 7%. There was a run. This was introduced when, David, the 30s?\\n\\nDavid: 1937.\\n\\nBen: 1937 through probably the 1990s, these silk scarves were the Hermes franchise. The reason this took off is it almost became part of the French woman\\'s uniform to have an Hermes scarf as a part of your outfit.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s funny you say the French woman\\'s uniform. Yes, that is entirely true, but the woman who really popularizes them around the globe is a British woman, specifically Queen Elizabeth.\\n\\nBen: I didn\\'t realize that. Really?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. This is so iconic, Queen Elizabeth. She starts wearing them as head scarves in the 1940s. Queen Elizabeth, she\\'s queen of England for 60, 70 years, and she\\'s wearing these scarves, these whimsical, playful scarves on her head as the queen of England.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating. This is a good time to talk about how these silk scarves are made. I was going to do this later when we talk about their modern day production process, but it turns out that their modern day production process is not that different than it used to be. Here is how Hermes scarves are made today. They are first sourcing the finest silk that they can find, which is now from their owned farms in Brazil. That\\'s where the silk comes from. Only 20 new designs are created every year and they retire old designs. There\\'s a Disney vault aspect to this.\\n\\nDavid: They\\'ll bring them out of the vault.\\n\\nBen: Yes. The pipeline to get a new design into the customers hands is two years. You might be asking yourself like, come on, why is this taking two years? That\\'s a ridiculous thing. Here is the process. They screen print every single scarf by hand.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, there\\'s no digital process here. It\\'s not like you\\'re going to custommake.com and ordering up some Hermes scarves.\\n\\nBen: Right. Some of the design does seem like it involves computers now. If you watch documentaries about the craftsman at Hermes, which there\\'s a couple of good ones we\\'ll link to in the show notes if you want to just watch Hermes crafts people at work, they do seem to be translating designs off of a computer, but it\\'s not like they\\'re hitting command P. That\\'s not how this works. Every single color. of the scarf is screen printed using its own mask, or basically a stencil. If your scarf has 20 colors, it has at least 20 masks that they then squeegee the ink over, and the precision is perfect.\\n\\nDavid: This is like EUV lithography.\\n\\nBen: Yes, I was looking at my wife\\'s twilly scarf, the little wrist or hair tie scarf that we got in Aix-en Provence. I don\\'t know how you do this by hand, and I don\\'t know how you do it by hand 20 times over and over and over for every single layer. If you\\'ve ever been to an Hermes store or you own one of these, you just can\\'t believe that this is done by hand without any of the layers being out of alignment. Because if any of them are out of alignment, you ruin the whole thing and you have to start over.\\n\\nIf that\\'s not enough, the masks are also hand etched by a craftsperson. Their entire job is to know how to translate a design into all the different color layers, which they then hand etch. The pipeline is designer, engraver, that\\'s an engraver of each mask, colorist, weaver, printer, and then someone to do the finishing.\\n\\nDavid: All of which are extremely hard to replicate and involve both extreme craftsmanship and extreme taste. The competitive barriers to the Hermes scarf, I think they\\'re way higher than the bags, honestly, even though the bags are a bigger business now.\\n\\nBen: The skills are completely non transferable. This process doesn\\'t really exist, certainly not at scale at any other company. Actually, I was talking to my wife about this. She brought up the idea that it\\'s like Disney imagineers or almost like Pixar employees, where you specialize in this one crazy little piece of the production process that no other company has your same production process. The attention to detail is so staggering that once you enter the Hermes universe, then you\\'re in that universe for the rest of your career because that is where your trade is still practiced.\\n\\nDavid: I think also, as a client too, at least in scarves, if you entered the Hermes scarf universe, you\\'re not buying any other scarves.\\n\\nBen: Totally, and you really like all the lore. Part of what makes Hermes Hermes at this point is their callbacks to their own history. They have a hundred and eighty seven years of history to call upon, and they do so over and over and over again. They remix and they name things after stores that used to exist at certain addresses. It\\'s a universe.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I remember growing up and my mom is half British. I\\'m a quarter British. To the Queen Elizabeth thing, my mom\\'s Hermes scarves were and are among her most treasured items. You\\'ll note all of this that\\'s happening, \\xa0Robert, the innovations, these new products, the art, the whimsy, he\\'s doing all this in the 1930s. This is the Great Depression era. This tells you about Hermes and Hermes clients. They are unaffected. They keep buying. This carries through right to this day. I don\\'t know that there is a more recession insulated business than Hermes.\\n\\nBen: You\\'re exactly right. Twelve months now after we did the LVMH episode, we\\'re finally on the tail end of this pandemic bubble of luxury, and we\\'re seeing a lot of these brands take a hit. Hermes is the most insulated of all the luxury brands, where they have the least cost sensitive clients.\\n\\nDavid: After this, there\\'s World War II. Famously, before the war, Hermes products came in cream colored boxes. Robert was very meticulous about the packaging that his crafted items and his art would come in, and it was cream. It had to be cream. During the war, there\\'s a shortage of packaging materials, they can\\'t get cream. The only color that is available to them in the quantities that they need is orange. That was designed for patisseries, for bakeries.\\n\\nBen: Is that what the orange ones were used for?\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s why there was an excess of it because it was used for bakeries, and bakeries weren\\'t baking as many croissants and pain au chocolat during the war, et cetera. There\\'s all this orange packing material. Robert embraces it, and the Hermes orange box is born. This is crazy. I didn\\'t know this till research. Hermes owns this color. You cannot get Hermes orange anywhere else. Pantone does not list it in their colors.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s interesting you say Hermes owns this color. You are correct that Hermes has selected a non Pantone color, but what Hermes tries to do is say, well, we own orange. We can\\'t be nailed down by a Pantone specific code, we own orange more broadly. They\\'ve actually gone head to head with the EU. This has gone to court where it\\'s been determined that no, you can\\'t own orange. You can\\'t just own all the oranges.\\n\\nDavid: Amazing.\\n\\nBen: What they\\'ve done is they\\'ve actually leaned into this, where there is a classic Hermes orange, but it presents differently on each of the leathers. They have 10 different leathers or something like that that they work with. When they die those leathers, it presents a little bit differently. They have this, sure, there\\'s a digital perfect representation of the color of classic orange, but there\\'s this whole spectrum of the way that it shows up on leather. They\\'ve even further winked at all of us by creating five or six other oranges.\\n\\nThey have Hermes fue, which is the fire. They have Hermes sanguine, which is this red hot orange like lava. Or they have the Hermes moutarde, which is their mustard. Each of these is a little bit of, I think it\\'s to continue to assert that we own the whole spectrum of oranges, but it\\'s definitely to be able to stay current, stay present, encapsulate the theme of a season, because every year they pick a theme, so they play with their oranges a little bit to evoke the whimsy that they want from this year\\'s theme.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. There\\'s this metal level or corporate level playfulness to this too, of we own all the oranges.\\n\\nBen: Totally. The Hermes oranges are almost to continue the Disney analogy. It\\'s almost like the people that go to the park and look for the hidden Mickeys. It\\'s a way to even more deeply participate in the Hermes universe.\\n\\nDavid: A few other things that Robert adds over the years, he adds the men\\'s silks métiers, aka ties. \\u200aThe legend behind that one is pretty great. Supposedly a number of gentlemen were refused entry to the casino, thus went to the neighboring Hermes shop next door, and said, can you take some of your beautiful silk scarves that cut and tailor them into ties for us so that we can enter the casino? I\\'m sure that\\'s apocryphal, but adds to the legend here.\\n\\nBen: They are these patterns. They\\'re just as intricate as the scarves. There\\'s less storytelling that happens in the tie. The scarves tend to be something you could frame, put on the wall, look at in 16 different ways, and the story behind it. When you look at it, you can\\'t believe that it was hand screen printed.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. After World War II, Robert decides that Hermes needs a logo. Taking inspiration from the 19th century painting, le Duc Attele, Groom a L\\'Attente, which means Hitched Carriage Waiting Groom, the famous Hermes logo is born. The logo is the callback to the carriage. It\\'s the nobility. I find it really interesting, especially at that point in time that Robert decided. You could imagine a galloping horse or something like that would be the appropriate logo.\\n\\nBen: No, it\\'s so genius.\\n\\nDavid: No, it\\'s the carriage.\\n\\nBen: Yes, it\\'s to intentionally ground the brand in history in something that they were a part of that is only theirs, because nobody else starting today is going to have that as a part of their history. They\\'re leaning into the thing that makes them unique, special. The almost defensible durable asset that they have is that they participated in that era that has a nostalgia about it.\\n\\nDavid: And no longer exists.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Horses in the equestrian world still exists. It\\'s obviously not what it once was, but it still exists. The carriage world is gone. It\\'s just a dream these days, and that\\'s what Robert is so good at, this dream. The other thing we have to talk about are the window displays. You referenced this a little bit earlier.\\n\\nHe hires first, Annie Beaumel, and then she\\'s soon joined by the legendary Leila Menchari. Specifically, these two women come from theater set design just to design the window displays at the Faubourg at the flagship store on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore. There are whole museum exhibits just dedicated to these window displays.\\n\\nIt\\'s not like, again, you walk by XYZ other store, even the most prestigious brands and it\\'s like the products are there. Here are the products, here\\'s the brand you\\'re buying, here\\'s the LV, et cetera. These displays, it\\'s a dream. There are probably some Hermes products in there, but it\\'s like a museum exhibit. It\\'s artwork.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and art is exactly the right way to put it. There is no utility to these displays. These displays, much like any advertising that you see of Hermes today, it\\'s not about the product, it\\'s about how you feel. I think this is an interesting place to revisit this idea that we talked about on the LVMH episode of luxury versus premium, where premium means you pay more and you get more utility out of a given product.\\n\\nI pay for a bigger storage space on my iPhone and I get more utility out of that. I can store more photos. Luxury means you pay more literally because it doesn\\'t create more utility. It is either more pleasing to you intrinsically for the feeling, or it\\'s an extrinsic signal where you are signaling to others that you have the means to spend on this item, even though it doesn\\'t provide more utility. It\\'s a despite rather than a because.\\n\\nArt does fall on this spectrum. Art is like luxury taken to its logical extreme. It has actually zero utility. A Birkin bag is a piece of art, but at least it also carries your stuff around. Luxury products are this interesting midpoint between extreme functionality but also artwork. When you buy an air mass product, you aren\\'t just buying the product, you\\'re buying a piece of art a piece of their heritage, a feeling that connects you to the maker and the place it was created.\\n\\nYou\\'re trying to buy a piece of Hermes\\' heritage and reputation, and hoping to adopt it as a part of you, as a part of your identity. You are seeking whether it\\'s conscious or not to let other people know about this too. You\\'re not necessarily trying to signal it to everyone, but you do want to signal it to the right people who would appreciate it.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s this genius aspect to what Hermes is doing and what Robert\\'s doing with the arts like these window displays. The Luxury Strategy book talks a lot about this. When you\\'re selling luxury items, they can\\'t just be art. They need to have some utility to them. You will never see any of these brands, Hermes included, become art galleries. They\\'re not selling paintings, but it\\'s critical for luxury brands to have a connection to the arts.\\n\\nI think you realize this before anybody of like, the windows in our stores are these portals into this world of dream and art. You\\'ll come in and you\\'ll buy a scarf that you\\'ll wear. You\\'ll buy a bag that you\\'ll use. Maybe you\\'ll buy a tie, maybe you\\'ll buy a wallet, homewares, furniture, or any of the other things over time that they sell. That will have utility, but it\\'s connected to this dream.\\n\\nBen: Yes, you\\'re taking a piece of that dream with you, and it\\'s almost a daily reminder of the dream that you\\'re now participating in. The key insight is that by adopting art as a critical piece of the bundle that is your product. It enables you as the seller to completely switch tracks to disconnect from any evaluation of value.\\n\\nDavid: Right, or features.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. You\\'re out of the feeds and speeds world. You are not being comped against, well, this other purse is much cheaper and serves the same function. Now, we have bundled in the function of the object and an unevaluatable...\\n\\nDavid: Priceless feeling.\\n\\nBen: A priceless feeling. Now, we can sell the goods for whatever we want, because it\\'s impossible to know the value of that second component that we\\'ve bundled in.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, totally. Speaking of dreams, we\\'re now in the 1950s in the post World War II era, the most amazing, unbelievable, fantastical dream of the 1950s happens to Hermes in real life. That dream is Princess Grace Kelly.\\n\\nI mentioned a little while back that one of the first things that Robert did when he came into the business was redesign the handbag and christen it the Sac a Depeches. It becomes popular, but we\\'re talking about leather goods, handbags, important, but that was the previous generation of the business. Now under Robert, it\\'s the scarves, it\\'s the dream, it\\'s all this stuff. Leather\\'s part of it, but a smaller part.\\n\\nIn 1956, Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco, this is a girl from Philadelphia, an American girl who goes on to become a movie star, who then goes on to become Princess Grace of Monaco. I can\\'t imagine a bigger dream for any woman or any person in the 1950s. She is photographed using the Sac a Depeches in Life magazine.\\n\\nBen: On the cover of Life magazine.\\n\\nDavid: The legend is that it was on the cover of Life magazine, but I googled a lot of 1956 covers of Life magazine, and I didn\\'t find it on the cover.\\n\\nBen: Interesting. Maybe that\\'s been played up over time.\\n\\nDavid: This might have become part of the lore. Regardless, big picture in Life magazine. She is clutching her beloved Sac a Depeches to her midsection.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s almost like as she\\'s exiting a building. It almost seems like it\\'s a paparazzi type photo.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s a paparazzi photo. Her husband, Prince Rainier of Monaco is holding the door behind her. It\\'s the most dreamlike thing you could imagine. It\\'s in black and white. The reason that she is clutching this fairly large bag, unbeknownst to the world at the time, is she\\'s trying to hide her pregnancy from the paparazzi. She\\'s pregnant with her first daughter.\\n\\nThis photo just becomes iconic. Everybody wants to be Grace Kelly. Everybody wants to have this bag. One of the last things that Robert does right before he retires in 1977 is he officially changes the product name of the Sac a Depeches to the Kelly bag. This is the birth of, I don\\'t even know what to call it. The Kelly and the Birkin are ends of ones, but these leather good products that transcend everything, that are so truly N of one. There\\'s no other way to describe them.\\n\\nBen: There is so much to say about these bags, how they\\'re crafted, the lore around them, and the supply, demand, and the econ 101. Before we get to that, this is the perfect time for another story about ServiceNow. ServiceNow is one of our big partners here on Season 14 and is really an incredible company.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. ServiceNow digitally transforms your enterprise, helping you automate processes, improve service delivery, and increase overall operational efficiency all in one platform. Over 85% of the Fortune 500 runs on them. Today, they are the 76th largest company in the world by market cap. That\\'s wild. They\\'re coming up on Hermes here.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. That story is really the story of their CEO, Bill McDermott. When he took over in 2019, the idea that this just 15-year-old company would be bigger than Nike or Pfizer soon was insane. ServiceNow was the leader in enterprise IT automation. But what Bill has done since, like we talk about all the time on the show, is evolve that product into a true solution for the entire enterprise.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. It\\'s just like our NVIDIA series. Moving from product to solution makes you an essential partner for your customers, which lets you build real enterprise value. Bill is the best in the world at this.\\n\\nBen: Bill\\'s story is great. He started his career at age 17 in a very different business. He bought his local corner deli in working class Long Island.\\n\\nDavid: As a high schooler. This is amazing. He buys the deli for $7000 in seller financing from the owner who is retiring. Bill realized that the kids like him who hung out at the store weren\\'t coming there for the product. Sure, they wanted food, but it wasn\\'t about the sandwiches. It was about hanging out with your friends. That was the solution.\\n\\nThis was the 1970s, Bill starts installing arcade cabinets, Pac-Man, Space Invaders, everything we talked about on our Atari and Nintendo episodes. Guess what, kids spend way more time there, and Bill makes way more profits than just selling sandwiches.\\n\\nDavid: He literally made life changing money from this deli. He buys his parents a beach house.\\n\\nBen: After college, Bill joins the tech world in sales, rises through the ranks at Xerox, and eventually becomes CEO of SAP. But he\\'s always bringing that mindset. Why are my customers really here? When he joined ServiceNow in 2019, he takes them from, oh, you can make it function better, to you can digitally transform my entire company.\\n\\nDavid: The company\\'s performance since then has been incredible. Honestly, it\\'s like Hermes over the past couple of years. Revenue has doubled, earnings have nearly 10x\\'d since 2019. Bill and ServiceNow have entered the conversation with the NVIDIAs, the Microsofts, as the most important technology partners for enterprises around the globe.\\n\\nBen: If you want to learn more about the ServiceNow platform and see how it can transform your business, go over to servicenow.com/acquired or click the link in the show notes. When you get in touch, just tell them Ben and David sent you. Okay, David, Life magazine, the Kelly bag. It\\'s out. This thing must sell like hotcakes, right?\\n\\nDavid: Yes and no. Certainly, this plays right into this whole dream thing that we\\'ve been talking about and burnishes Hermes\\' already incredible brand and image. My god, Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco is carrying this bag, not just carrying this bag, but it\\'s her favorite bag, the closest thing to her body. But we\\'re still in the fifties here, so yes, it becomes incredibly popular.\\n\\nYes, I\\'m pretty sure it becomes Hermes\\'s biggest selling bag, but the market isn\\'t quite there yet in the way that it is today with the Birkins and the Kellys. The global rich isn\\'t that big of a population. I\\'m sure they\\'re all buying Kellys, but Robert probably knows all of these clients personally at this point. We\\'re not anywhere near the scale that we\\'re talking about today.\\n\\nBen: To your point, I keep saying it\\'s launched. It\\'s not really launch, they just rebrand to the Kelly bag. When the Kelly bag is formally launched, it\\'s really expensive. It\\'s a $900 handbag in the 50s, which today is $10,000-$12,000, approximately the price of a Kelly bag today. It comes out that as this thing that is completely ridiculous and inaccessible price wise, the people who are buying it are the Grace Kellys of the world, and there\\'s not really this stratified class below that that\\'s got this huge amount of purchasing power.\\n\\nDavid: Right. The number of people who could spend the equivalent of $12,000 on a bag back then was just much, much, much smaller than it is today.\\n\\nBen: Yup, exactly. No, handbags do not immediately become a huge part of the business or I should say the dominant whatever it is today, six or seven times larger than silk part of the business right away.\\n\\nDavid: In fact, actually, sadly, quite the opposite happens. As we head through the 60s and into the 1970s and the end of Robert\\'s tenure and his generation as the head of Hermes, the company starts to fall on hard times.\\n\\nBen: Which is crazy to say. I remember this moment in the Porsche episode, you\\'re like, no, come on, Porsche skinnied down the entire lineup to only making the 911 because they couldn\\'t justify any of the other products, and the whole company was a freaking mess. Hermes is not quite in those dire of straits, but they have the ingredients of Hermes that we know today. They\\'ve got the Kelly bag, they\\'ve got the orange box. They\\'ve adopted the logo.\\n\\nDavid: They\\'ve got the scarves.\\n\\nBen: They\\'ve got the scarves. They have these small workshops where they make everything, but it\\'s not working yet.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s particularly not working because like we just talked about, that market was not that big yet. As we entered the 1970s, something really funny happens. The next generation rejects that dream. This is you and me, our parents\\' generation, the hippies, the 1970s. This is democratization. Little girls don\\'t want to be Grace Kelly anymore. They want to be Stevie Nicks or something like that.\\n\\nThe dream of Hermes that was once so elegant and so desired by so many people but inaccessible, it certainly still got its audience, but it\\'s not as universal. This is when so many of the other what we now think of as luxury brands really start to come up. We talked about this on the LVMH episode, but they\\'re connected to fashion. It\\'s first Dior, and then it\\'s Yves Saint Laurent. This is the Mondrian dress from Yves Saint Laurent. This is the revolution. It\\'s Gucci. It\\'s Chanel in the 80s when Karl Lagerfeld takes over. What they\\'re selling is very, very, very different than what Hermes is selling.\\n\\nBen: This is an important distinction between Hermes and all the brands you just named. They come from the world of couture, of fashion, and of cutting edge, in your face, risky art. Mind you, by this point, they\\'re already 120 years old, 130 years old. They come from the world of leather, horses, durable goods that stand the test of time, and frankly, styles that stand the test of time. It\\'s not how creative and crazy we can be, they talk about it as responsible growth.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the smallest amount that we can move from our current compass in order to do what our clientele wants while staying true to our roots? It\\'s a rejection of risk and an almost embrace of history. It\\'s super different than most other luxury brands, which as you point out come from fashion.\\n\\nDavid: Right, and those brands are getting born or reborn right there in the 1970s.\\n\\nBen: Yes. David, this is probably a good time to share who we chatted with in preparation from this episode and his observation about Hermes.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This was super cool. One of the things that for me and for both of us just blows our mind as Acquired grows. We got to talk with Domenico De Sole, who was CEO of Gucci, during the fight with Bernard Arnault that we chronicled. Really, I think that was the best part of our LVMH episode.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely. When Domenico De Sole, Tom Ford, and that team rejected Bernard\\'s takeover and managed to not become a part of LVMH. Obviously, then Domenico and Tom Ford left to start Tom Ford after that.\\n\\nDavid: It was super cool. We talked to Domenico. He comes from that world. Even with the heritage of Gucci, he and Tom, it was fashion first in his perspective. I think the perspective of many folks that are coming out of this 70s, 80s era of luxury, that\\'s what\\'s interesting. That\\'s what\\'s fresh.\\n\\nBen: Risk on, baby.\\n\\nDavid: Risk on, yeah.\\n\\nBen: Let\\'s figure out how to break some glass in what we\\'re doing.\\n\\nDavid: Grace Kelly is not breaking any glass.\\n\\nBen: Right. That Domenico helped us understand about Hermes is they have been so protective of their brand and this unbelievable steward. They\\'re so careful at how they\\'ve chosen to deploy the brand. They make sure that the mystique is always there. They don\\'t violate the promise. They never cut corners.\\n\\nThey have been above board in their brand promise and keeping that promise with customers for over a hundred years. That is a strength and a weakness. It\\'s a strength as long as you learn how to employ it as a strength. In the world of fashion, it\\'s butting heads.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, it\\'s antithetical to fashion.\\n\\nBen: Yes, exactly.\\n\\nDavid: All this culminates towards the end of the 1970s as Robert is nearing the end of his tenure at Hermès and the end of his life. Sadly, there\\'s a moment. This is in probably 1977 or so, where they bring in consultants and the consultants recommend like, hey, you guys should probably do what Gucci is doing. You should probably close the atelier above the shop at the Faubourg, you should probably outsource production, and you should probably increase your number of products, your SKUs, have lower prices, and have them be more accessible.\\n\\nBen: Unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: That was the accepted wisdom at the time. I don\\'t know if it was McKinsey or who was saying that.\\n\\nBen: Today, I will tell you that Hermes has a corporate policy of no consultants, and now I know where that came from.\\n\\nDavid: This is enshrined in the luxury strategy is anti law of marketing number 19, do not hire consultants.\\n\\nBen: Wow. The recommendation was to come in and destroy everything that makes you special and follow the playbook that everyone else is running.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. It\\'s working for them, and it\\'s not working for Hermes.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s crazy.\\n\\nDavid: This is when the next generation transition happens to Robert\\'s son, Jean-Louis Dumas. I can\\'t believe it with this family. Every time they come in at a generational transfer, and the company and the brand is under existential threat, even though we think of Hermes as the most unassailable thing in the world right now, but finds itself at a moment where it can be assailed. There\\'s a generational transfer happening. You would think this is the downward spiral. This is the dropping of the baton, and the next generation always rallies.\\n\\nBen: Isn\\'t it amazing? You would think the best person out there to brilliantly come up with both the business strategy and the creative element is probably not your direct descendant.\\n\\nDavid: Right, probably not your nepotistic family member.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s not the best search process to run, and yet it works. I don\\'t think it\\'s this magical bloodline. I think it is a deep understanding of the tradition of the business, of exactly what type of chutzpah the team has to rally and take on, having the political clout to find the right people, and empower them to make the change, to have a sixth sense for where you sit in the marketplace versus competitors and what people may want out of your brand next. It\\'s all the intangibles that come from growing up in the business make you able to be the right person to transform it.\\n\\nDavid: I really do think that there is an element too of the successive generations, they apprentice in the ateliers with their hands. I think there is an element of that. They also apprentice, especially these days on the business side too. Axel talks, all the time, about dinner table conversations between his uncle, Jean-Louis, who we\\'re about to talk about now, who is the fifth generation CEO of Hermes and his mother, who was head of production at the dinner table growing up. You can\\'t not absorb that.\\n\\nI think that\\'s the flip side of nepotism, which makes it such a challenging topic. On the one hand, obviously limiting the universe of talent. On the other hand, how do you replicate those dinner table conversations?\\n\\nBen: It\\'s funny. I called it a sixth sense. I think the right way to describe it is actually a je ne sais quoi about what you absorb from those.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Okay, Jean-Louis, the fifth generation. The consultants are saying, hey, go be like Gucci.\\n\\nBen: Shut down your shop, where they still today make Birkin and Kelly bags by hand one artisan at a time in the most famous address in all of luxury and fashion. Not so.\\n\\nDavid: I do have to correct you there. That is not specifically true. It\\'s certainly spiritually true. I believe now, the only products that are made in the Faubourg are saddles. I think everything else is made in Pantin, which is a 20-minute drive away. It\\'s not like the outsourced production. Anyway, we\\'ll get to that.\\n\\nBen: Great.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, Jean-Louis comes in.\\n\\nBen: What year is this?\\n\\nDavid: 1978.\\n\\nBen: Great.\\n\\nDavid: He, like all the generations before and after him, come up. He apprenticed in the business. He knows how to do the saddle stitch. It\\'s in his hands, it\\'s in his soul.\\n\\nBen: We\\'ve talked too many times without actually talking about the saddle stitch. It\\'s time to actually talk about saddle stitching. Listeners, you might be wondering, why do they keep saying this? What does it mean? Saddle stitching is an amazing technique that Hermes uses for every single bag that they make. I can\\'t tell if this is true or not. It can either only be done by hand, or until recently only be done by hand, but it is a far more effective, high quality, and durable form of stitching relative to the typical machine sewn stitching that you\\'re thinking about right now, where the same thread goes through one needle and it goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s also incredibly beautiful. It\\'s got a slight diagonal valence to it as opposed to the normal straight line stitching.\\n\\nBen: Yes. How does it work? There\\'s something called a horse that goes between your legs. The horse holds two pieces of leather together. The whole point of the saddle stitch is to sew two pieces of leather together. You first punch little holes in the leather using likely a pricking iron as your method of doing this. If you\\'re good, you don\\'t prick all the way through. You just poke a little hole with your pricking iron or all part way through, so that way you don\\'t poke too big of a hole. You only end up pushing exactly a hole the size of your needle and thread through.\\n\\nYou can always tell. If you\\'re looking at something and it\\'s stitched, there are these big freaking holes, then there\\'s this thin thread that\\'s moving through, and there\\'s space between the thread and the leather, you know what kind of craftsmanship went into that. If it almost looks like the stitch vanishes into the leather and you\\'re like, is there even a hole there, it\\'s hard to even see how this was done, that is a saddle stitch. You take your pricking iron or your awl, you poke the partial hole. There\\'s a lot of muscle memory involved in this. You then pass one needle through going from the right to the left side, and then you have a second needle...\\n\\nDavid: On the other end of the thread, so one thread two needles.\\n\\nBen: Yes, that you pass through the other direction. What you\\'ve done as you pull both of them through is created this incredibly strong interlocking mechanism.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s tensile force going in both directions.\\n\\nBen: Yes. If it gets ripped, you\\'re not at risk of the whole thing pulling out, your saddle, or your bag falling apart. You just lose that one stitch, and that one stitch can be repaired. The only way for you to unravel something that is saddle stitched together is to individually go through and cut every single stitch.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, compare that to most products that you own.\\n\\nBen: Yes, this literally provides high utility if you\\'re in an equestrian jumping competition or if your bag needs to hold something that really needs a lot of protection and can\\'t fall through. It\\'s almost like it started with real necessary utility, because something life threatening could happen. Now it\\'s just massively overkill for everything that is saddle stitch, but you appreciate the craft behind it. There are very few people who are in a life or death circumstance that are dependent on their stitch holding true.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'m going to channel my inner Pierre-Alexis here, the current artistic director of Hermès. I think it still has relevance if you want your object to be permanent. If you want an object that you own to represent something wholly different and antithetical to the Amazonification or the Walmartification of items these days, you want it to be made like this.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Something that made this really special for hundreds of years, if not still, is that it had to be done by hand. If you want something of this quality, this gets this interesting idea, is handmade stuff better? Not necessarily. Axel even says this in an interview. He says in 2019, today, hand stitching is the highest quality, so machines are non negotiable. When the quality of a machine stitching gets better than hand stitching, we will do it. We are not a museum.\\n\\nDavid, this is where you\\'re getting your, we are not a museum quote from. But it really gets to this element of, why are handcrafted goods desirable? In this case, it literally creates something higher quality, more durable, certainly more aesthetically pleasing, since when done well, you can\\'t see that hole in between the thread and the leather. It\\'s a pretty special process.\\n\\nFor everyone who\\'s wondering, okay, but what is the rest of creating one of these bags look like, start to finish, a Kelly bag, and we\\'ll talk about working in a little bit but similar story, is made by one craftsman. One craftsman starts with 36 unique pieces of high quality leather.\\n\\nDavid: As much as possible from the same animal and matched exactly.\\n\\nBen: Yes, exactly. It\\'s not sourced from all these different places all over the world, one person is responsible for the bottoms, and someone else is responsible for the straps. It is one craftsman that takes these 36 cuts and stitches it together. It takes 20 hours. This is over the course of a few weeks to create this. One person assembling it all, putting the fasteners on it, stitching it. This takes two years to learn how to do before you are allowed to create one for the first time.\\n\\nDavid: I think it\\'s even more than that. It\\'s two years of training to become a Hermes artisan, period. I don\\'t think you\\'re allowed to touch the Birkins and the Kellys when you start day one on the job. I believe you need at least another three years, if not more, before you\\'re allowed to touch the Birkins and the Kellys.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating. This knowledge is passed from generation to generation. Hermes refers to this as the savoir faire or the know how or the expertise about the materials and the exceptional technique that\\'s transmitted from one craftsperson to another.\\n\\nDavid: Hang on to this. I have a lot more to say when we get to the current generation about this.\\n\\nBen: I\\'ll stop after this, but I thought this was pretty funny. Have you read the annual report, the 600-page document that they release once a year?\\n\\nDavid: I have to admit, I have not read it cover to cover.\\n\\nBen: You did more of the history, and I did more of this.\\n\\nDavid: But I\\'ve read large sections of it.\\n\\nBen: I was reading it. I found myself laughing at how often savoir faire was used in the prose. Every other paragraph, they just throw in a savoir faire, 133 times savoir faire is referenced in the Hermes registration document.\\n\\nDavid: Partially in their defense, savoir faire literally translates as know how. It\\'s a proper term in French.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, fair. I think the takeaway is real that this knowledge is transmitted from one generation to the other in the very same way that it was from father to son all the way back at the founding of the company. That is how they scale production. I will put a pin in that and come back to it later.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. The true genius of the current generation is they have scaled that to 7000 people.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s unbelievable.\\n\\nDavid: Unbelievable. I was going to talk about this towards the end of the Jean-Louis era, but I want to say it now because I think it\\'s perfect. I got to talk to a woman named Beatrice Amblard, who lives here in San Francisco.\\n\\nThis is amazing. She was an artisan at Hermes in Paris. She was hired right at the start of Jean-Louis\\'s tenure. She worked in the atelier at the Faubourg when Jean-Louis\\'s son, Pierre-Alexis, current artistic director, came to train after school as a teenager. He sat next to Beatrice, and I got to chat with her about this.\\n\\nBen: She runs April in Paris in San Francisco?\\n\\nDavid: She moved to San Francisco when Hermes opened the San Francisco store here. I was like, oh, you transitioned to the front of the house. She was like, no, no, no. I was the person for the West Coast who repaired everything for North American West Coast clients. There was one person in New York, and I was in San Francisco. We came from the Faubourg, and a few of these people go around the world.\\n\\nOne of the things about Hermes and actually Jean-Louis who said that the true essence of luxury and the true essence of Hermes is everything they make can be repaired. If you buy an item from Hermes, no matter what it is, they will repair it.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, I think that\\'s true.\\n\\nDavid: Even if it\\'s 100 years old, you bring it in, they will repair it.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, that\\'s true. This is flashing forward to today, 15 dedicated repair shops worldwide, and they mend 120,000 pieces a year.\\n\\nDavid: Wow, amazing. I asked Beatrice when I was talking to her, what was this like? What was special? She said, look, you have to understand, when I was training as a young person and decided I wanted to go into this field, Hermes was absolutely the greatest company that anyone could hope to work for. It wasn\\'t even close. There was no comparison.\\n\\nBen: What years?\\n\\nDavid: This was in the late 80s, early 90s. She said, look, I decided that either I was going to get a job at Hermes, or I was going to leave this industry and go do something else. It is in that high of a steam. I said, oh, well, why? She said, look, by the time we\\'re at this era, nobody else was left that did this.\\n\\nEverything we talked about in the 1970s, all these other brands all went in this complete other direction. The consultants were telling Hermes to go in that direction too, but they\\'re the last one standing that did all of this by hand in the tradition handed down through hundreds of years. If that\\'s important to you, there\\'s no place else. You can\\'t ply your trade doing that anywhere else.\\n\\nI asked her then. I was like, okay, well, as for the products and to the clients, to the customers, why does that make a difference? What she said is what you\\'ll hear the family talk about all the time. She said, look, it\\'s about soul. This product has a soul. Somebody made that thing with their bare hands. That means something. There\\'s nobody else, certainly at Hermes at scale, that does that.\\n\\nShe ended up leaving Hermes and starting her own boutique here in San Francisco, April in Paris, and she actually also runs her own leather school here in San Francisco too to train artisans. You can get custom stuff, small boutique stuff. Beatrice is a worldwide master, you can get that from her. But the idea that a $200 billion company at scale would be doing this. There\\'s nobody else.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, it\\'s nuts. It\\'s completely insane. The people who don\\'t work for Hermes, your options are in the dozens. If you go as a customer and you want something like a saddle stitched bag, wallet, or something like Hermes would make in that traditional pre war, early 20th century fashion, there aren\\'t that many other artisans out there. Hermes employs 7000 of them. I don\\'t know how many other ones there are, 1000, 2000.\\n\\nIt\\'s not like Hermes has cornered the market. They\\'re hiring more people and training them as fast as they can. They\\'re trying to preserve this market that otherwise would have entirely been zero. It\\'s a pretty crazy thing that they\\'ve managed to scale even to the scale that they\\'re at.\\n\\nDavid: The other thing Beatrice said to bring it back to Jean-Louis, he is a legend. He really cared. The idea that he would follow the consultants, it was just so completely anathema to him. He\\'s the artistic director and CEO of the company. She ran into him in the elevator in the Faubourg right after she started. He looks at her and said, you\\'re Beatrice Amblard, welcome to Hermes. He knew everybody by name.\\n\\nWhen she ended up leaving in 1997 to open her own store, he called her. He was genuinely shocked. Nobody ever leaves. What are you going to do? She explained that she wanted to be entrepreneurial, start her own thing. Shortly after the San Francisco Chronicle did an article about her, he found the article, read it in France, cut it out, and mailed it to her with a note of congratulations handwritten.\\n\\nBen: It doesn\\'t cost me anything to do that. On the one hand, you just say they\\'re being a kind person and gave so much to your house for so long.\\n\\nDavid: On the other hand, this is the CEO of Hermes.\\n\\nBen: Right. I think it\\'s important to realize, these individual craftsmen are entirely non competitive with Hermes. It\\'s a completely different value proposition to the customer. When you\\'re buying Hermes today, you don\\'t start from a place of, you know, I think I want some of the very best sewn leather goods I can find. Let me evaluate the whole landscape of people who could deliver that for me, and then I\\'ll decide which maker to go with.\\n\\nEither A, you\\'re doing that, and you are a person who knows about a bunch of individual leather craftsmen, which is rare. Or B, you actually just want to buy something from Hermes, and there\\'s not any evaluation going on. Maybe there is between big luxury brands, but probably not, the value proposition is not you have a need for a leather good, and you can bake off all the competitors. It\\'s you either want something from Hermes, or you\\'re a different type of customer.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Okay, Jean-Louis story. How did he turn this thing around and save Hermes from the consultants? Like we said, he\\'d apprenticed just like every other generation. But unlike any other generation, or I guess maybe like Emile back in the day going and meeting Henry Ford, he comes to America. Specifically, he came to America to follow his wife, Rena, who became a world famous architect. Rena was interning with IM Pei in New York.\\n\\nBen: Really?\\n\\nDavid: Rena Dumas would go on to design all the stores that they opened up all around the world and design the atelier in Pantin when they expand production.\\n\\nBen: IM Pei, famous from a number of things, including previous acquired episode with Michael Ovitz, designed the CAA building in Los Angeles designed the Louvre Pyramid.\\n\\nDavid: I was going to say. Think about the connections here in France and Paris.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. By the way, everyone in Paris thought the pyramid was hideously ugly at first relative to this 1700s building around it. Over time now, it\\'s become this iconic triangle pyramid, beautiful signature of the city.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Jean-Louis, when he\\'s in America, he works for Bloomingdale\\'s. Bloomingdale\\'s, my god, of all places.\\n\\nBen: There was a heyday of department stores. In fact, if you go way back, do you know how Hermes entered the United States?\\n\\nDavid: In partnership with Neiman Marcus?\\n\\nBen: Yes, 1930s. Good. Wow, you did find that.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s hard to stop me, but you do it sometimes.\\n\\nBen: Okay, Bloomingdale\\'s.\\n\\nDavid: From that experience being in America, being in this much more mainstream audience, he comes to understand what these other brands are doing, what the consultants are suggesting, but he takes that back. He says, look, the way forward is we\\'re going to figure out how to make Hermes relevant. We\\'re not going to throw away everything we\\'ve done. We\\'re going to keep our tradition, we\\'re going to keep our craftsmanship, we\\'re going to keep our market position. But our clients want to be like these young people, particularly these young women. The moms don\\'t want to be like their moms, they want to be like their daughters.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s a tall order to figure out how to revitalize, rejuvenate, and make Hermes relevant for this new era with this new audience.\\n\\nDavid: With the same products. This is key.\\n\\nBen: Right. Keeping the same products and not violating everything that Hermes currently stands for. We talked about this on LVMH, the Not Your Mother\\'s Tiffany campaign. It\\'s almost like, how do you not insult your current customer base by adapting for the next one?\\n\\nDavid: This is such a tight needle to thread to use a pun here. They need to run the Not Your Mother\\'s Tiffany campaign without actually running the Not Your Mother\\'s Tiffany campaign.\\n\\nBen: Right.\\n\\nDavid: The first thing, in 1979, the first year he takes over, he launches a new ad campaign in Paris with young Parisian women wearing the iconic Hermes scarves. Remember, that\\'s the main part of the business at this point in time, but it\\'s all these old people who want to be like Queen Elizabeth wearing the scarves. Young women wearing the scarves, not how you would typically wear a scarf, different parts all over their body. It\\'s the Hermes version of Not Your Mother\\'s Tiffany.\\n\\nMost importantly, they\\'re wearing these scarves with jeans. Grace Kelly would never wear jeans. I don\\'t know if she ever did wear jeans, but she sure as hell wouldn\\'t be photographed wearing jeans.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: These ads are the scarves the Queen Elizabeth is wearing with jeans and in fun, interesting ways, playful ways to wear the scarves, but they\\'re still the same scarves.\\n\\nBen: Fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: This is a revolution. The rest of the family is really upset about it, but he pushes it through. You can still see echoes of this to this day. A big part of Hermes fashion and probably the biggest part of I think the scarf fashion these days is tying the scarves on your bags, on your accessories, on various parts of your body. Not wearing them like your mother wore them.\\n\\nBen: This is how they\\'ve adapted for the digital era too. They\\'ve come out with five or six different apps to try to figure out how we engage people in the mobile era. One of the ideas that they had was this app that basically gives you suggestions and all the different ways you could tie a scarf.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s super cool. I think this is brilliant, because this is allowing Hermes to exist and be relevant alongside fashion without actually getting into fashion themselves. The scarves and then ultimately the bags, can be the accessories to your jeans, to your fashion to your—we\\'re past the era of bell bottoms. but the spiritual equivalent of bell bottoms here. They can say something about you, but they\\'re still the same products that they always were.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s pretty interesting if you can figure out how to coexist alongside cool, fashionable new cutting edge things. Then you deserve a place in someone\\'s lineup where they say, well, I both am embracing a current trend, but I\\'m also respectful of the past. I also found my own way to weave this high class, high status thing into the rest of my image. I think that especially at their price points, they\\'re serving someone who wants to raise one hand and say, I look cool and raise the other hand and say...\\n\\nDavid: I\\'m classic.\\n\\nBen: I\\'m classic, and I have the money to spend on things that are very price anchored. Everyone knows what a Kelly bag costs. It\\'s gone up a little bit, but Hermes has very high price point products that stay approximately that price forever.\\n\\nDavid: Jean-Louis has a quote about this, which is very French. He says, \"The young customers came to us more than we went to them. People saw again, but with a new eye, the beauty of materials worked by fine hands. They came, we followed.\" That\\'s the most French way of ever saying this, but this is what we\\'re talking about. He got their client base and often the young people\\'s parents who wanted to be more like the young people here to see with new eyes the same things. Total genius.\\n\\nBen: Yup, for sure. Okay, that\\'s brilliant.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s on the product side and doing this jiu jitsu to reposition the products in Hermes. The other thing that he did, which was huge was he had the very same realization that Henry Racamier had at Louis Vuitton, and we foreshadowed this earlier. What Racamier figured out at Louis Vuitton in the 1970s was that the market now, the global wealthy, the global elite, the global rich, is so much bigger now than it was in the 1950s. The number of people with wealth on the order of Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier of Monaco, or even a few rungs below them, but the number of people who can be in our client base around the world is just so, so, so much larger than it used to be.\\n\\nBen: And it\\'s happening in this country by country way, which is perfect for a brand like this. They can go to America, and then they will observe the rise of Japan, and then they\\'ll go to japan in the 90s and 2000s. Then they\\'ll observe the rising upper middle class of China, so they\\'ll go there and present day. They can really position themselves as the second mover, where they can watch and see when this wealth class exists somewhere, then set up shop, and say, hey, France\\'s whole heritage is now available to you to adopt as part of your persona.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, and this is super key. I think to this day, it\\'s a huge part of the defensibility of Hermes and Louis Vuitton too. No matter where you live in the world and no matter what your cultural background is, when you attain this status, there\\'s still something about this connection to French and European nobility that you cannot buy from a brand from any other country.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s super fascinating that French nobility, fashion, and heritage is universally revered everywhere. Italian is too. I would say European generally, but French specifically, has an ability to do this in any geography as it develops.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. All of this stew comes together in 1984 with Jean-Louis\\'s greatest achievement. Unlike the Kelly bag, which again was an accident, yes, it was his father Robert and incredible genius, and then repositioning and renaming the bag, the Kelly bag. Jean Louis, this is literally whole cloth conceived of by him, was on a flight from Paris to London in the early 1980s, where he\\'s seated next to the French and British actress, Jane Birkin.\\n\\nBen: The It Girl of the time.\\n\\nDavid: Here\\'s what\\'s really interesting. I bet 95% plus of people listening to this right now have no idea who Jane Birkin was.\\n\\nBen: Which is so funny because in interviews with her, as the Birkin bag was blowing up or at least getting a lot of attention, an interviewer joked that she was going to be more famous for the bag than for her acting career, her modeling, and all that. She laughed and said, wouldn\\'t that be something?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, right.\\n\\nBen: Totally, 95%, if not more of the listeners to this podcast will have no idea who Jane Birkin is before this episode.\\n\\nDavid: But you definitely know the Birkin bag.\\n\\nBen: Yup, or at least you know of the Birkin bag. I\\'d bet 7 out of 10, maybe 8 out of 10 people listening to this couldn\\'t spot it. But if you say a Birkin bag, you know that it\\'s unattainably expensive, high status, hard to get handbag.\\n\\nDavid: Certainly if you follow the Hermes stock, you know what a Birkin bag is, even if you probably couldn\\'t pick it out of a crowd.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: Anyway, this is the culmination of everything we\\'ve been talking about. Who is Jane Birkin? She was British. She was born in England, but she moved to France and became a French citizen, and she became a French cultural icon. Again, the tie to France is so important here too.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t talk about this with Grace Kelly either. Grace Kelly was an American from Philadelphia, but she became the princess of Monaco. These two women, these two personas that are embodied in Hermes, Hermes doesn\\'t do celebrity advertising. I think it\\'s so important that even though neither of them were French, they became so deeply European and what they represented.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, that\\'s a great way to put it.\\n\\nDavid: For Jane Birkin, she was this next generation. She was an actress, both in film and theater. She was a singer. She was incredibly beautiful. She was the It girl, but in a very, very different way than Grace Kelly, she wore jeans. In particular, she had a trademark accessory fitting with the 1970s.\\n\\nBen: The basket?\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Counterculture, back to the land type ethos. She carried a wicker basket with her everywhere that she went.\\n\\nBen: Which has an ethos to it, but doesn\\'t lend itself well to overhead bins.\\n\\nDavid: No, it does not. As the two of them, Jean-Louis, CEO and Artistic Director of Hermès and Jane Birkin, French cultural icon, are boarding this flight to London, they\\'re seated next to each other, and Jane is struggling to get her fixed handle wicker basket up into the overhead compartment. At this point, Jane had become a mother and had kids. She had kid stuff in her basket.\\n\\nBen: She had baby bottles that were spilling out.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. I carry a lot of kid stuff these days. You need a lot of stuff with the kids.\\n\\nBen: By the way, how crazy is it that the Kelly bag was to hide a pregnancy, and the Birkin bag was designed to carry baby bottles?\\n\\nDavid: Baby forward, yes. I get it. On the one hand, this is esoteric Birkin lore. On the other hand, I think this is super important to Jean-Louis. Imagine the older generation Hermes embracing this.\\n\\nBen: You know what we should do? We should come out with a $15,000 diaper bag.\\n\\nDavid: Right. They sit down and they start talking on the flight. Jean-Louis introduces himself. He\\'s like, I noticed you\\'re struggling with your wicker basket there Miss Birkin.\\n\\nBen: And she doesn\\'t know who he is at first. It\\'s the funniest thing.\\n\\nDavid: Right.\\n\\nBen: She says something like, well, yeah, wouldn\\'t that be great if there was a bigger bag that actually closed? But Hermes doesn\\'t make that, or she made some comment. He goes, I am Hermes.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. The legend now. Who knows if this is true? She said, well, when Hermes makes a diaper bag, I\\'ll use that one.\\n\\nBen: Specifically for her, she fancies herself someone that has a lot of stuff and wants to bring all my stuff with me, so I just need a big bag, and it needs to close easily. Fashion be damned, I just need a huge freaking tote.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. As they get to talking, they\\'re talking about the Kelly. She\\'s like, look, Kelly\\'s the Kelly, but I can\\'t wear it over my shoulder. Jean-Louis starts sketching out designs on the plane, and voila. The Birkin is born.\\n\\nLarger than the Kelly, but smaller than the old original Hermès bag. It\\'s a tote bag, and it has two handles unlike the Kelly, which has one handle, and so with two handles. You can put it over your shoulder. It\\'s the—it feels weird to say more casual version of the Kelly, given that it\\'s the Birkin bag, but it is. It\\'s the more casual modern version of the Kelly.\\n\\nBen: The Kelly has cleaner lines and this beautiful, almost mid century trapezoidal shape, whereas the Birkin, everything about it screams function.\\n\\nDavid: Here\\'s what\\'s interesting. They released the product in 1984, and it is not an immediate success. I think part of this is that the Hermes brand transformation modernization was probably still underway. When you watch interviews with particularly, Pierre-Alexis, he\\'ll talk about this. He\\'s like, any other company would have given up on this product. But it takes about five years before the Birkin bag becomes the Birkin bag. The time is right. We\\'re in the 1980s, the go-go years. These are the years that are shaping Bernard Arnault here.\\n\\nBen: There are tons of American wealth being created. People are looking to be a little bit flashier. Now, granted Hermes is the least flashy of the luxury labels you could adopt, but people know the brand.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. It takes five years for it to become any modicum of success for Hermès. A lot of these things, this just slow burn starts that grows, and grows, and grows, and grows.\\n\\nBen: There\\'s a real lore around it that it\\'s hard to get. It\\'s just like with a kid. If you tell them they can\\'t have something, they wanted a lot more. If you tell your very fancy clientele that you would love to be able to get something for them, there\\'s just not enough.\\n\\nWe don\\'t have it today, but gosh, if you are a great customer of ours and we maintain a relationship with you, let me write down your number. I feel like we may just have something for you soon. It could be a few years, but I\\'ll reach out as soon as we have something. You\\'re an important customer of ours. If you want to show us you\\'re an even more important customer, please do by all means. And I\\'ll see what I can do.\\n\\nDavid: Ben, you would make a great Hermes essay.\\n\\nBen: I don\\'t think so. I actually had a wonderful Hermes associate that I worked with in the Aix-en-Provence store. It was crazy. We bought basically the most entry level Hermes products that you can buy in one of their stores. I think perfumes are sold in department stores and makeup. There are some more accessible things, but in terms of the durable goods, it started at the bottom.\\n\\nI had a delightful time and decided to buy something. I think we spent an hour and a half, and I had the most wonderful service and built an almost friendship with the associate who helped us through the whole process, spending as much time with me as they spent with someone coming in to pick up their Birkin bag. It was crazy, probably the best customer service I\\'ve ever received in any retail establishment anywhere. No, I don\\'t think I would be a good Hermes sales associate relative to where the bar has been set.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s funny. My experience was different. Of course, I had to go do some research for this episode.\\n\\nBen: You drove down to the Palo Alto store, right?\\n\\nDavid: Yes, I went to the Palo Alto store. I had to be down there anyway for some meetings. The sales associate who ultimately helped me is equally wonderful woman. I had a great experience. Her name is Susan. I\\'m going back to see her tomorrow as Valentine\\'s Day and Jenny\\'s birthday is coming up. I walked in the store with the intention of buying what I ultimately did buy, which is...\\n\\nBen: Apple watch band. I thought that\\'s what that was.\\n\\nDavid: An Apple watch band, yup. We\\'ll get to the Apple partnership in a little bit. I was passed around between a few different people in the store until ultimately, Susan helped me out. She was great. I think she actually might be a higher level essay. But when I expressed that I was there to buy an Apple Watch, Ben...\\n\\nBen: Interesting.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. I don\\'t know if that was just the day in the store or if that is part of the policy.\\n\\nBen: I have to imagine it\\'s a little bit different experience in the French countryside as compared to...\\n\\nDavid: The Stanford shopping center.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, I can see that. Back to the Birkin bag, by 2001, it becomes so widely known that there is a waiting list, an almost secret shrouded in mystery waiting list to get one of these things, that it is the main storyline of a Sex and the City episode. Samantha figures out that there\\'s a way to jump the five-year waitlist.\\n\\nDavid: The scene where she walks in to try and buy it is just iconic, where the sales associate is responding to her like, it\\'s $12,000 or whatever. Like oh, I know. There\\'s a waiting list, of course.\\n\\nBen: She name drops one of her celebrity clients and In order to say, it\\'s actually for them to try to move up the waitlist. Calamity ensues, they actually figure out that it\\'s for her, not the client. I actually haven\\'t watched the episode, but this is a cultural touchstone for the Birkin going from something that is whispered about in handbag circles and well-known by the wealthy elite to something that is now a very well known phenomena, which is good luck ever getting a Birkin bag and the crazy stories about the most expensive one ever selling for $500,000 on the secondary market, and Victoria Beckham having a collection of over a hundred. It\\'s crazy. It has become the Patek Philippe Nautilus of handbags, and people look at it almost as an investment.\\n\\nDavid: A way of summing up what you\\'re saying is the hard thing about buying a Birkin is not coming up with the money.\\n\\nBen: Which is crazy. It\\'s starting at $12,000 handbag. What you\\'re saying is that\\'s actually not the constraint.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. But also what you\\'re talking about, with echoes of our Nike episode here, the minute that you are in possession of a Birkin bag, you could immediately sell it for a lot more than what you paid for it.\\n\\nBen: And your Hermes essay will not be very happy that you did that, because the point of buying one is to own one, use one, and appreciate the craft, the work, and the beauty that went into this product. Hermes is not trying to sell it to people that are going to flip it. They\\'re trying to sell it to valued customers who will be people who appreciate the Hermes dream for the rest of their life.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. That would be the last Birkin bag that you\\'ll ever buy. Every bag, I think maybe even every item that Hermes makes, has what Hermes calls a blind stamp on it. This is a series of symbols and numbers.\\n\\nBen: There\\'s one on my belt right now.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, and some on my watch band right now, that are stamped into the leather that uniquely identify that item, the year it was made, and the craftsperson who made it.\\n\\nBen: There are some very cool stories of people who are transitioning from a crafts person who makes goods to repairs them later in their career and who receive an item back for repair, where they were the original creator of that handbag. That is the coolest, craziest, full circle Hermes moment for any Hermes craftsperson to see. This thing that I made that I really wanted to be durable and stand up in the world. How did it actually perform? To get it back 10, 20 years later and see it has got to be crazy cool.\\n\\nDavid: Yes.\\n\\nBen: Today, everything we\\'re talking about here, the Birkin bag, the Kelly bag, these $10,000-$100,000 retail handbags, depending on the type of exotic leather and everything, and the scarcity are referred to as a category of Veblen goods. This is essentially the opposite of everything you learned in econ 101.\\n\\nDavid: As is everything about this company.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Normally, price is where supply meets demand. As the price of a good increases, demand for it would go down. A Veblen good is the opposite. As price increases, people actually want it more. Price ends up being a signal that the item is desirable, and thus it stimulates demand now.\\n\\nInterestingly, David, this is exactly what you were talking about before. Birkin bags sell below the market clearing price. That is another defiance of microeconomics. Normally, things should Be priced exactly at the intersection of supply meeting demand.\\n\\nDavid: I was just laughing as you\\'re talking about Veblen goods there. I whipped out my copy of The Luxury Strategy and flipped to anti-law of marketing number 13, raise your prices as time goes on in order to increase demand.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s so interesting. But one way to look at this is, oh, it\\'s lost revenue. Their prices aren\\'t high enough because they can only make so many of them, and they\\'re selling them below the price people are willing to pay, so there\\'s money left on the table. Another way to look at it is that it\\'s an investment in the brand.\\n\\nThere\\'s a very good Substack writer, 310 value, that will link to in the show notes, who observed the supply demand mismatch creates scarcity in these two bags That scarcity likely creates more demand for the bags, elevates the overall status of Hermes, and creates demand for Hermes\\' other products, as customers buy Hermes\\'s other goods to build a relationship with the company in hopes of being allocated a bag at the below market retail price.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This is the same dynamic with I think a very different set of motivations as we talked about on the Nike episode. I very firmly believe that Nike could sell many of their shoes for two, three, four, or five times the price that they do. They\\'ll show up on Goat or StockX all the time regularly at higher prices than Nike releases them for. I believe that the reason that they do this is to maintain goodwill with their customer base and maintain Nike\\'s image as a brand that is accessible to everyone.\\n\\nHermes is doing the opposite. They want this to happen in order to maintain the image of Hermes, specifically the Birkins and the Kellys, as a brand and a product that is not accessible to everyone.\\n\\nBen: Yes. It\\'s not as simple as, well, they just keep raising the prices to make people keep wanting them more. You read that in The Luxury Strategy, and many luxury brands do that. In fact, Chanel has done it in record amounts the last couple of years. I think it\\'s called the Chanel classic flap medium or something like that. That\\'s had this crazy appreciation over the last few years where Chanel is just raising the price. Hermes doesn\\'t do that.\\n\\nDavid: We\\'ll talk about this more later in the episode. By my very back of the envelope calculations, they are raising their prices on average across the entire line, 7% per year for the last 10 years.\\n\\nBen: So it\\'s like 4% or 5% above inflation?\\n\\nDavid: Yup, which is more, but not an egregious amount.\\n\\nBen: Right. There was a study that found that the Birkin 30, which is one of the sizes in Togo leather didn\\'t even equal the rate of inflation in the US. I\\'m trying to figure out what the motivation here is because it\\'s a tremendous restraint. There\\'s no cash grab happening. Maybe it\\'s because, what bad things would happen to Hermes if they decided, you know what, Birkins are 20 now, not 12?\\n\\nDavid: Right. They\\'re already viewed as the most expensive handbags in the world. What harm done to go from 12 to 20?\\n\\nBen: Right. They sell a lot of them, so that actually would be a lot of profit dollars.\\n\\nDavid: Right. For somebody who\\'s going to spend 12,000 on a handbag, are that many more of those people going to be price sensitive at that swing from 12 to 20? Probably not.\\n\\nBen: Right. The Wall Street Journal estimated in 2020 that there\\'s about 120,000 of the combined Birkin and Kelly created each year, so 120,000 bags a year. If you decide that you want to make another 8000 of pure profit on each bag, that is tempting. I think it actually says a lot about Hermes\\' obsession with conservatism that they don\\'t meaningfully increase the price.\\n\\nThe Kelly is not far above its original 1950s price, inflation adjusted. I think the Birkin bag, the retail price was around $2000 when it launched in 1984, so call it maybe 6000 inflation adjusted. You\\'re looking at maybe twice the price that it launched out on an inflation adjusted basis.\\n\\nI guess the point I\\'m making here is, I think we should keep in the back of our mind the rest of the episode this question of, why doesn\\'t Hermes raise the prices? They\\'re already getting the benefit either way of the trickle down of people participating in the Hermes ecosystem to hopefully get the call one day. Why not make it even more expensive when you do get the call?\\n\\nDavid: Interesting. All right, let\\'s come back to that later in the episode.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Okay, 1984, Birkin release, doesn\\'t sell well for the first five years, then it becomes this cultural touchstone and gain steam every year after that.\\n\\nDavid: I was just thinking about that as we were chatting here. This makes sense to me that it wouldn\\'t be a hit right away. Because it takes time to build the lore and aura around this bag, you can\\'t just drop a new product and have it become this immediately in this category.\\n\\nBen: Correct.\\n\\nDavid: You\\'re never going to have like an iPhone of luxury handbags.\\n\\nBen: Correct. It has to be like a Taylor Swift concert. Actually, I think it\\'s a reasonable comp that her concert was extremely scarce, brand new product, priced at an extreme premium. That did sell right away, because the product had so much of the brand in it, like you knew exactly what you were going to get from going to the Taylor concert because you\\'re extremely familiar with the brand. But it\\'s not necessarily well understood that the Birkin equals Hermes in the way that The Eras Tour equals Taylor Swift.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. It\\'s also that the product was The Eras Tour, the product was not Midnights. If it were like, oh, I\\'m going to go to Taylor\\'s concert and listen to her play all the songs on the new album, of course a lot of people would still go. But it was like, no, I\\'m going to go to Taylor\\'s concert and hear all of Taylor.\\n\\nBen: All the amazing Hermes scarves from over the years released out of the vault.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, the Disney plus of Taylor. All right, different episode here. Okay, back to Jean-Louis. This is how he does it. He does two incredible things to save the company. (1) He repositions the prem. I can\\'t believe he pulled this off. He pulls off Not Your Mother\\'s Tiffany without saying Not Your Mother\\'s Tiffany, and the culmination of that is the Birkin bag and everything that that represents. (2) The internationalization, discovering, and running the same playbook that Racamier ran at Louis Vuitton.\\n\\nBy the end of Jean-Louis\\' tenure in 2006, a couple of years after the famous Sex in the City episode, Hermes has gone from well less than a hundred million dollars when he took over. The consultants were saying, outsource, shut it down, essentially. By the end of the decade of the 80s, he was just under half a billion dollars in revenue. In 2006, he\\'s taken it to $2 billion in annual revenue. From nice family business to this is a real, real thing.\\n\\nBen: One more time on those numbers.\\n\\nDavid: I don\\'t know the exact revenue figure when he took over, but let\\'s call it $50 million in annual revenue. We know it was well less than a hundred to 42 billion when he retires in 2006.\\n\\nBen: So 40x in 30 years?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, 40x in under 30 years.\\n\\nBen: Wow.\\n\\nDavid: Pretty good. Pretty transformative for the family business. Along the way, as the company clearly becomes more and more valuable, remember, he is the family member who\\'s running it, but we\\'re now on the fifth generation of the family. We\\'re starting to bleed into the sixth generation of the family. They\\'re now over 80 family members out there. Many of whom are involved in the business, but many of whom aren\\'t. Now this business that they all own is doing $2 billion a year in revenue at very, very high margins. There starts to be some demand for liquidity here.\\n\\nBen: Right. Every single one of those family members, most valuable asset and their entire net worth is their privately held Hermes stock that nobody can really put a price tag on. It\\'s just sitting there in everyone\\'s mind of like, it sure would be easier to live my life if I knew that this 90% of my net worth actually worth something that I could access and an even split. That\\'s $25 million a person. I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s the most valuable thing that any of them owns.\\n\\nDavid: Right. In 1993, Jean-Louis lists Hermes on the Paris Stock Exchange. Collectively, when the dust settles, the family has sold 19% of Hermes to the public. They still own 81%. Now, the public float grows a little bit over the years. As more family members sell, more generational transfer happens. More or less still, 70% plus family owned and controlled. It would really take some sort of absolute financial genius to come in and even consider. We owned over 70% of this business, we\\'re unassailable. Who on earth could possibly make a run at our company?\\n\\nBen: It would take a real wolf, I\\'ll tell you.\\n\\nDavid: This has been so fun. I\\'ve had so much fun with this episode. All this history, I just revel in the French connection and everything. This is Hermes\\' finest moment that we\\'re about to talk about here, through it all.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s interesting, it\\'s not their product.\\n\\nDavid: No. It has nothing to do with the product. The fight with Bernard Arnault.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Before that, now is a great time to share some new news about our longtime friend of the show, Vanta, the leading trust management platform. Vanta, of course, automates your security reviews and compliance efforts. Frameworks like SOC 2, ISO-27001, GDPR, HIPAA compliance, and monitoring, Vanta takes these otherwise time consuming and incredibly resource training efforts for your organization. It makes them fast and simple.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. The big news that they announced last week is they now have over 7000 customers just five years after launch. Vanta is the perfect example of a quote we talk about all the time here on Acquired, Jeff Bezos\\' idea that a company should only focus on what makes your beer actually taste better, i.e. spend your time and resources only on what\\'s actually going to move the needle for your product and customers and outsource everything else that doesn\\'t. Every company needs compliance and trust with their vendors and customers. It plays a major role in enabling your revenue because customers and partners demand it, but yet it adds zero flavor to your actual beer or your product.\\n\\nBen: Yes, Vanta takes care of all of that for you. No more spreadsheets, fragmented tools, manual reviews to cobble together your security and compliance requirements. It is a one single software pane of glass that connects you to all of your services via APIs and eliminates countless hours of work for your organization. They even launched a bunch of AI capabilities in the last year to make this even simpler and more powerful than before. They now integrate over 300 external tools and even enable customers to build private integrations with their internal systems.\\n\\nDavid: Critically, your security reviews are now real time instead of static, which you can monitor and share with your customers and partners. Vanta\\'s platform helps you continuously monitor compliance alongside reporting and tracking risk. Plus, you can save countless hours by completing security questionnaires with Vanta AI.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Vanta scales all the way from seed stage startups to large enterprises. If your company is ready to automate and streamline security reviews like 7000 other customers, go back to making your beer taste better and head to vanta.com/acquired, and just tell them that Ben and David sent you. Thanks to our friend Christina, Vanta\\'s CEO. All Acquired listeners get 1000 of free credit at vanta.com/acquired. David Rosenthal, us return to Bernard Arnault. It\\'s been 12 months.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s been too long.\\n\\nBen: I\\'ve been wanting to hear the other side of the story.\\n\\nDavid: I know. Okay, for anybody who\\'s listened to our LVMH episode, as we talked about earlier, the climax of the story is Bernard\\'s fight with Gucci in that episode. Gucci is the one that gets away, Bernard isn\\'t able to buy it. Right after the Gucci fight ends in the early 2000s, the same story plays out with Hermes.\\n\\nI think really in an even more dramatic fashion, in 2001, right after he lost Gucci, Bernard quietly buys an initial stake in Hermes of 4.9%. I believe that was just under the threshold that they would have to disclose it under French securities, regulations.\\n\\nHere\\'s what they do that the Hermes families couldn\\'t see coming that only Bernard could engineer. He continues buying for the next 10 years using equity swap derivatives. It looks like other entities are buying these shares on the open markets, but LVMH have the rights to exercise options to actually take those shares. This is really hard to remember. I had to triple check these numbers. At this point in time, Hermes\\' market cap is below $20 billion.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s 8%-9% of what it is today.\\n\\nDavid: When Bernard first starts buying in the early 2000s, it\\'s below $10 billion. You could say lots of things about Bernard and genius should be top of your list, but he is one of the best investors of all time. To identify Hermes at this point in time, and as we will see, he makes a Incredible amount of money on these trades, today, Hermes is a $230 billion market cap company, and he starts buying at below $10 billion.\\n\\nBen: Which is interesting. You say he spotted Hermes. It wasn\\'t hard to spot. The interesting thing is not that he realized it was the crown jewel of luxury, it was that he realized that the crown jewel of luxury could be worth 20-30 times as much as it was already worth.\\n\\nDavid: He starts buying Hermes shares. Axel, I think, jokes about this in an interview. He\\'s like, look, Bernard isn\\'t buying your shares just because he wants to make an investment or he wants to have some fun. Obviously, he wants to own Hermes.\\n\\nBen: By the way, when David and I are referencing these Axel interviews, it\\'s one interview. He made a random appearance here and there, but he has done one long form, on stage interview, and it is fantastic.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, it\\'s great. We\\'ll link to it in the sources. You should go watch it. Why is Bernard doing this? Obviously, on the one hand, he sees the value here. For God\\'s sakes, that Sex in the City episode was just dedicated to the Birkin. There\\'s a lot of value to be unlocked here, shall we say, in owning Hermes. But it\\'s not just that.\\n\\nI hope on our LVMH episode, this is some of the nuance that we painted about Bernard. He\\'s not just a corporate raider. He actually is an operator. He is one of, if not the best luxury operator out there. He sees two things in Hermes that maybe aren\\'t as obvious to the rest of the world and that he thinks actually are going to create an opportunity for him.\\n\\n(1) Generational transfer is about to happen. Jean-Louis can\\'t live forever. It\\'s not immediately clear who the next successor is going to be. Jean-Louis\\'s son, Pierre-Alexis, takes over as artistic director. Pierre-Alexis went to America for college. He went to Brown University.\\n\\nInteresting. In an interview, I found this. He initially wanted to study computer science at Brown, but he switched to art history, very fitting. He comes in and he joins Hermes right after graduation in 1992. He\\'s being groomed, but Jean-Louis wants to separate out the artistic director role and the CEO role.\\n\\nBen: They had been coupled before?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, he held both. Robert held both. Emile was both, Thierry was certainly both.\\n\\nBen: Right. That really illustrates the point you were making earlier that the creative and the business sides of the house are one side of the house.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Until this generation, it was one person. There was no separation at all. Pierre-Alexis is clearly the artistic heir. There\\'s not a clear CEO heir. In fact, Jean Louis\\' choice, Axel, who ultimately does become CEO, he\\'s not in the business yet.\\n\\nBen: Right. He did that internship, his five year apprenticeship, but then he left, right?\\n\\nDavid: Yes. The story is that Axel really wanted to go work in China. He goes into investment banking after undergrad. He goes to Sciences Po. Remember, Jean-Louis was his uncle, but his mother who actually was not a family member was the managing director for production for Hermes. Axel has this dinner table trading in addition to the apprenticeship craftsman trading, but he goes off into the investment banking world. He works first in China and then in New York for BNP Paribas.\\n\\nBen: Wow. He is an expert in corporate structure, and he\\'s an expert on this pretty interesting luxury market in the next 20 years China.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, and America too. But he doesn\\'t join the business until 2003 when Jean-Louis taps him. Again, on the one hand, as we\\'ve talked about, this is a nepotistic business, on the other hand, they\\'re not going to just give him the CEO title right away. He needs to come pay his dues. He starts in the finance department in 2003. Then in 2006, when Jean Louis retires, Axel takes over running the Jewelry métier as CEO of Jewelry.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, you should know, jewelry is not an important part of the Hermes business. It\\'s one of the 16 métiers. They don\\'t even break it out in earnings. It probably rolls up under other Hermes sectors, because I don\\'t think it\\'s under watches, and I don\\'t think it\\'s under ready to wear accessories. All of other is 12%, so I\\'m going to guess this thing is 1% to 3%.\\n\\nDavid: He does that for two years. In 2008, he goes and takes over the leather goods and saddlery business, the big one.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s 43% of the business, and I think at the time it was closer to 50%.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Bernard sees, okay, we\\'ve got a generational transfer opening here. In fact, when Jean-Louis retires in 2006, he promotes his COO right hand person, Patrick Thomas, to be the first non family member CEO running the business side of the house alongside Pierre-Alexis on the artistic side.\\n\\nBen: At least In retrospect, they try to make this seem like not a big deal that a non family member took over as CEO. They billed it as, well, they needed someone to look after the business in the interim period before the family was ready to have the next heir.\\n\\nDavid: I think there\\'s as much chance as not that that was right, but at a minimum, I think this shows the ignorance. I don\\'t want to say lackadaisicalness of the family here because it\\'s certainly not that, but maybe ignorance or naivete that, hey, you\\'re now a public company, and there are people like Bernard Arnault out there. You can\\'t just be like, oh, yeah, we\\'re going to do public company CEO transition in this way and take our time. You can, but you\\'re opening the door for the Arnaults of the world. That\\'s one thing that Bernard sees.\\n\\nThe other, and I really think this is a testament to his vision, despite all of the strength within Hermes and everything that Jean-Louis did, they actually are showing some cracks. This we had to piece together a little bit and talking to folks in the industry helped us out here. There\\'s no questioning Hermes\\'s financial results and on-the-surface brand value at this point in time in the 2000s, early 2010s, but there are a few things that are just starting to slip as they scale. I think, actually, the best story that illustrates this is one that the family members themselves do not tell but that you\\'ll hear out there in the lore about Hermes, which is that I believe it was in Japan, they had a product, a bag.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. This is so interesting, listeners. If you listen to other coverage of Hermes, you will hear this story.\\n\\nDavid: You never hear it from the perspective that we\\'re about to tell it. Okay, here\\'s how the story goes. Call it the late 2000s, early 2010s. Hermes is selling a canvas beach bag in Japan, and it is flying off the shelves, selling like hotcakes. It\\'s like an equivalent of $150 canvas tote bag beach bag. This obviously gets the attention of management and the company that this is happening.\\n\\nThey decide that they are going in true Hermes fashion. Because it is selling so well, they are going to not only stop selling the product. They\\'re going to take all their supply of it and destroy it. They come into a board meeting with all the family members. The management announced this, and it is met with a standing ovation from the family. This is upholding what Hermes is, which is we don\\'t sell beach bags.\\n\\nBen: The family and the board is so aligned that no one even asked a question about this, they just stood and gave applause. Here\\'s how this went on a meta level listeners. I heard this story, David heard this story. David texted me at one point and was like, isn\\'t this an odd story? I was like, what do you mean? We realized, oh, this is not ever told by any of the family members or company executives anywhere. It\\'s just out there, and the company is not secretive.\\n\\nDavid: They love telling these legendary Hermes stories.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, and they\\'ve got a 600-page document they release once every year that clearly lays out their entire strategy. They produce documentaries interviewing their artisans, showing videos of their factories. It rings a little bit odd. It\\'s like, okay, well, why are they not telling this story given how often it\\'s bandied about?\\n\\nDavid: Then you think about it a little bit and you\\'re like, wait a minute, why the F did this happen in the first place?\\n\\nBen: Exactly. A canvas beach bag in Japan?\\n\\nDavid: For $150?\\n\\nBen: And they\\'re making enough of it that it\\'s flying off the shelves? What company is this?\\n\\nDavid: How on earth did this happen? This story here is not a heroic one of we destroyed the supply. This is a tragic one.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s almost like when I was sitting there watching Wonder Woman 84. I was just so appalled at what I was watching that on this meta level, it occurred to me like, the story here isn\\'t the plot of this movie. The story here is, how do you have such a process failure at Warner Brothers where this thing was let out the door? That is a failure of creative leadership, and that is what you have going on with a $150 canvas tote bag after 175 years of successful Hermes brand stewardship.\\n\\nDavid: \\xa0Right, and building up the Birkin and the Kelly. For God\\'s sakes, the scarves sell for $500. That I think is the most visceral illustration of this. Two other things that I saw in the research and I think Bernard probably saw here, too. Towards the end of Jean-Louis tenure, he and Hermes started buying and investing in other companies. But why is Hermes doing this?\\n\\nBen: Right. This is the weird stuff going on at Nike when they were buying Converse was the good example, but Starter. It was almost like they didn\\'t realize, oh, we should be concentrating our firepower behind our one hero brand that they were trying to create the constellation of weak brands.\\n\\nDavid: The best Hermes could ever hope for by doing this is they\\'re going to be a subscale. They\\'re not even going to be a Richemont and Kerin.\\n\\nBen: One argument, bootmaker John Lobb and all these other companies that they either bought in whole or in part, it became important for them to own their key supplier relationships.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, those I think were probably strategic acquisitions.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, especially in watches where they actually fairly 25% position in the company that makes the movements to make sure that they have enough supply coming to them. That wasn\\'t all of what they were doing. They were also buying other brands.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Did you find the biggest disaster? This is in your wheelhouse.\\n\\nBen: I don\\'t know.\\n\\nDavid: I was wondering if I could stump you with this. They bought, I believe a 30%-35%. They were the largest shareholder in a German company that makes what is really a piece of technology, an old piece of technology, but not something that should be a luxury brand. This is very much in the performance end of the spectrum. They became the largest shareholders in Leica, the camera company.\\n\\nBen: Really?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. The motivation is like, oh, they\\'re beautiful, they\\'re luxurious cameras, they have leather on the, and we can put Hermes leather on the Leica cameras.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, if they made an Hermes edition Leica camera.\\n\\nDavid: They did.\\n\\nBen: I should probably look into that.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, you\\'re talking about a very narrow target market here. It\\'s a technology product. We\\'ll get into this with Apple in a minute. It didn\\'t go well, let\\'s put it that way. They ended up divesting the stake.\\n\\nBen: It reminds me of when the New York Times did all of this with all the TV stations in the 90s too. It\\'s almost like every company that ever thinks it\\'s a good idea to start buying up other brands is wrong.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, unless that is the core strategy of what you are doing like LVMH.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: The third thing that they do, they incubate and create a new luxury brand and company in China called Shang Xia. I believe I\\'m pronouncing that right. 2009 is when they launched it. It literally means up down or past-present. The idea is that the Chinese market is so big and so important to Hermes. They\\'re going to lend the Hermes brand to this new brand that is going to have Hermes principles, but take traditional Chinese craftsmanship of which there\\'s a long multi thousand year history.\\n\\nBen: Yup. I actually like the strategy.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. It sounds good on paper, but here\\'s the problem like we were talking about earlier. Nothing compares to French culture as an export and when you are buying luxury. This is a great experiment to run, sure. But the reality is that for probably most countries in the world, when you\\'re talking about spending $20,000 on a piece of leather, you want that to be from Hermes and you want that to be from France. I think this is especially true in China.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, that\\'s such a good point. It\\'s funny. I have a playbook theme called selling a sense of place to those outside it. The numbers behind this are crazy. Today, 76% of their production is in France and 85% is sold outside of France.\\n\\nFirst of all 76% of production in France is incredible the fact that they do this with all these different workshops that are scattered around the country. The incredible French history that is encapsulated by the brand, the French nobility, and the French sense of place, it really is just an intangible connection to the culture that is lusted after everywhere in the world. Why on earth would you throw that away when that really is the essence of your core asset?\\n\\nDavid: Now, easy for us to armchair quarterback here. Obviously, it didn\\'t work. They end up selling it off actually pretty recently to the Agnelli family from Italy, which is the family behind Fiat. Certainly that one, the Leica thing, it\\'s the combination of all these and the beach bag incident. Bernard sees all this.\\n\\nHere\\'s what he says in the press at the time. \"I would never diminish the quality of Hermes. Hermes can be an even rarer and greater quality business if they ever wanted to work with us.\" I think he\\'s genuine about that. The family obviously circles the wagons and mounts their rebel alliance here, mounting their defense against the empire.\\n\\nBen: Which I think is quite impressive.\\n\\nDavid: Absolutely.\\n\\nBen: The fact that they were able to link arms like this and say in the face of someone trying to make you and all your relatives collectively a multi billionaire in liquid cash, it\\'s incredible to link arms and manage to rebuff it.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. We\\'ll tell the story here, and it\\'s amazing. I think this is like a really important point that I want to land. I don\\'t think Arnaud was wrong. I think he had a point, and I think the company at the time didn\\'t get it. They certainly do now. Okay, what\\'s the story? What happens? Finally, in October of 2010, Arnault is patient.\\n\\nBen: He spent nine years.\\n\\nDavid: Nine plus years that he\\'s just building this stake, being patient. In October, 2010 LVMH exercises its options on the equity swaps that it owns and announces that it had now controls 14.2% of Hermes shares. Bernard at the time says, I had to do it, because other luxury groups were also talking about making a run at Hermes, and I didn\\'t want this crown jewel of France to be owned, heaven forbid, maybe by a non-French organization. A quote here, \"I could not sit by and allow a competitor or another investor to take a stake in Hermes.\" He\\'s good. He\\'s so good.\\n\\nBen: I love it.\\n\\nDavid: In response to this is the famous or infamous, if you will, quote from Patrick Thomas, the then CEO of Hermes, which we\\'re not going to say the full thing here on air. You can go google it. This is an official press conference with investor relations people. He says, \"If you want to seduce a beautiful woman,\" Obviously Hermes being the beautiful woman here, \"You don\\'t start in the fashion that Bernard is\" And he doesn\\'t use those words.\\n\\nThis is hilarious. This is amazing. That makes, of course, a huge splash in the French and international press. The drama here is delicious. Karl Lagerfeld is asked his thoughts on what\\'s going on here. Lagerfeld, of course, is a legend. He\\'s the longtime creative director of Chanel. He comments publicly. \"If you don\\'t want to be taken over, don\\'t put your business on the public market.\"\\n\\nBen: Game recognize game. That\\'s a great point.\\n\\nDavid: He\\'s got a point.\\n\\nBen: If you want liquidity, this is the trade off you make.\\n\\nDavid: Of course, Lagerfeld, yes, famously is the creative director of Chanel, but he wasn\\'t exclusively the creative director of Chanel, who he is also working for at this point in time. He is also, I believe, the men\\'s wear creative director for Fendi, which is owned by By LVMH.\\n\\nBen: He\\'s on payroll.\\n\\nDavid: He\\'s on payroll. This continues on for months in the public markets and in the press. By December of 2011, the LVMH stake has grown to 22.6%. The family owns 73% of the company at this point, so Bernard now owns almost the entire public float of Hermes.\\n\\nBen: There\\'s 3.5% of Hermes that\\'s publicly floated he doesn\\'t own?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Hermes is in danger of being delisted from the stock exchange.\\n\\nBen: Crazy.\\n\\nDavid: This is what\\'s so brilliant. You might ask, why does this matter? The family owned 73%, Bernard can\\'t do anything. Price is a function of supply and demand. As Bernard is shrinking the float of this company, the shares that are available for trade on the public markets, what happens to the stock price?\\n\\nBen: Skyrocket.\\n\\nDavid: It goes through the roof. Now you\\'ve got 80 family members, and they already thought they were really wealthy. They already wanted liquidity. Now, Bernard\\'s coming to them. This is a strategy. Let\\'s just go pick off individual family members one by one, keep increasing his stake, and saying, yeah, I\\'ll pay you the market price, which is now incredibly inflated for this company. Great. Happy to pay you many hundreds of millions of dollars.\\n\\nBen: Crazy.\\n\\nDavid: What happens? This is why I think this really was the family and the company\\'s finest moment. That temptation must have been extreme. That\\'s just the externally identifiable motivations. I\\'m sure Bernard, other people at LVMH, and everybody else in the industry is doing everything they can to convince family members to sell.\\n\\nBen: Right, and all it takes is one week link or probably a few week links, because the ownership is so divided into tiny chunks by this point. Six generations in, it\\'s pretty peanut buttered around.\\n\\nDavid: I think also just from a psychological perspective, a couple dominoes fall here. As a family member, you start looking around and being like, do I want to be the last one? It\\'s like a crowded theater running for the exits. At the time, you\\'re thinking about like, holy crap.\\n\\nBen: This is the best it\\'s ever going to get.\\n\\nDavid: I may never see another opportunity to get liquid at this price ever. The minute that other family members start selling, supply and demand, the price goes down.\\n\\nBen: Right, I cannot be the last, and it would suck to be the second or the third.\\n\\nDavid: In 2011, the family comes together and over 50 of the 80 family members collectively contribute 50.2% of the equity in the company into a new cooperative vehicle that\\'s called H51, as in 51% of Hermes, as in this vehicle will have majority control of the company. When they contribute their equity into this vehicle, they contractually agree that that equity will be locked up and cannot be sold at least 20 years.\\n\\nThey\\'re basically saying that Bernard, no matter what you do, you could pick off anybody else after this for a minimum of 20 years with potential to extend beyond that. You will never, never, never, you or anybody else have control of Hermes.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s so badass.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s so badass.\\n\\nBen: Dude, you and I should contribute. We should make A51. Even though it\\'s completely unnecessary, it just feels right for Acquired. I think you and I can each maintain 24.5% stakes, but A51 really should...\\n\\nDavid: I love it. We haven\\'t floated our business on the public markets yet, so we\\'re taking Karl Lagerfeld\\'s advice. We don\\'t need to incur the legal fees around doing this. That vehicle was and is still headed by one of the family members, Julie Guerrand, who was an investment banker at Rothschild. She leaves and full time becomes head of the defense, I assume alongside Axel, who obviously comes from the banking world, too.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s so interesting. I wonder if you actually can structure articles of incorporation to say under no circumstances, can this entity sell what it owns? Normally, what you would do is say, it requires a vote of unanimous from the board of directors, blah, blah, blah, but that leaves you vulnerable to the board of directors getting lobbied and convinced. This is not a public document, so we can\\'t really know, but I wonder how airtight can you really make something and how irreversible?\\n\\nDavid: I don\\'t believe these documents are public. My understanding from comments that family members and Axel make about them, and spoiler alert, recently they\\'ve renewed the term of this for another 10 years, so it\\'s into the mid 2040s.\\n\\nBen: They\\'re like, Bernard, you will be dead when this expires. That\\'s exactly what that is.\\n\\nDavid: I believe it\\'s pretty ironclad that these shares cannot be sold.\\n\\nBen: Wow.\\n\\nDavid: In addition to that, two of the Puech brothers, Bertrand and Nicolas, Nicolas is the one that there\\'s the gardener drama about right now.\\n\\nBen: We should say, listeners, in case you don\\'t know, there\\'s a lot of stories floating around in the press right now that Nicolas Puech is going to give half of his stake in Hermes, which represents something like a little under 3% to his gardener or his ex gardener, who\\'s now 51, nobody knows his name.\\n\\nDavid: Nicolas does not have children, heirs, or other heirs.\\n\\nBen: Right. There\\'s a press story right now that just shy of 3% of Hermes could be given to the family gardener.\\n\\nDavid: Anyway, the two Puech brothers do not contribute their shares to H51, but they give H51 a right of first refusal on their shares. They could sell their shares, but at whatever price they agree to, the rest of the family has an offer on purchasing them.\\n\\nBen: Interesting.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s another, probably 10%-15% of Hermes right there.\\n\\nBen: Whoa. Okay, that\\'s significant. I wonder how this gardener thing is going to play out.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Those shares would be, I believe, subject to that offer, assuming that that has stayed in place. Anyway, this is really just an incredible coordination. Yes, it\\'s a family, they\\'re all family, but there are 80 people here.\\n\\nBen: The fact that they actually rebuffed this offer and that Bernard sold down his stake is crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Let\\'s get into what happens with Bernard\\'s stake, because famously, as Domenico De Sole said in the press at the end of the Gucci affair, even when he loses, he still wins, and Bernard still wins here. This effectively ends the takeover bid when H51 is put in place. Meanwhile, there are all sorts of lawsuits going on, particularly around how LVMH amassed this stake in secret with the equity swaps.\\n\\nBen: It was basically illegal, right?\\n\\nDavid: In 2014, the French court rules that this was illegal. LVMH has to pay a fine, I believe \\xa0a $10-$15 million fine for having done this.\\n\\nBen: Pennies.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, right. As we\\'ll see, it\\'s truly pennies. They also mandate that LVMH needs to distribute out that Hermes stake to its own shareholders. LVMH can no longer hold the stake. Who\\'s the largest shareholder in LVMH? It\\'s Group Arnault, which is Bernard Arnault\\'s family office. They get 8% of Hermes personally into his family office entity. This is the brilliance of Bernard. They take that value, which is on the order of $5 billion. Remember, when they started buying, the whole company was trading at a market cap below $10 billion.\\n\\nBen: Massively appreciated stock. They basically created value out of nowhere here. This billions of dollars landing in Bernard\\'s personal bank account, he has created that money out of nowhere.\\n\\nDavid: He has unlocked shareholder value for sure, even in the absence of a change of control transaction. Back when Bernard was engineering his takeover of LVMH, one of the financial instruments that he used to do it was he IPO\\'d a 25% stake in Dior. He already owned Dior that he had gotten out of bankruptcy from Boussac.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s right. He had this Russian doll structure, where he owned a slim majority of an entity that owned a slim majority of an entity, that owned a slim majority. He was able to generate a bunch of liquid cash from all the minority shares that he sold off, but he still got to control Dior, LVMH, Group Arnault, because he was technically the majority owner of each of them.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, but he and LVMH didn\\'t own this 25% minority stake in Dior. He takes the Hermes shares and does a share swap. Swaps that value directly with the 25% of Dior that he doesn\\'t own to bring that first into Group Arnault, his family office, and then he trades that into LVMH. LVMH now, finally, as a result of this, is able to take 100% control of Dior.\\n\\nIn exchange for group are no trading this asset into Dior, Bernard\\'s ownership of LVMH goes from 36% up to 46%. He gets an extra 10 percent of LVMH. Here\\'s the most incredible aspect of this. Not a single dollar in tax is paid on all of this because it\\'s all share swaps. Basically, Bernard just gets 10% more of his own company as a result of this.\\n\\nBen: Which would then go on to appreciate.\\n\\nDavid: 400%-500% over the next five to six years.\\n\\nBen: 5x\\'d since 2017?\\n\\nDavid: Yeah.\\n\\nBen: Wow. Even when he loses, he wins.\\n\\nDavid: Unbelievable. This is a situation where everybody wins. I don\\'t think there are any losers here. The Hermes families absolutely are not losers. You could even say they have the last laugh here. Yes, Bernard gets to benefit from an extra 4x-5x appreciation in LVMH\\'s market cap here. From the real beginning of when LVMH publicly announces their stake in Hermes, 2010, Hermes\\' market cap is up 16x.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s crazy. The reason why no one\\'s a loser here and everyone\\'s a winner is because Hermes truly is the crown jewel. It is such an unassailable, exceptional business. The last 12 months, it did $14 billion in revenue, $5.7 billion in operating income. They have a 71% gross margin and a 44% operating margin. It\\'s a software business that doesn\\'t need any R&D.\\n\\nDavid: Tech companies go like, I don\\'t know what Hermes color to call it, but some color with envy over this. There is one more chapter of the story that we have to tell, because that wouldn\\'t have just happened. It wasn\\'t just the Bernard affair in and of itself that led to this 16x market cap increase. He was right, like I was saying earlier. There were, I think, some real problems in the business. That is the story of the sixth generation of Pierre-Alexis and Axel, who I think have certainly fixed those problems, but have really led Hermes, the business, and the company into a whole new era.\\n\\nBen: Yes, that is absolutely right. There is a quote that I want to start with for the Axel Dumas era, which is possibly the best articulation that I\\'ve ever heard of business strategy anywhere. He did it in the interview that we were talking about. He says, \"Every decision that we make has got some reverse effect.\" Which I think is like a French translation for trade off.\\n\\n\"Every decision we make has got some trade off. There\\'s something I really like about strategy in Michael Porter. Strategy is accepting that you are doing something better than the other, and the other is doing something better than you. You have to pick your fight. I\\'m always a little bit disappointed when I see someone on my team say that we do everything at the same time. Great. That doesn\\'t happen in real life. You have to pick your fight, and Hermes picks their fights better than anyone/\"\\n\\nDavid: What they\\'ve done over the last 10 years since the Bernard fight is that they have figured out how to scale handcrafted artisanal production.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: On the surface, those are completely oxymoronic terms. Those are completely diametrically opposed.\\n\\nBen: This is a dead art in the world, and Hermes manages to crank out hundreds of thousands of products that otherwise would only be created by individual makers with no infrastructure, no brand, it\\'d be really hard to discover them, and frankly, they would all just go out of business. Most of them go out of business anyway.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. What was the stat that you said a little while ago that there are 120,000 Birkins and Kellys produced every year?\\n\\nBen: Yup, exactly.\\n\\nDavid: If they were still making these things on the third floor at the Faubourg, no way. This was the problem and what the consultants were saying at the start of Jean-Louis\\' tenure of like, hey, you need to outsource production, you need to scale production, you need to make this more accessible.\\n\\nBen: Right, you have a global brand now. You need to figure out how to serve the demand for your brand.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. The Patrick Thomas quote that I want to start with is so great. \"The luxury industry is built on a paradox. The more desirable a brand becomes, the more it sells. But the more it sells, the less desirable it becomes.\" We\\'ve been talking about this whole episode, but then he continues. \"I believe Hermes\\' vision provides a solution to this dilemma.\" This is what the current generation has found, the solution.\\n\\nToday. I think we referenced this earlier in the episode, Hermes employs 7000 master craftspeople, artisans. Most of the story that we\\'ve been telling thus far, until 1992, all of the craftspeople in the company, more or less, were working in the Faubourg in this one relatively small building on the Rue Faubourg du Saint-Honoré in Paris.\\n\\nIn 1992, they moved production to Pantin in the suburbs of Paris. That building is amazing, but only houses about 250-300 craftspeople. Actually, still to this day, Axel talks about this a lot, any one of their production sites does not have more than 250-300 craftspeople.\\n\\nBen: Yes. They believe that every single person should know each other by name. They think that 250-300 is the natural limit on that. Axel even says, if you have more than 300, it is not a workshop, it\\'s a factory.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, and they are not in the business of factories. At the same time, he and the company have stated as an explicit goal that they will ramp up production capacity by 7% every year. As the company gets larger and larger, today that means adding 500 artisans every year.\\n\\nBen: Crazy. When Axel started at the company all the way back in the 80s, there were 250 craftsmen, period. They hired two craftsmen per year in the late 80s.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Here\\'s the issue though. How on earth are you going to do this? Like you were saying, this is a dead art. Nobody else does this.\\n\\nBen: Little maker with a workshop in San Francisco or a workshop in Paris, but how are you even going to find them?\\n\\nDavid: Right. Those people, the Beatrices here in San Francisco, they\\'re entrepreneurs. They\\'re not going to go back to joining Hermes, because they all came from Hermes in the first place. How are you going to hire 500 a year? It\\'s not like they can go higher from their competitors. They\\'re not doing this.\\n\\nBen: Right. Their competitors have all outsourced production and embraced assembly lines.\\n\\nDavid: They do the only thing that you can do. They build the pipeline of training master craftspeople and artisans entirely themselves. They build schools, they build training centers. They go to parts of France that are in rural areas, that have high unemployment.\\n\\nThey go to those areas, they open trade schools, and they say, we\\'re going to train you. They have 100% graduation rates. They\\'re like, we\\'re not going to give up on you, we\\'re going to make sure you learn this trade that you graduate. You may not come work for Hermes when you graduate, but we\\'re going to give you this skill. Then we\\'re going to offer you a job as a master craftsman.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s crazy.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s unbelievable. Even through the Jean-Louis era, the fifth generation, Beatrice was the anomaly as a woman. These were all old men that were doing this stuff. Today, the average age of the Hermes artisan workforce is 30 years old and 80% are women.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s wild.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s a wholesale transformation. They are training them. They actually just opened in 2021, their first official French governmentally sanctioned degree granting program, the École Hermès de Savoie Ferre. This is the savoir faire that pops up in the annual report a hundred whatever times.\\n\\nBen: Let\\'s name a school after it too.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. They\\'re getting into government policy here. They are preserving and growing this art form in France.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, they\\'re not France\\'s largest export, because they have a very constrained way that they can create the products, but they may be France\\'s finest export. It behooves the French government to try to figure out how to make this last another hundred years.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Today, there are 31 Hermès ateliers, artisan manufacturing facilities all throughout the country, each with no more than 250-300 people in it.\\n\\nBen: Right. It\\'s the cloud computing idea of scaling horizontally.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. This is AWS. This is the point I\\'m getting to.\\n\\nBen: Right. They\\'re building data centers.\\n\\nDavid: They were Amazon and they added AWS. They are adding two to four of those every year.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s so funny, you had that thought too. It\\'s all people. It\\'s all sticking to the thing that got them here, which is every product or at least every leather goods product, every handbag made end to end by one artisan trained in the traditional early 20th century way.\\n\\nDavid: Speaking of cloud computing, we want to share a fun thing that our friends at NVIDIA have given us. For anyone considering attending GTC this year, Acquired listeners get a 20% discount. This is their big annual conference that Ben and I have watched over a dozen keynotes from to prep for our NVIDIA series.\\n\\nBen: Yup. It\\'ll be March 18th-21st, 2024 at the San Jose Convention Center. It is the first time back in person in five years, which is crazy. It\\'s the most important AI conference in the world. Jensen will be speaking to 10,000 people live in person.\\n\\nDavid: Wow. There are also researchers speaking from OpenAI, Meta, Google, DeepMind, Microsoft, Forge, Genentech, Disney, National Labs, and more. It\\'s crazy. They will have a whole bunch of futuristic vehicles, robots on display.\\n\\nBen: Yup. If you want to check it out, click the link in the show notes and enter the code ACQUIRED at checkout \\xa0to give you 20%. Thanks to our friends at NVIDIA. Now, back to Hermes.\\n\\nDavid: This is an insane idea that leather goods, which is 43% of the business, Hermes did €11.6 billion in revenue last year. They\\'re on track to probably do €14 billion.\\n\\nBen: Yup. The last 12 months is €14 billion.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. That €6 billion of that is going to be handcrafted items, where one artisan makes one item at a time, and they\\'re sold around the world. €6 billion worth of that every year growing at 15%-20% a year? Yeah, wild.\\n\\nBen: This is a really important thing to understand about the company. (1) They firmly believe that only 250-300 craftsmen can work in a building. (2) It takes two-plus years for someone to learn the craft and apprentice. (3) Every one of these things must be created by one individual by hand. If you believe all those three things for sure, then it forces a very specific constraint on your business, and you must work backward from that.\\n\\nYou can only train so fast. You can only produce so fast, which then of course means that it affects your products, it affects the availability, and it affects the price, which of course means that it affects the customer set. There\\'s a way to view Hermes, which is they want the very highest end customer with zero price sensitivity. They do whatever they need to serve that master.\\n\\nI think there\\'s another very real way to look at it, which is how the company describes themselves that starts with the constraints of the craft. When you hold true to that ethos at its most extreme, you end up with the company\\'s brand and posture that you have today as the only logical end point. They can only hire 300, 400, or 500 craftsmen a year. They can only do this other stuff. Good luck getting a Birkin bag. It\\'s just one of these things where you can say they\\'re artificially constraining supply all you want.\\n\\nDavid: As long as they do things this way, this is the max throughput.\\n\\nBen: They would have to change something. They would have to say, hey, There\\'s some new fancy saddle stitching machine that it turns out makes us just as high a quality product, and every craftsman is twice as effective or something like that. But until they fold on one of these constraints that they\\'ve decided are stakes in the ground, the result is the scarcity. That\\'s not the goal, that\\'s the result.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. The Amazon comparison is so apt here. Hermes has this incredible unassailable flywheel, but it operates in the exact opposite way of an Amazon flywheel. It\\'s not about maximizing the cycles, it\\'s slowing. It\\'s minimizing. It\\'s an intentionally rate limited flywheel, and it all works together.\\n\\nBen: At the end of the day, it is probably true that neither one is the starting place, and neither one is the ending place. The two things that I\\'m referring to here are the method of craftsmanship and the price and scarcity. They just work harmoniously together. One is not driving the other. It is that they both want the brand posture that they have, and they want the constraints that they have, so it works together perfectly.\\n\\nA cynical person could be like, well, yeah, all that handcrafted mumbo jumbo only exists, because that\\'s how you justify the brand pricing and availability that they\\'ve put in place. But I think it all works in concert.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. We\\'ve told the whole episode. I\\'m thinking back to what Beatrice told me when I asked her why. If a master craftsperson made this thing by hand, it has a soul. If a machine made it in an assembly line, it does not.\\n\\nBen: Right. Maybe, but sure. In an assembly line with crappy ingredients, blah, blah, blah, sure, but can craftsmen use better tools? Yes. Will Hermes continue to embrace tools that make craftsmen more efficient? At some point, did they use sharper knives than were previously available in the past? They totally did. Will they use things that make the needle go a little faster? Maybe.\\n\\nDavid: Totally. Let\\'s take a step back here. We got to consider the exact opposite case study of this, which is a hundred percent happening to great success, which in a lot of ways is the same thing that the consultants told Jean-Louis back in the day, look at the rest of the industry. Louis Vuitton, which as we talked about, has the same caliber of heritage and history as Hermes.\\n\\nBen: Yes. It could have Hermes\\'s gravity if it wanted to, but instead you can buy a checkerboard cotton sweatshirt with 120 LVs on it.\\n\\nDavid: Right. They are having the same level of success, the same margins. It\\'s working like a charm.\\n\\nBen: But it\\'s less durable.\\n\\nDavid: I think that\\'s the question. Is it less durable, or is it just that these are different strategies? Here\\'s the crux of it that we\\'ve also been teasing on the episode that I think now\\'s the time to come back to, this thing that I\\'m wearing on my wrist, the Apple Watch partnership.\\n\\nBen: Out of left field, very surprising, very odd for the brand to do this.\\n\\nDavid: I have a lot of complicated feelings about the thing on my wrist, including primarily that I love it. Okay, here\\'s the story. In 2015, Apple launches the Apple Watch. Supposedly, the story goes that Jony Ive, and the watch I think was really Jony\\'s pet project as his last hurrah before leaving Apple, he had all these quotes at the time of the Swiss watch industry, better watch out, we\\'re coming for them, et cetera.\\n\\nBen: Which was true. Different market, but it\\'s by far the best selling watch in the world.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, but as far from been the death knell of the Swiss watch industry.\\n\\nBen: Right, yeah. The Swiss watch industry has done just fine since the Apple watch came out on the high end.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. Marc Newson was consulting for Apple specifically on the watch, and Jony asked Marc to introduce him to Pierre-Alexis, Axel, and to Hermes. Apple was looking for a luxury fashion brand. Remember, there is the Apple watch edition in the beginning that was like the gold Apple watch and all that.\\n\\nBen: Man, $10,000 for something that was going to be obsolete in a year. It\\'s crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. That clearly didn\\'t work.\\n\\nBen: But it\\'s beautiful.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, totally beautiful, but they needed a luxury brand. They needed a brand that was not deeply in bed with the traditional Swiss watch industry, which some of these luxury groups are.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s funny. I hadn\\'t actually made that connection that that\\'s why it\\'s Hermes and not...\\n\\nDavid: I think there are two reasons. That\\'s one reason. The other reason is they needed a brand that was going to appeal to pretty much everybody. For everything we\\'ve talked about with Louis Vuitton and how successful that\\'s been, it\\'s polarizing.\\n\\nBen: Totally. Apple also needed to go to the very top of whatever they were going to grab. The thing about Hermes is whatever they make...\\n\\nDavid: Nobody is ever going to say that Hermes makes crap.\\n\\nBen: Right. They make the most fully realized version of whatever they\\'re making. If they have an idea, they want to release the best possible, most extreme, exquisite version of that thing. That\\'s very Apple. Apple has to make compromises for the scale that they\\'re at. But if Apple had partnered with someone that was more opinionated, let\\'s say they were better in some ways but worse than others, it doesn\\'t play for Apple\\'s brand. They need to partner with someone unassailable.\\n\\nDavid: Axel and Pierre Alexi talk about this all the time when they\\'re asked about, oh, XYZ flashy celebrity is carrying a Birkin bag, blah, blah, blah, they say, look, we don\\'t judge. We never judge here at Hermes. Our clients are our clients, whether it\\'s Grace Kelly or Kim Kardashian. That\\'s what Apple needed.\\n\\nAxel has a great quote on this. He says, \"We had an incredible talk with Jonathan Ive, and there was a lot of mutual admiration and common values. From that, we said, wouldn\\'t it be nice to have something combining our craftsmanship, our vision? It was about trying to make a contemporary, elegant object. It was not a master plan of global domination.\"\\n\\nOkay. This thing on my wrist is exactly what Axel is saying there. It is a contemporary, elegant object that is beautiful leather. The reason I bought it is for my life and modern life, this thing is on my wrist 23 hours a day. I sleep with it.\\n\\nBen: A hundred percent. I love the Hermes slim to Hermes watch. I looked at that thing five times during research lusting after it and ultimately closed the browser tab being like, I wear an Apple watch all day every day. There\\'s just no world where it actually makes sense for me to own a different watch.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Even more than my phone, this thing is part of me. When I was looking to do research for this episode and buy a bit of the Hermes dream, I couldn\\'t imagine anything more appropriate be closer to me than literally it\\'s on my wrist 23 hours a day. At the same time, I find it absolutely terrifying from the perspective of what it means for Hermes and the Hermes\\' future, not because I think that Apple and technology is going to take over the world, but I think there are some serious problems with this product along the lines of the issues that Bernard identified in the company when he was making his run.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the price. I bought the deployment buckle version of the strap, because I thought it looked amazing. It is the most expensive version of the band that Hermes sells as such, and it costs $540.\\n\\nBen: Which is expensive for an Apple watch band, but it\\'s in the ballpark of Apple accessories, or it\\'s at least maybe twice as much as normal Apple accessories.\\n\\nDavid: This is among the cheapest leather products that Hermes sells. As a comparison, if you want to go buy an Hermes luggage tag, $640. Let\\'s move out of leather goods for a second. If you want to go buy an Hermes sweatshirt, over $2000. If you want to buy an Hermes piece of furniture, and they make incredibly beautiful furniture, $40,000 minimum. $540 for this thing, it\\'s not priced right for an Hermes product. It\\'s too low.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s somehow bridging the gap between an Apple product and an Hermes product.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, and maybe that\\'s because it\\'s also sold in Apple stores, et cetera. But related to that, you start to think about that, wait, why is the price so low? On the exquisite orange packaging and box that this thing came in, nowhere on it nor on the product page on the website does it say that it was handmade.\\n\\nBen: So Hermes\\' belts, I believe they\\'re Apple watches, and there are other things, are machine zone?\\n\\nDavid: This to me is like, wow. Would I have spent $2000 on a handmade Apple Watch Hermes band? Maybe, maybe not. I don\\'t know. Whether I would have is irrelevant. Hermes should be selling $2000 handmade Apple Watch bands.\\n\\nBen: Even if people aren\\'t buying them, that\\'s the question. I agree with you, because what I think this does is it defies how I think of Hermes, which is whatever they\\'re going to do, they\\'re going to do it at the logical extreme. They\\'re not going to compromise. They\\'re not going to figure out how to address a lower market. They\\'re going to sell the same expensive scarf that they sold their grandma to you, but they\\'re going to have a different way to advertise it. This is weird.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s weird.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s a compromise. I think the same thing about their belts, by the way. I think the same thing about anything that is machine sewn so it can be mass produced and have availability in every store. It feels like they don\\'t promise that everything they make is hand sewn, but it feels like a mild violation of the brand promise.\\n\\nDavid: Right, yeah. I don\\'t know. On the one hand, I love it. I don\\'t want any other Apple watch strap. It is an Hermes product. It\\'s beautiful. On the other hand, yeah, it feels like a profanity.\\n\\nBen: You\\'re right, it does feel like a profanity. Apple is the you know most valuable brand in the world, but the most common brand in the world. For Hermes to associate with such a common brand feels odd. Apple is the definition of mass market at this point.\\n\\nDavid: I think that is certainly part of it The thing that is really just head scratching to me about it is, why did they not sell these things for four times as much and make them by hand? What are they getting out of selling a machine made strap for $540?\\n\\nBen: Maybe you\\'re now an Hermes customer and over the next 50 years, you\\'re on a journey with them.\\n\\nDavid: I think that\\'s true. I mean, I\\'m going back tomorrow.\\n\\nBen: What are you getting tomorrow?\\n\\nDavid: I don\\'t want to spoil Jenny\\'s birthday/Valentine surprise. I\\'m actually getting two things, but we\\'ll talk about this on a future episode.\\n\\nBen: Okay. Sounds good. Cliffhanger.\\n\\nDavid: Cliffhanger. Just to put some numbers and finish out the story, by 2018, revenue has grown from €3.5-€4 billion when Axel took over in 2013. By 2018, that\\'s €6 billion. In 2019, it\\'s €7 billion. It dips a bit during 2020 with the pandemic, but then €9 billion in 2021. Last year, €11. 6. Like we said, on track for €14 billion in 2023. This is an absolutely resounding success.\\n\\nAs we\\'ve said, what Axel, Pierre-Alexis, and this generation of the family has done like all the generations before them has been nothing short of amazing, starting with the defense against Bernard. Incredible. I don\\'t want to fully judge or leave a negative mark on the company solely because of the Apple watch thing, but I just got to say, we\\'ve seen with a few times here in these generations that the seeds of the next challenge are sown in the current generation. I wonder if this is it here.\\n\\nBen: Hermes has always thrived by figuring out how to be above it all and it be counterposition to the rest of luxury. It\\'s an open question, I think, of whether the Apple partnership helps that or hurts that. Okay, a few more stats on the business today before we move into analysis. Does that sound good to you, David?\\n\\nDavid: Great.\\n\\nBen: I thought one fascinating thing was Axel saying that with the 4. 3 billion in net income that they do, they always split it roughly the same way. One third to the dividend, one third gets reinvested in capex, and one third in cash. What\\'s pretty interesting is, they have a reasonably low reinvestment rate. They\\'re dividending out a lot of cash, and they\\'re holding onto a lot of cash. Two thirds of it.\\n\\nWhat\\'s obvious there in the numbers that we\\'ve talked about in a more subjective way is they have a limited ability to actually reinvest in the business. It\\'s much like Costco. They\\'re constrained by factors other than capital. You give them more money, they can\\'t do anything with it, which I just find fascinating. They can only train the craftspeople so fast.\\n\\nFrankly at some point, they\\'ll saturate the market too. If they\\'re going to address the whole world, they\\'re going to have to change what they sell, and the Apple Watch may be the first little version of that. They grew 20%-25% last year. They can\\'t keep growing at 25% without changing what Hermes stands for. Even if they could train these craftspeople as fast as possible, they have another governor, which is scarcity, product image, price. At some point, they\\'ll bump up against the walls of that, and no additional craftspeople and no additional money can help them grow anymore.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s such a good point. That\\'s the counterpoint to my impassioned concern a minute ago. Okay, great, David, everything you were just saying, that translates to Hermes is a museum, and Hermes is not a museum. It has to meet its clients where they are. Like I said, I wear this thing 23 hours a day. I couldn\\'t imagine buying any other product from them.\\n\\nBen: I\\'m sure there are some members of the family that want to walk around with their nose in the air, be a museum, and say, Hermes is pure, and I want to go my whole life and then die with Hermes remaining pure. There are other members of the family that are like, can we serve customers and grow this business? My God. That Apple Watch represents the second faction.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, totally.\\n\\nBen: Next, their cash position. They\\'ve got $10 billion in cash, and that is after materially increasing the dividend for the first time in a decade. They\\'ve recently just started dividending out more cash, which again is emblematic of the same idea of money is not our constraint, which is pretty new for the business. That\\'s a decade or two old problem that never existed over the first 170 years.\\n\\nAn interesting thing to know about a business is it was always run under the constraint of even if we see growth opportunities, we don\\'t have enough cash to pursue all of them. Now they actually do. It\\'s interesting to see how management responds in this opportunity for abundance that they have and figures out how to treat certain elements of the business as a scarce resource, even though they don\\'t have to.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. Now, certainly there is an element too to the dividend that is part of making the family shareholding lock up an easier pill to swallow.\\n\\nBen: Yes, quite palatable. The segments of the business, leather goods and salary is 43%. That\\'s the big guy. We didn\\'t talk about this much on the episode, but ready to wear and accessories is 27%. That\\'s a big chunk.\\n\\nThe second largest chunk of the business is clothing, effectively. I have an open question of whether they should be in clothing. Isn\\'t it antithetical? Certainly, it\\'s odd to see them in the fashion world, and they do these runway shows, and they do couture, but it feels weird. It somehow feels antithetical in some way.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. They\\'re not a fashion brand, and yet they participate in it.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Next largest segment after that is silk and textiles. It\\'s so remarkable how small the scarf business has become of their overall mix given that it used to be close to half the business. After that is perfume and beauty at 4%, watches at 4%, and then there\\'s a couple categories of others, which I think it\\'s really interesting to look at perfume and beauty as another glimpse of what\\'s to come. They make a hundred dollar bottles of perfume, and they sell them at department stores.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, and they launched beauty in 2020 with lipstick.\\n\\nBen: Yup, which I think is very China focused. It\\'s very interesting to me that they are trying to appeal, especially to a younger demographic, with a lot of their recent perfumes and selling in department stores. Again, it feels antithetical to Hermes as this pure brand. But on the other hand, it\\'s a continuation of the Apple Watch strategy even further.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. There\\'s one more elephant in the room to me that we haven\\'t addressed via the story, which is that the business is a global business for sure, but really today, this business is an Asia business.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Here are some stats. In 2006, France was already down to 19% of sales. It started at 100% of sales, so that\\'s why I say down to 19% in 2006. This is a while ago or almost 20 years ago. At that point in time, Japan represented 27% of sales. There\\'s all this talk about China and luxury today, Japan was that in the early 2000s. Crazy, right? Japan was one and a half times France in terms of sales for Hermes.\\n\\nToday, France is down to just 9% of sales. Let\\'s flash back to 2006 again. We talked about Japan being at 27% of sales. Asia Pacific, outside of Japan, was only 17%. Japan was almost one and a half times as large as rest of Asia. Today, rest of Asia is 48%. Half of Hermes\\' business is Asia excluding Japan.\\n\\nDavid: AKA China.\\n\\nBen: Exactly. That\\'s crazy. I think Russia accounted for a decent amount of that.\\n\\nDavid: Interesting. The Japan story, actually, I think is still significant. Japan today is 10% of revenue?\\n\\nBen: Yeah, Japan\\'s larger than France. It\\'s 9% in France, 10% in Japan.\\n\\nDavid: Right. I actually looked into that and was like, huh. The rest of Asia, again, AKA China is 48% of the business. But on a per capita basis, Japan buys twice as much Hermes as China.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s interesting.\\n\\nDavid: Still, Japan is, I believe, around a 10th of the size of China and is 10% of Hermes sales versus 48% for rest of Asia. For a small country, like France, it\\'s still very, very significant for the business.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. I will say that you listen to management commentary. Hermes is very excited about China\\'s middle class, and they have done a really good job SKUing younger there. Eighty percent of clients in China are below 40.\\n\\nDavid: Wow. Again, this is a huge, unique success for Hermes. China has been big for the whole luxury industry over the last decade plus, but the past few years, particularly the last two years, China has been real tough for the luxury industry, and yet Hermes is still growing there.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Employee count, they have 21,000 total employees, 7000 are artisans, 62% of employees work in France. They really have stayed French, they\\'ve not outsourced. They have 54 production sites in France or what they call workshops, and they manufacture 76% of the objects that they sell in their stores in their own exclusive workshops. They do still have these partnerships with other companies that they own part of, just have a partnership with, or a distribution deal with. Usually what it means is it\\'s sold as an Hermes product, but it\\'s made by another manufacturer.\\n\\nOver the years, they\\'ve done this with shoes, umbrellas, leather jackets, raincoats, silverware, and glove. They\\'ve had all these independent craftsmen that they contracted with who have these really small shops, really small operations, and don\\'t have the brand reach that Hermes does, but they make Hermes products that are actually made by those people. So it\\'s interesting. I think they are decreasing that when I give the number that at this point, 76% of objects are made in its own exclusive workshops, but it is more correct than not to think about Hermes as they control everything from design to production, to brand, to retail today.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. I think a lot of those, there\\'s a silversmith and a tableware manufacturer that they own large stakes into, so it\\'s like a related party.\\n\\nBen: Yup, \\xa0exactly They have over 300 stores in 45 countries. David, as I mentioned earlier, in 2020, the Wall Street Journal estimated that about 120,000 Birkin and Kelly bags were made in that year. That\\'s about 25%-30% of total revenue coming from just those two bags, which again, you can\\'t buy, and also, you can\\'t even see.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, they\\'re not on display in the stores.\\n\\nBen: I went to a few Hermes stores over the last year, (1) because I love the brand, (2) because I was thinking we might do this episode at some point. I saw zero Birkin or Kelly bags even on display. This is the thing that they generate all their buzz about and make 30% of their revenue from, and you can\\'t see it in a store. Crazy.\\n\\nDavid: Totally crazy.\\n\\nBen: If you just do some napkin math at 25 hours per bag, that\\'s 1500 craftsmen just making Birkins and Kellys all day long.\\n\\nDavid: Sounds about right.\\n\\nBen: They have 16 métiers, and one in particular that I want to talk about is Petit H. This is one of my favorite Hermes things, period. It started in 2010. It\\'s a very interesting idea. For other leather brands, you typically see them trying to use the second best leather cut in some of their bags, but at Hermes they\\'ll never do that. There\\'s no bag that\\'s ever produced with any imperfections or any part of the leather that they think is any lesser than the best.\\n\\nWhat do they do with all that leftover material? For years, they were just storing it. This is everything from the leathers to the felts, to the silks. All this extra material where they were just like, there\\'s a tiny little bit that\\'s usable, but not enough to actually make another bag to our standards, so into the closet it goes.\\n\\nIn 2010, they launched Petit H. What they basically do is they collaborate with other artists for tiny little goods that can be cut from the scraps, that are super whimsical, super fun. Think luggage tags that are cute little animals. It\\'s just enough of a shape to know that it\\'s a bull, a bear, or a cat. You look at it and you\\'re like, oh, that\\'s really clever What they call it is creation in reverse, you start designing with the materials, not the end product in mind.\\n\\nIt\\'s the opposite of everything else that Hermes has ever done, which is think about what\\'s the perfect good we can create to solve this problem for a customer. This was like, no, we\\'ve got a bunch of scraps, what\\'s fun stuff we can do? That is that whimsy coming through.\\n\\nDavid: Yes.\\n\\nBen: One thing that I want to say about the luxury bubble cooling is that earlier, I chalked it up to, well, Hermes has the most exclusive brand posture, so they have the least price sensitive customers, so they\\'re going to feel the pullback less than everyone else. That is true, but there are other parts of it too.\\n\\nHermes\\' obsession with responsible growth, limiting production, and slower price appreciation also plays into the desirability and the durability of their goods. If they were out there cranking the prices of Birkin bags, you might think less of them. If they were out there trying to produce more of them to meet demand, you\\'d certainly think less of them, if they were outsourcing production anyway. It\\'s how they conduct business that has caused them to be in a better position than the rest of the luxury industry right now in this pullback.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'m glad you reminded me to bring this up. When we were talking earlier about the question of the secondary market and why are they leaving pricing power on the table.\\n\\nBen: Essentially, there\\'s consumer surplus in economic terms.\\n\\nDavid: Right. I said, I think they increased prices across the product range by about 7% per year. Where I got that from is if you look at the compounded annual revenue growth rate of Hermes for the last 10 years, the sixth generation era, it\\'s 15%. Revenue has grown 15% compounded annually since Axel took over in 2013. They\\'ve increased production 7% per year. That\\'s their stated goal.\\n\\nIf you say, okay, of the 15% revenue growth, take out the 7% production growth, that leaves 7%-8%. That\\'s got to be attributable to price increases, which I think this is the answer. Is it the right strategy? Probably it is the right strategy if you\\'re thinking about, hey, this is a generational business, we\\'re on the 6th generation. We want to ensure it\\'s around for the 12th generation. Yes, we\\'re leaving consumer surplus on the table here, because we don\\'t want to be seen as that brand that is $100,000 handbags, even though they are $100,000 handbags.\\n\\nBen: Right. Yeah, there\\'s a fine line.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s a gaucheness to it.\\n\\nBen: Right, exactly. They need to have a price that\\'s high enough to signal this is something really, really special. We are more unique than every other luxury brand who\\'s trying to make similar products and have similar positioning, but also it\\'s not so expensive that it\\'s gauche. I think the latter part, it\\'s not actually about the dollar amount. It\\'s about the price difference, because if it\\'s three times as much as it was a decade ago, it\\'s harder to trust the intrinsic value of the good if it\\'s fluctuating all over the place.\\n\\nDavid: There probably is an element of defense that they can fall back upon of, well, yes, we sell these things for $12,000, $20,000, whatever. But the moment you take possession, you can turn around and sell it for more.\\n\\nBen: This is an intentional strategy over a Rolex. They increase prices a certain amount per year, and they want to show a track record of that so that if you buy one, you can rest assured that it\\'s going to increase in value over time and that it\\'s a good investment, because counterintuitively, by increasing the price more than the rate of inflation every year, or especially more than the rate of 5%-7% stock market return, it spurs people to buy that otherwise wouldn\\'t have bought because they feel more safe making the purchase.\\n\\nDavid: This concept landed for me during our Porsche episode, working with Doug DeMuro. There\\'s a class of. Almost every car that you would ever buy. The old adage is true that the day you drive it off the lot, it\\'s worth 20% less than it was the day when you bought it. For luxury cars, collectors, cars, rare cars, et cetera, the opposite is true. These are investment vehicles. If you buy a Carrera GT, you\\'re going to spend a million dollars for it, but you can also be confident that you\\'re not going to lose money on that purchase. It\\'s an investment.\\n\\nBen: Right. There\\'s a business unit that we didn\\'t talk about yet called Hermes Horizons.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, which is not an official métier, right?\\n\\nBen: It is not a métier. They break it out under other products. They have four categories of other products. There\\'s Internet of Things, which is Apple Watch. There\\'s tanneries and precious leathers. There\\'s metal parts, which is a J3L subsidiary that I think literally makes the clasps and stuff like that.\\n\\nDavid: My deployment buckle.\\n\\nBen: Yes, and then there\\'s Hermes Horizons.\\n\\nDavid: This is so great.\\n\\nBen: Hermes Horizons is perfectly named. What it basically says is...\\n\\nDavid: If you have a private jet and you want it outfitted with Hermes seats, we\\'ve got the division for you.\\n\\nBen: We will make you seats.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. There\\'s an amazing quote from an article, probably 10, 15 years old. The person who is running this division said something like, \"We get a lot of clients who come in here, and they want a big H on whatever it is they want us to make. We have to have a discussion with those clients that if that\\'s what you want, we are not the place for you.\" It\\'s so great. Maybe one day be Hermes Horizons customers.\\n\\nBen: Maybe, we\\'ll see.\\n\\nDavid: All right. Let\\'s transition officially to analysis and start with power as we always do. Hamilton Helmer\\'s Seven Powers.\\n\\nBen: Listeners, this is the question of what enables a given business to achieve persistent differential returns or to be more profitable than their closest competitor on a sustainable basis. The seven that Hamilton has identified are counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs, network economies, process power, branding, and cornered resource.\\n\\nThe question we asked, David, on the LVMH episode was for luxury brands, is there anything else other than branding power? The definition of branding power is if I present you two identical objects, and one of them is branded and one of them is unbranded, it is literally quantified as the premium that you are willing to pay me for the brand. In Hermes\\' case, it may not actually be branded, but you might still know it as Hermes and be willing to pay more for it.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. If you know, you know.\\n\\nBen: Yes. Again, we\\'re drawing a lot of attention to quiet luxury here. Hermes is not as quiet luxury as they once were. I think it\\'s safe to say it would have an H, a horse, woven H into the fabric, or something like that if presented to you here. But obviously, there\\'s a tremendous amount of branding power.\\n\\nDavid: On the LVMH episode, we talked a lot about, and I think this truly was maybe the most brilliant thing that Bernard Arnault did. He realized when nobody else did that there were scale economies in luxury to a group of luxury brands. There\\'s the opposite of scale economies to an individual luxury brand, but at the group level, there is power and specifically scale economies power that does not exist the brand level. Clearly, none of that is happening here.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Okay. I have two cases to make for non-brand powers that come into play.\\n\\nDavid: Okay, great.\\n\\nBen: Cornered resource.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, I agree. They literally have all the craftsmen.\\n\\nDavid: Agree.\\n\\nBen: Except for the ones that are opening their own independent shop, and those ones don\\'t have brand power. An Hermes craftsman can make a wallet, an independent craftsman can make a wallet, you\\'re going to pay a lot more for the Hermes one. In fact, you\\'re never even going to be aware that the independent craftsman exists. If someone else wanted to go compete with Hermes, it\\'d be hard because they don\\'t have the brand, they don\\'t have the history, but also, you literally can\\'t find any more craftsmen, so you\\'d have to train them yourselves.\\n\\nDavid: I think even the other luxury brands out there, most of them probably do have some craftsmen, some stuff that\\'s done by hand, some components of some products done by hand. But nobody does what Hermes does, and Hermes does all the craftsmen, so cornered resource for sure.\\n\\nBen: Yup. The other one that is a little bit squishier, are they counter positioned to other luxury brands by basically saying, hey, we don\\'t have to serve as many customers as you, so we actually can handcraft each item individually? Louis Vuitton has no ability to switch gears and say, ooh, it\\'s important to compete on the vector of handcrafted.\\n\\nDavid: \\xa0Right, there are a lot of t shirts out there.\\n\\nBen: Right. They have to serve too many customers, but Hermès doesn\\'t. It\\'s flimsy counter positioning.\\n\\nDavid: No. I like that, actually. It\\'s rare to have counter positioning at scale. As Hamilton would put it, counter positioning is usually a takeoff phase power. I think there\\'s an element of that. You could dissect how much of that particular element is actually part of the Hermes brand versus counter positioning in and of itself, but I buy it. I think at the end of the day, though, we spent however long this episode will be when it ships, recounting the myth of the brand here like brand is the power.\\n\\nBen: Yup, brand is the power.\\n\\nDavid: Yes.\\n\\nBen: Okay, playbook. I called David earlier this week and said, we have a problem There\\'s this really good part of the LVMH episode, and we\\'re going to need to repeat it point for point on the Hermes episode, and that is why handbags are just the best freaking product to sell ever as a business. David planted the seed with me. Perhaps it\\'s actually going to be a pretty different point once we really tell the whole story. David, you are right.\\n\\nThe point that was made on the LVMH episode are handbags are the best product ever because they\\'re super easy to sell versus clothing. They don\\'t require you trying anything on or sizing. You look at it. If you like it, you buy it, done. Much better than a fashion product. They\\'re easier to create and produce than perfumes, which is another common luxury category\\n\\nThe profit margin is astounding for most luxury brands. The profit is between 10 and 12 times the cost to make them. At Louis Vuitton, it\\'s something like 13 times, so there\\'s this ease of creation. There\\'s high volume according to annual consumer surveys that coach does the average American woman purchased two new handbags in 2000. By 2004, that number was more than four, so it\\'s this high volume product.\\n\\nAt Louis Vuitton\\'s immense four floor global store in Tokyo, 40% of all sales are made in the first room, which sells only monogrammed handbags, wallets, and other leather goods. Basically, none of these are true for Hermès. The business is not high volume or not nearly as high volume as they could be. In fact, they don\\'t even show you handbags in their stores, so certainly not in that first room.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s amazing. At least in the Palo Alto Hermes, which is what I\\'ve most recently been in, you walk in and you would think this is a home wearers company. There\\'s a lot of table wear and there\\'s a lot of furniture.\\n\\nBen: There\\'s clothing, there\\'s ready to wear.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s clothing, there are some leather goods, and there are scarves. You would really think, wow, I\\'m in the most expensive Ikea ever.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s such a funny way to describe it. In terms of trying on the handbags, when you do get your moment in the sun, and you have your 90-minute appointment and your glass of champagne, and you have the opportunity to buy one of the two or three Birkin bags that they have in store...\\n\\nDavid: You can\\'t say no, you have already accepted.\\n\\nBen: Right. It doesn\\'t have the benefit of saving square footage the way that I mentioned. Oh, you don\\'t need to try on handbags. There\\'s nothing to impede your velocity. Hermes is impeding your velocity, and they\\'re taking up square footage with these private rooms for you to go and spend time in. They don\\'t take advantage of that benefit either.\\n\\nThe only thing that it has in common are these goods are sold at a phenomenal margin, just like Louis Vuitton. I came around to this idea that actually, we\\'re not making any of the same points at all. They managed to sell the same exact product category totally different, and they\\'ve constructed an entirely different business model around the same products.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. I think that\\'s really the story here. Yes, there are other brands. There\\'s Chanel, there\\'s Gucci, there\\'s Sicilia. I don\\'t want to say that those luxury brands and those handbag brands are not incredible. They are, but there\\'s Hermes and there\\'s Louis Vuitton. They\\'re both connected all the way back to Empress Eugenie, France, the nobility, and all of that. It\\'s so interesting that they have such different strategies and they are the two pinnacles.\\n\\nBen: Right. This is a good moment to bring up this idea that Hermes likes to espouse that they have no marketing department.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. This is a whimsical element of Hermes that I love.\\n\\nBen: Yes. They make the point that everyone at the company is responsible for marketing, which is wonderful. What a great comment, but there\\'s some truth to it. There\\'s obviously a lot of PR, events, and stuff that they do, but it\\'s worth looking at some of the numbers. They spend 23% of their revenue on sales and marketing costs, but just a small fraction of that is actually on marketing or what they call communication. It\\'s just 4.5% of their revenue.\\n\\nIf you compare that to LVMH, which spends over one third of their revenue on sales and marketing combined, that\\'s 23% for sales and marketing at Hermes compared to 33% at LVMH. That\\'s a huge difference. When you compare apples to apples just on marketing, LVMH says they spend 12% of total sales on advertising and promotion. Hermes spends 4.5% on communication. I think that is actually apples to apples.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, that\\'s the media spend of Hermes, I believe.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s still not right though. It\\'s all marketing, that 4.5% versus 12%. Remember, you pointed out to me earlier before recording, two thirds of Hermes\\' communication is actually events. If you look at the remaining third, it might be as low as one and a half percent of their sales are actually spent on media buys for marketing compared to LVMH\\'s 12%.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. This is really cool I saw a very large, splashy media buy from Hermes very recently. I was shocked when I saw it because I didn\\'t expect it, but then doing all the research, understanding the strategy, it makes total sense to me. It was at the Ballet here in San Francisco at SFB at the program for Mere Mortals, which was as I talked about on the Novo Nordisk episode, we went to see at opening night, just incredible, incredible piece allegory for Pandora\\'s box, AI, and ballet in the modern world here in San Francisco.\\n\\nThe back of the program was a full page Hermes ad. I was like, whoa, I think I texted you a picture. I was like, Hermes is buying full page marketing ads. But no, this is in the program at the ballet. This is not on the back of Vogue. There\\'s a difference.\\n\\nBen: Right. This is, in some ways, event spend.\\n\\nDavid: Yes. It\\'s much closer to that.\\n\\nBen: They also go really hard when they\\'re going to spend money. They don\\'t blanket the world. They decide these concentrated ways that they want to do something really unique and special. That\\'s how they spend their media buys.\\n\\nDavid: Also, their event spend, you might say, wait, how did they spend twice as much on events as they do on media? You haven\\'t read about Hermes events. Even just the pure marketing events like a store launch or product launch, they\\'ll spend a million dollars on a party.\\n\\nBen: Right. Another place that they save a lot of money is that they don\\'t do celebrity endorsements, unlike virtually every other luxury brand. This gets back to control, control, control. Hermes is the master of its own image. In these other companies, celebrities do dumb stuff all the time, and it reflects on the company. You have to change your spokesperson. You look at Kanye. You have to just decide to stick with him and tough it out, and Nike has done this a number of times, to say, we think we\\'re going to come out the other side, and we think they\\'re going to get through this.\\n\\nHermes, no. We control our own image, no one else reflects on us. Who needs celebrity endorsers when you make your products so desirable and so expensive that the celebrities will just buy them anyway, and they want to be seen in it? There are celebrities running around who get paid to endorse other brands, who will pay full price to wear Hermes out and about.\\n\\nDavid: Part of the status is getting the ability to buy one, getting the appointment with your SA, spending the money. That\\'s part of the status.\\n\\nBen: Not only is it revenue generating and cost saving, but it\\'s also more powerful than a paid endorsement because it\\'s authentic. It is what the celebrity is choosing to do with their dollars.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. I\\'m pretty sure that Grace Kelly bought her Sac a Depeches.\\n\\nBen: Unbelievable. At the end of the day, the Hermes brand really has a tremendous amount of word of mouth from people who are big fans of it. The brand is built through the lore around the products. They just don\\'t need to do that much media because they have a community. They have slowly organically built this, at this point, large number of people around the world that aspire to buy Hermes. Honestly, they just don\\'t need to do that much marketing.\\n\\nDavid: This is going to sound absurd on the surface, but I think it\\'s true. That audience is incredibly diverse. That audience is lots of customers in the Middle East. That audience is 40% plus China. That audience is still French people with the preface de in their names, i.e., old nobility. That audience is the wealthiest people in America. That audience is Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion.\\n\\nBen: As we talked about earlier, somehow there\\'s something about the French heritage that everyone else is willing to, status wise, look up to and want to participate in.\\n\\nDavid: Yup. I don\\'t think we want to go down this rabbit hole, but there is a whole TikTok and Instagram culture of Hermes sales associate appointments, Birkin appointments and reveals, and all that. It\\'s huge. There are millions and millions of people that watch this.\\n\\nBen: Yup. One thing that we did not talk about is how they merchandise the stores. This is another thing that sets Hermes apart from other brands. They have a pull model versus a push model for all you software engineers out there. Basically, they embrace this idea that every store is for the local clientele and that store managers know their clients the best. Therefore, store managers should get to pick what is in each store.\\n\\nHeadquarters does not dictate what every store stocks, which is super different than every other brand. You open retail stores in order to just get your product out. The point is distribution. Whatever salespeople we hire to work at those stores, they\\'re going to sell the same iPhones and iPads that we have everywhere else at every other store. That is not Hermes.\\n\\nAt Podium every year, which is this event that they have every six months where they show off all the new references, here\\'s all the new designs for all the new products, each store manager gets a budget. They have the freedom to \"buy\" basically stock and get allocations of whatever they want at their store under the constraint that you can\\'t ask for 120,000 Birkin bags at your one store.\\n\\nDavid: I believe there\\'s also regulation that every store needs to carry at least one item from each métier.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s cool. I didn\\'t realize that. I like that.\\n\\nDavid: This operates like a retail buying event. It\\'s bizarre, but awesome.\\n\\nBen: Even though they\\'re wholly owned, they get the benefit of not being wholly owned.\\n\\nDavid: Right, the market signals.\\n\\nBen: The cool thing about a retailer that\\'s decoupled from the manufacturer is that the retailer can stock whatever cool stuff they want. As long as the métiers are all producing a diverse set of references, then you actually do get this diversity of different things that are stocked at that store for that region. It leads to this cool thing that no two stores are identical. It\\'s fun to see what this Hermes shop has versus that Hermes shop whenever you travel.\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s a Costco treasure hunt element to it.\\n\\nBen: Yes, exactly. I will tell you, I was in the Aix-en-Provence store. Someone came in and said, I want to buy this particular item. The store manager said, well, we don\\'t have it. They have a policy against anyone calling ahead to know what\\'s where. He was asking, well, can you call the other store that I think was in Marseille or something like that and see if they have it there? She said, no, we don\\'t do that. You can go there and you can find out.\\n\\nI think this person was trying to buy something and flip it. They were on to that. He was also trying to take pictures of things in the store and they said, you can\\'t do that, sir. You can\\'t take photos of what we have in stock, because they don\\'t want people standing up websites to say, tip, go buy this here cause you can flip it online for that much. They have pretty tight controls around that.\\n\\nDavid: I love it. Luxury strategy, anti love marketing number six, dominate the client.\\n\\nBen: Dominate the client. Their ecommerce strategy is just pretty funny. It\\'s not like you can go online and buy a Birkin bag, but there\\'s not even a product detail page with a sold out button. There\\'s just this educational page about what Birkin bags are all about, how neat the designs are, and what the category is.\\n\\nDavid: But there\\'s no buy button.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s also for a different audience. Interestingly, 70% of buyers online for all the stuff that you can buy online were new to Hermes. That\\'s a great strategy for them for ecommerce that you say, look, the special things are the special things. But for people who we want to come experience the brand for the first time, great, we\\'ve got a website for you.\\n\\nI think you can sort of tell that internally they\\'re torn, since that\\'s not the full Hermes experience. You don\\'t get the experiential part of being in the store. But they also do a lot of volume through it, it\\'s a way to reach a new audience, and it\\'s an expectation at this point.\\n\\nDavid: This is a really uniquely Hermes thing and is related to their airport strategy too. I experienced this too. When I went to Palo Alto, I just walked into the store. I was pretty intimidated as a first time buyer and you don\\'t have an SA or sales associate relationship. It can feel very intimidating, especially knowing what I know about the company and the brand, the weight of history, walking into this store. It\\'s not like walking into an Ikea.\\n\\nThis is very intentional, the ecommerce strategy. The airport strategy is, hey, nobody feels intimidated in an airport. Obviously, you don\\'t have to have an appointment to walk into the airport Hermes store. It\\'s a way to get first time buyers into the fold, establish the relationship with them, and get them more comfortable in this buying experience, which is wholly unique to Hermes.\\n\\nBen: Yup. In some ways, it seems wholly on Hermes. But in other ways, the Apple watch thing that they do or the perfume, they are looking for ways to be more approachable.\\n\\nDavid: Right.\\n\\nBen: Another one worth mentioning is employee turnover. The employees, especially the craftsmen, basically stay forever. As we\\'ve been saying, there\\'s really no other game in town. If Hermes wasn\\'t there, these people probably wouldn\\'t have been trained to be craftsmen in the first place. What does that look like numerically? There is 6% annual turnover, and only 4.5% leave of their own desire. 4.5% of their entire workforce every year leaves of their own desire.\\n\\nDavid: That translates to a longer than 20-year average tenure. This is like Costco level employment retention.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s funny you say that. Costco is 7% a year, but Costco cheats a little bit and that the stat is after the first year, whereas Hermes is attrition of 6% and includes the first year.\\n\\nDavid: Wow.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. Just compare this with all industries in the US, that\\'s a 3.4% monthly turnover. In the United States across all industries, and thanks to Jeremy Diamond in the Slack for pointing this out, one third of the entire workforce churns on average every year. When you\\'re trying to figure out, is 6% good? Six percent is unbelievable, because the benchmark is 33%.\\n\\nDavid: Especially in the context of think about the two areas that are the bulk of Hermes\\' employees. It\\'s craftspeople and sales associates.\\n\\nBen: Which if you are to use different language is manufacturing and retail, which are super high churn categories.\\n\\nDavid: Right, that\\'s the point I\\'m making.\\n\\nBen: Even software developers churn at 15%-20% per year, and that\\'s just the voluntary numbers. This is much better than software engineers who get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to have a very cushy job. Finally, let\\'s go real apples to apples. Let\\'s compare this to LVMH.\\n\\nLVMH is total turnover in 2022 was 24% versus Hermes\\' 6%. Hermes may be obsessed with this whole savoir faire, transmission of craft, and their annual report, but it is totally real. The entire thing works because of the knowledge and craft of their people.\\n\\nDavid: They have incredible YouTube videos and documentaries. They put out like you referenced. You go see these people and you really feel, like factories. They\\'re not factories. These ateliers are something truly unique.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, and they\\'re only getting more obsessed with controlling everything end to end. Hermes used to have 56% of retail locations that were company owned. This is back in 2003, so 20 years ago. A little over half were company owned. That\\'s now 74%. They\\'re getting rid of what they refer to as the concessionaires, which are essentially franchise stores and closing them in favor of the wholly owned businesses.\\n\\nAgain, they\\'re just trying to figure out, how do we control more of our production of our everything soup to nuts? They describe this strategy as having three pillars. This is three pillars for their entire business. This is the strategy at the top of the annual report. Creation, craftsmanship, and an exclusive distribution network. That\\'s probably the way to sum up Hermes.\\n\\nAll right, to close playbook, I just have one more, which is really this idea of, what is the job to be done by Hermes? I had this great conversation with Derek Guy. He\\'s colloquially known on Twitter as the menswear guy, @dieworkwear is his handle. He has some amazing threads. They\\'re very worth reading about if you\\'re interested in ironing pants or why suits don\\'t fit the way they used to.\\n\\nHe pointed out this really interesting thing to me, which is the value propositions of Hermes are essentially a bundle. That bundle is exclusivity, service, craftsmanship, shopping experience, and a great brand. You basically can\\'t get that bundle anywhere else. That doesn\\'t have competitors.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, you can get individual elements of that bundle elsewhere.\\n\\nBen: Absolutely.\\n\\nDavid: But by nature, given what this is in the luxury industry, you can\\'t assemble this experience, the Hermes experience, out of separate components.\\n\\nBen: It used to exist. In a pre war, early 20th century era, you could. But Hermes was the only one that sort of chose to keep doing things the old way and scale, and everyone else kind of went out of business or changed their methodology to scale. For example, Louis Vuitton has the branding. They have exclusivity, but the craftsmanship isn\\'t there. They don\\'t make things in that early 20th century way.\\n\\nSupreme can offer you exclusivity and brand, but again, there\\'s no real craftsmanship there. You\\'ve got all these individual artisans, a craftsperson and a little workshop somewhere in Paris making the highest quality, Hermes quality things, but there\\'s no brand. Would you buy that? Would you pay even half the price for that? I think a lot of people who are buying Hermes are buying it because it\\'s Hermes. And they want the brand.\\n\\nThere are other things that are missing from that too. There\\'s no shopping experience, service is unknown because you don\\'t know how long that maker is going to be around. You know for a fact that 50 years from now, you can get your Hermes thing serviced. There\\'s some great makers like Chester Mox, April in Paris, or I heard great things about Mila Jito. These are exceptional craftsmen, hand making items in the same way, but it\\'s a different bundle of value propositions.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah, completely different product.\\n\\nBen: To me, what sums up the analysis is that the magic of what Hermes has done is managed to scale the old way with the complete bundle.\\n\\nDavid: Yup, totally agree. Nothing more to add.\\n\\nBen: Thanks, Charlie.\\n\\nDavid: All right, should we do value creation capture, and then we\\'ve got a new way to wrap up episodes here?\\n\\nBen: Yes This section was originally created by us five years ago or something to basically assess of the value created in the world. How much does the company actually capture of it? Canonically, Craigslist creates a ton of value. Wikipedia creates a ton of value. It capture\\'s very little of it. On the other hand, Google create a lot of value, you can find stuff on the internet. They\\'re pretty damn good at capturing it. They\\'ve built a huge business on that.\\n\\nThere, I think, is a reasonable indictment to make that many of you will want to make on all of luxury and say, it\\'s just excess, they don\\'t actually create value in the world, and then they capture a tremendous amount of value because they just have a brand that allows people to social signal, and all luxury is excess. That\\'s a reasonable viewpoint.\\n\\nHowever, I think there\\'s an interesting way to look at Hermes in particular, which is if what you desire is the highest quality craft they offer at an extreme price, a guarantee to be able to get that super high quality craft. That\\'s different than every other luxury brand that is no longer about craftsmanship, but it\\'s about hype and logos.\\n\\nDavid: Brands. Let\\'s bring up brand and fashion.\\n\\nBen: Yes. I would say, Hermes has figured out that there actually is a pretty big niche for craftsmanship or at least people who desire the brand of craftsmanship, and they\\'re exceptional at value capture around that.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s interesting. Yes, but the secondary market is this very direct, if you\\'re talking purely about economic value creation, value capture. Very direct data point that, no, they are leaving a lot of surplus on the table for their consumers.\\n\\nBen: Another element to value creation, value capture is what they\\'re doing good for the world, period, regardless of what they\\'re able to capture. Anybody who\\'s doing things with exotic leathers, you may have a problem with. Farmed crocodiles in mass quantities in order to create the Himalaya print Birkin bags\\n\\nDavid: There\\'s actually a brief period where Jane Birkin boycotted Hermes bags and asked them to take her name off of them.\\n\\nBen: Do you know how that got solved? Why is she cool with it now?\\n\\nDavid: I could be wrong, but I believe this is when Hermes took the crocodile farming in-house and improved a lot of the animal welfare standards.\\n\\nBen: For everyone who\\'s like, it\\'s absolutely cruel to do this to crocodiles, to make handbags, Hermes doesn\\'t really have a counterpoint. They don\\'t have like a, well, they live good lives. That\\'s not a part of their defense. Their defense is purely around sustainable farming, which is, hey, these are endangered species in many scenarios with these exotic leathers. What we do is for the ones that we farm, we also release a bunch into the wild to try to replenish the population.\\n\\nEven though we\\'re not actually taking away from the population in the wild because we\\'re not hunting them, we are trying to, almost in an eye for an eye way, say, look, we\\'re creating a bunch of crocodiles, so we\\'re releasing a bunch of them into nature also. I don\\'t know, it sits medium with me.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. It\\'s not a great response.\\n\\nBen: Right. Similarly, you see piles and piles and piles of cow hides for the leather production. The response is, well, look, these were beef cows, so we\\'re basically doing. a good thing by making sure that we use the whole animal since we were going to use it anyway for sustenance somewhere else in humanity.\\n\\nDavid: To me, that is a better argument than we farm the crocodiles for the skins. It\\'s funny. Actually, doing the Novo Nordisk episode gave me a new perspective on this with animal products, and obviously insulin doesn\\'t come from animals anymore. It\\'s genetically engineered, but a lot of pigs and cows went into producing insulin for many many many decades. That\\'s a new perspective to look at things because people would have died otherwise. Is that what\\'s happening here with Hermes? Absolutely not.\\n\\nBen: Right. Other brands, Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld, Mulberry, a bunch of them are banning exotic leathers in their products. I think Hermes has played around with mushroom leather, but do I think Hermes is going to go all vegan anytime soon? Absolutely not. It\\'s just not happening.\\n\\nThe last thing that you can definitely be mad about if you are into animal welfare is the fact that Hermes cares so deeply about their brand that they burn imperfect products so they never see the light of day. That\\'s a bummer. I understand Hermes\\' position of not wanting these bags to get out there and have their brand on it. People realize, oh, some Birkin bags look crappy. But if you\\'re destroying product that could otherwise have utility, especially when it\\'s made from animals, bummer.\\n\\nDavid: Agreed.\\n\\nBen: They spend a lot of time in their annual report talking about how much more they\\'re getting efficient in their manufacturing processes, how the rates of this are going down. They don\\'t specifically call out burning bags, but how they\\'re able to use more and more of the raw material and have everything that goes in the top of the funnel get used in products all the way at the bottom of the funnel. The company has taken a lot of heat for it over the years, and it\\'s something that they spend a lot of time working on.\\n\\nAll right. David, I think that brings us to the question, which is, what is your big takeaway from this episode? What is a big idea you\\'re obsessed with after spending all this time with Hermes?\\n\\nDavid: We\\'ve been struggling for a while with, how do we end these episodes, these books that we\\'re in right now?\\n\\nBen: Right, we\\'re not going to grade them the way that we used to grade.\\n\\nDavid: Right, that doesn\\'t make sense. That was always hokey anyway. We\\'ve done bear case and bull case. Again, are we going to do that better than an equity research analyst? I don\\'t know.\\n\\nBen: Importantly, bear case bull case has to take into account what people\\'s current expectations, so you have to dissect the stock price.\\n\\nDavid: Right, which isn\\'t really the point of Acquired.\\n\\nBen: Right. We figure by the time you get to this point of the episode, you already have a bear case and a bull case in your head. It\\'s not like we\\'re going to sit here and paint, well, if people keep being excited about luxury goods...\\n\\nDavid: Here\\'s an incredible new insight that will change your perspective on the stock. No.\\n\\nBen: Right.\\n\\nDavid: We\\'ve been casting about for honestly a while here of like, how do we land the plane on these episodes? What we\\'re trying here for the first time, and let us know what you think if you like it, is in a very Hermes like way, we dedicate really a month plus of our life to each of these episodes. This is all we\\'re doing for certainly the last four weeks. Every day we\\'ve been getting up, we\\'ve been studying this company, we\\'ve been writing. It\\'s insane.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s craft. We joke, but it\\'s craft.\\n\\nDavid: Really, like you said, Ben, this episode started a year ago when we did the LVMH episode, and it\\'s been percolating and percolating and percolating. The last four weeks, it\\'s been every waking moment for us. I think a fun way to try to end the episode is when we wake up in the middle of the night and Hermes is on our mind, what are the aspects of Hermes and why?\\n\\nIt ends up being personal for us. What resonates for us from having told this story, done this work, and what resonates for Acquired, honestly? For me, we\\'ve touched on this a little bit throughout the episode with the whimsy and the dream element of Hermes, but there\\'s something also to this company that I think is deeply interconnected with the fact that it\\'s on the sixth generation of the family.\\n\\nYou ask yourself, how is that possible? How six generations later is this company stronger than ever, and the family members are more committed than ever to running it? I think it\\'s because they have fun. Again, this comes through in the whimsy. This comes through in the annual reports. This comes through when you watch the interviews with Axel and Pierre-Alexis, when you read the articles, and hear people talk like Beatrice about Jean-Louis, they are really having fun doing what they\\'re doing.\\n\\nIt\\'s an amazing culture, and it\\'s hard to have in an environment where you are also, I think, the 47th largest market cap company in the world. I think about other companies, it\\'s about winning. You think about a professional sports team. I think my mind goes to like the New England Patriots. Honestly, it goes to like Benchmark and Sequoia, like the best venture capital firms out there. These are organizations that are 100% dedicated to winning. It\\'s not that Hermes isn\\'t dedicated to winning, but they\\'re even more so dedicated to having fun and enjoying themselves.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. They’re fun and they\\'re staying true to their identity. Both of those things are more important than winning some numerical game.\\n\\nDavid: Right. For me, that\\'s the splinter in my mind over the last set of months with Hermes. Honestly, it\\'s what acquired is for me and for us. Hermes could go out tomorrow and they could follow the consultants. They could borrow a page from the LVMH playbook, and they could vastly increase their sales and profitability overnight. If they were solely focused on winning, that might be what they do, but they are never going to do that.\\n\\nBen: But if they do that, it\\'s still only a short term right thing to do.\\n\\nDavid: Right. I think it\\'s tied into this short term, long term perspective thing. The reason I say it\\'s fun is the family wants to keep doing this. If it weren\\'t fun, they would probably maximize value, they would hit the short term bid, and they would sell to Bernard. But they don\\'t.\\n\\nBen: Yup, I love that. The splinter in my mind is that you can sell what on the face of it seems like the same type of products as someone else, but build two entirely different businesses. Louis Vuitton and Hermes, on the face of it, do the same thing. As soon as you start digging in, you realize that these companies could not be more different. All of the puzzle pieces that fit together to create Hermes is an entirely different puzzle than the pieces that fit together to create Louis Vuitton.\\n\\nIt\\'s a great reminder that just because you are in the same product category as someone else, you don\\'t have to build a similar business, and you might not even be competing with them. There\\'s a large number of people for whom Louis Vuitton and Hermes are not actually in a consideration set together ever. I think that\\'s fascinating.\\n\\nDavid: Right. These are Mutually exclusive brands for a lot of people. Certainly not all, but a lot of people. I was thinking about that too a little bit in the context of, oftentimes in a market, the best way to compete with your best competitor is to do the exact opposite of them, it\\'s not to compete with them.\\n\\nBen: Or at least be open to a, we don\\'t have to do anything alike. Open to that idea.\\n\\nDavid: Right. This is Android and iOS.\\n\\nBen: Right.\\n\\nDavid: All right. That\\'s our landing of the Hermes plane. Let us know what you think. I just love doing this one. This was one of the most enjoyable experiences for me. All of our episodes are, but I just really loved this one.\\n\\nBen: Sometimes we get to learn about an industry that\\'s interesting to know things about like healthcare or something we\\'re a fan of, like the NFL episode. But sometimes we do an episode like Hermes and it really teaches us how to run our own business. Again, Acquired is not luxury, but we do create a product that has real scarcity, both on the listener front, because we only have an episode a month and on the sponsor front, because we only have three sponsors a season. There is so much to learn studying the purity of Hermes when you run a business that\\'s predicated on scarcity.\\n\\nDavid: Yes.\\n\\nBen: This one was extra indulgent for you and I.\\n\\nDavid: Yes, totally. Okay, carveouts. Let\\'s do it. What you got?\\n\\nBen: I have three.\\n\\nDavid: Fun.\\n\\nBen: And none of them are a Vision Pro, even though the Vision Pro is sitting next to me on my desk. The reason is not because I can\\'t recommend it, but because this is Acquired, and we can\\'t possibly do anything that\\'s too current. I need more time to evaluate.\\n\\nDavid: The Hermes of podcast indeed.\\n\\nBen: Okay. First one, the Anker Prime charger. I\\'ll give you the model number, because Anker products are impossible to figure out what\\'s what. This is the A2343 model. It is a 100-watt charger that has two USB C ports and one USB A port, and it is tiny. It\\'s lightweight. It\\'s dense. You\\'ll pick it up and be like, oh, my God, this is really heavy, but it\\'s lightweight compared to large bricks.\\n\\nHere\\'s the important thing. In those diagonal airline charging seats, you can plug it in and it doesn\\'t fall out. It\\'s a hundred watts. You can super fast charge phone, laptop, whatever. There are two ports, two USB ports and one USB A, and it works on airlines. It\\'s the only thing that I travel with now. It\\'s the new gallium nitride GAN charging technology, which I think is totally game changing.\\n\\nDavid: Nice. I\\'ve got a 60-watt Anker that is same concept. Totally, the \\xa0only thing I travel with.\\n\\nBen: Is it gallium nitride?\\n\\nDavid: No, it\\'s a few years old.\\n\\nBen: Okay, yeah. I don\\'t understand why nobody\\'s talking about it, because it feels like it completely revolutionized chargers. It makes everything 50% the size, even though it has super high power delivery.\\n\\nDavid: I might need to upgrade my travel setup. Maybe I need an Hermes leather case for it.\\n\\nBen: Might need to do it. All right, we\\'ll link it in the show notes. Two more are apps, websites, or web services. I don\\'t know what we\\'re supposed to call them these days. The first one is an app called Matter, which I have replaced. For years, I used Instapaper. It was great, but it just hasn\\'t been touched in forever.\\n\\nMatter is Instapaper but better. It is also an amazing way to listen to things that you save in a very realistic voice. Long time listeners know, I don\\'t absorb stuff very well by reading. I absorb it really well by listening.\\n\\nDavid: You\\'re talking about text to speech, not saving podcast episodes.\\n\\nBen: Correct. You can save podcast episodes, but you can forward an email newsletter and have that read it to you. You can use the bookmarklet on a website and have it read it to you. It bundles in text to speech, podcasts, email newsletters, and read it later type services into one app. I did half the research for this by taking long things to read including PDFs. It has an ability to parse PDFs now and listening while running.\\n\\nMy son was asleep in a carrier and I\\'m walking around the house, I\\'m in a dark room somewhere, or I\\'m on the treadmill in the garage. I really like Matter. The team behind it is awesome. They actually were kind enough to reach out and have David and I collaborate with them on a couple of guest blog posts for their Words that Matter series of some of our favorite readings and writings of all time. The team was great, which was my entree into it, but the product has exceeded expectations.\\n\\nDavid: Okay. I haven\\'t actually tried the app yet. I love those guys, now I got to try the app.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s awesome. My third one is another thing that dramatically has helped my research, which is Perplexity AI.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah.\\n\\nBen: If I could stop using Google, I would, because Perplexity is better for everything that I use to Google, period.\\n\\nDavid: Wow, okay. All right, we got to have Perplexity on ACQ2 or something. More to come on this.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s all the good things about ChatGPT, all the good things about Google, and none of the bad things of either. It\\'s reliable, it links to sources, it has good UI. I trust it because I\\'ve fact checked it so many times, and it just keeps being right. It makes it easy to fact check. Accessing information is one of these things that if it\\'s 97% good, it\\'s bad. So it needs to be always good.\\n\\nDavid: Honestly, this is why I don\\'t use ChatGPT for acquired work, I feel like we need to be a hundred percent all the time.\\n\\nBen: Here\\'s the best use case for perplexity. The other day, I couldn\\'t find something on Google. I went over to perplexity, I asked it the question, and it said, the answer to this is unknown on the internet. I was like, that is amazing. You just gave me confidence.\\n\\nDavid: Getting that answer. Otherwise, you\\'re going to spend half an hour on Google trying to find it.\\n\\nBen: Yes.\\n\\nDavid: That\\'s amazing.\\n\\nBen: It was both time saving and confidence inducing.\\n\\nDavid: I love it. Okay. I\\'ve heard from so many people about Perplexity. I got to give it a go in the next episode research.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s phenomenal.\\n\\nDavid: I\\'m so disappointed in myself, but also it\\'s just the reality of my life right now. I\\'ve become the middle of the bell curve technology adopter. I used to be the bleeding edge early adopter. Man, getting old is hard. Joanna Stern had a great quote about this in the Wall Street Journal, and she was interviewed by Ben Thompson recently. She said, \"Man, I wish I had the access that I have now when I was younger.\" I would be unstoppable pulling all nighters. I\\'d be using it to its full degree. I don\\'t have the energy now. I got kids. I\\'m like, man, I feel that.\\n\\nBen: That\\'s the paradox. You often do your best work when you get older, even though you have less time because you\\'re wiser, your information\\'s better.\\n\\nDavid: Your access, everything.\\n\\nBen: Yeah. You\\'ve gotten better at your craft. You can never have both, but you live your life anyway. You\\'ll make it through.\\n\\nDavid: What\\'s the Dune quote? Life is not a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.\\n\\nBen: Yeah, I think that is it.\\n\\nDavid: There you go. Okay, my carve out. We are recording this. By the time the episode comes out, the Super Bowl will have been played and won by somebody. Man, I am fired up. Go Niners, San Francisco 49ers, Brock Purdy. Hell yeah. I\\'m channeling my inner JT O\\'Sullivan and QB School YouTube channel here. I\\'m so excited. Brock\\'s story is amazing. I was trying to think, okay, I can\\'t have the Niners and the Super Bowl be my carve out.\\n\\nBen: Especially if this airs after they lose. Are we leaving it in?\\n\\nDavid: Right, especially if they lose. But what I can have as my carve out and is perfect for Acquired, years ago, I read Bill Walsh\\'s book. Bill Walsh was the legendary coach of the 49ers during the Joe Montana, Steve Young era. He invented the West Coast offense. He wrote this book called The Score Takes Care of Itself, and it\\'s so good. It\\'s just like a great leadership book, but the title says it all.\\n\\nIt\\'s related to Hermes, it\\'s related to Acquired. It\\'s the splinter in the mind, everything we\\'ve been talking about. It includes some ideas like scripting. This is now so commonplace in the NFL and football everywhere, but everybody scripts out your first set of 5, 10, 20 plays, et cetera. Bill Walsh invented that. We do the same thing on Acquired. We have scripts, I have a script, and you have a script. Obviously, the episode doesn\\'t follow the script any more than an NFL game.\\n\\nBen: But you need a way to start that\\'s predictable or at least something you\\'ve thought through.\\n\\nDavid: Right. Obviously, Bill Walsh didn\\'t invent that idea writ large, but he invented it for the NFL. There\\'s also some really good stuff in there about when to persist with doing something different and continue to do it versus stop doing it, and what are the right reasons to do it? Especially in the early days when it\\'s working or not working, I\\'m thinking about launching the Birkin and all that. Anyway, it\\'s a great book. Bill Walsh was a legendary figure. Go Niners. Hell yeah.\\n\\nBen: There you go. Wishing you the best of luck. Listeners, you know it already happened.\\n\\nDavid: Either way, I\\'m celebrating because either the Niners won, or we\\'re going to see a lot of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, so I\\'m thrilled.\\n\\nBen: I tweeted this that Taylor plus the NFL is literally the perfect bundle, because they\\'ve both fully saturated their markets that Taylor is America\\'s musical cultural icon of this moment. There\\'s no one who could be a Taylor superfan. That\\'s not already a Taylor superfan. The NFL similarly has had close to a hundred year history, and it is the fullest realization of itself already. The NFL is America\\'s sport, so they\\'ve already got all the superfans they\\'re going to get. By bundling together, this is so awful.\\n\\nDavid: No, this is the ultimate collab.\\n\\nBen: Yes. They can address each other as casual fans who wouldn\\'t have tuned in specifically for one or the other.\\n\\nDavid: Taylor is a hundred percent thing. I\\'m not saying she\\'s dating Travis because of this, but Taylor is one of the smartest CEOs in the world, writ large, period, bar none. Of course, she\\'s thinking about this.\\n\\nBen: Yup. What\\'s the phrase that Shishir Mehrotra used? The marginal churn contribution. There are people who will not turn off the Super Bowl who otherwise would have because there might be another Taylor viewing.\\n\\nDavid: Jenny has negative interest in football, but she\\'s telling me about what Taylor is wearing, whether she\\'s going to be able to make it back from Japan from the Super Bowl.\\n\\nBen: We\\'ll see. All right, listeners, we have a bunch of thank yous. Huge thank you to Domenico De Sole, the former CEO of Gucci and the co-founder of Tom Ford with Tom Ford. Domenico, your conversation was just invaluable in preparing for this episode, and obviously, yes, a legend. Adam Pritzker, a good friend of the show, is the co-founder of Assembled Brands and the company Kate, which is in the fashion and luxury space. Adam is Super kind and a huge contributor to this episode, just like he was to LVMH.\\n\\nTo Derek Guy, who is @dieworkwear on Twitter for teaching me about saddle stitching, what makes Hermes special, and a bunch of the other brands that we mentioned that do boutique leather goods, and for putting April in Paris on my radar. That was very helpful. Reginald-Jerome de Mans or RJ, which is a funny pen name, he wrote a book called Swan Songs: Souvenirs of Paris Elegance. He\\'s obsessed, for lack of a better phrase, with Parisian luxury and the history of it. It was really educational to talk with him about this and fact check a lot of my Hermes history.\\n\\nFinally, there is a lot written about the company. I do think the best way to understand Hermes is just to go right to the source. There are 586-page annual report. They just lay out the whole strategy. If you\\'re curious about the company, that\\'s an amazing place to look.\\n\\nDavid: It\\'s funny, we did not talk to anyone at the company we\\'d usually never do when we\\'re making an episode.\\n\\nBen: It\\'s just awkward.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. We usually talk to them afterwards, but not during. In this case, we didn\\'t need to. It\\'s right there. They wrote down everything.\\n\\nBen: Yup. David, I know you had a couple of cool conversations.\\n\\nDavid: Yeah. Speaking of April in Paris, Beatrice Amblard here in San Francisco, was so fun to talk to, an actual former Hermes artisan. There\\'s personal stories of Jean-Louis and the family. They really gave me a sense of just how special the family is, the company is, and the work that they do.\\n\\nI also have to think Lauren Sherman. Lauren is, I think, pretty much bar none, the very best business of fashion and business of luxury reporter out there. She was at the business of fashion for a long time. She\\'s now at Puck. She\\'s Puck\\'s fashion correspondent. She launched the fashion vertical for Puck.\\n\\nLauren is awesome. I chatted with her for a long time. She gave me a lot of great perspective on Hermes within the industry. Really, there are a few journalists out there. I\\'m thinking of Brad Stone, Emily Chang at Bloomberg, and Kara Swisher obviously, but they\\'re incredible journalists. They really, really understand the business and the industry that they\\'re covering, and Lauren is one of those. It was super great to get to chat with her.\\n\\nBen: Yup. Our huge thank you to JP Morgan Payments, ServiceNow, and Vanta. You can click the link in the show notes to learn more about each of those companies. You can sign up for notifications on when new episodes drop at acquired.fm/email. You can also get little tidbits at what next episode will be and play the guessing game with the rest of the community at acquired.fm/slack. We\\'ll also be including listener corrections in acquired.fm/email.\\n\\nSubscribe to ACQ2 in any podcast player. We\\'ve got some great ones coming. After you finish this episode, come get some of that sweet Acquired merch that everyone is talking about at acquired.fm/store.\\n\\nDavid: Acquired-Hermes collab coming soon.\\n\\nBen: One day. We will see you next time.\\n\\nDavid: We will see you next time.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  'followups_and_corrections': 'Follow-Ups and Corrections:\\n\\n• You cannot and should not actually wear a Birkin over your shoulder, as described in the episode. (How gauche of us!) It’s a tote, and should be carried by hand or in the crook of your arm. Thank you to our more cultured listeners for pointing this out. :)\\n\\n• The H51 bylawsare actually available publicly! (In French, naturally.) Big thank you to listener Nicholas Cullen for sending our way. A few highlights from him:Article 11 says only descendants of Emile Hermès and his wife Julie Hollande can be shareholders.Article 7.2.2 says shareholders can ask the company to buy their B shares from them starting in January 2041.Article 19.3.4(iii) states that any transfer of Hermès International shares to any person requires a 3/4 majority shareholders’ vote, except in the case where an H51 shareholder exercises its right under article 7.2 to ask the company to buy its B shares for a mix of cash and Hermès International shares following the end of the lock-in period.\\n\\n• Article 11 says only descendants of Emile Hermès and his wife Julie Hollande can be shareholders.\\n\\n• Article 7.2.2 says shareholders can ask the company to buy their B shares from them starting in January 2041.\\n\\n• Article 19.3.4(iii) states that any transfer of Hermès International shares to any person requires a 3/4 majority shareholders’ vote, except in the case where an H51 shareholder exercises its right under article 7.2 to ask the company to buy its B shares for a mix of cash and Hermès International shares following the end of the lock-in period.\\n\\n• Not a correction, but Hermès is officially Acquired’s biggest season episode of all-time.
